"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fibers: 2 bolts
White fibers: Half of 2 bolts, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

James runs 60 meters per sprint. He does 3 sprints per week. 

60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

James runs 180 meters per week."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far and subtract that from the total daily amount.

She gives 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. 
15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed given so far.

Since Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of feed per chicken per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total daily amount of feed needed is:
3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

Now, subtract the amount of feed given so far from the total daily amount:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

Now, let's add the cost of the first glass and the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

Kylar needs to pay $50 for 16 glasses."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file and the time it takes to restart the download:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

1. The first 3 hours, John drives at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

2. He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. Distance = 0 miles.

3. After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, we add up the distances from each segment: 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

So, John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial cost and does not take into account the fact that the tree will start producing lemons after the first year. 

So, we need to subtract 1 from the result to get the correct number of years:

12 years - 1 year = 11 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 11 years for the lemon tree to start earning money.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + x/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms again:

x - 2x/3 - 3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 9 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 9 = 15

Add 9 to both sides:

x = 24

So Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value of electronic gadgets - Initial cost
= $8,160 - $8,000
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. 

On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

Now, let's add the distances covered on both days:
- Westward distance: 80 miles + 80 miles = 160 miles
- Northward distance: 150 miles + 150 miles = 300 miles

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 160 miles westward and 300 miles northward.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Annual hours worked: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual salary from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Her annual salary from coaching: 
- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Annual hours worked: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual salary from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: $35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4 to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she should spend walking the entire trail.

Total time for 12 miles at 4 miles per hour = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to complete the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can use the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 8 miles per hour

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When you spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of water to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 46/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

The final answer is 16.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. To find the number of years ago that Raymond's son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Years ago = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at son's birth
Years ago = 25 - 23
Years ago = 2

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost the same amount, we can set up the equation: 
Boots + $99 = Total cost of boots and heels

We know that the total cost of the boots and heels is equal to the cost of the boots. So, we can rewrite the equation as:
Boots + $99 = Boots

Subtracting $99 from both sides of the equation, we get:
Boots - $99 = 0

Adding $99 to both sides of the equation, we get:
Boots = $99

The final answer is: $99"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The third person said 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Final answer: $75.00"
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left, we can find the amount he spent on video games and Lego sets by subtracting the amount he had left from the total amount he got: $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Now, we know that John spent $30 on video games and Lego sets. We also know that he spent $160 on video games. To find out how much he spent on Lego sets, we subtract the cost of video games from the total amount he spent: $30 - $160 = -$130. However, this is not possible since he can't spend a negative amount. This means we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that John spent $160 on video games and had $5 left. This means he had $195 - $160 - $5 = $30 left after buying the video games. Since he spent $30 on video games and Lego sets, and we know that he spent $160 on video games, we can find the amount he spent on Lego sets by subtracting the cost of video games from the amount he had left: $30 - $160 is not correct. We need to find the amount he spent on Lego sets.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that John had $195 initially and spent $160 on video games. This means he had $195 - $160 = $35 left. We also know that he had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he spent $35 - $5 = $30 on Lego sets.

Now, we know that John spent $30 on Lego sets. We can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount he spent on Lego sets by the price of each Lego set: $30 / $15 = 2.

Since John initially had 13 Lego sets and sold 2, we can find the number of Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the initial number of Lego sets: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
- He runs 60 miles a week.
- He runs 3 days a week, so the distance for the first day is 60 miles.
- The distance for the other two days is half of the first day, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per day.
- Total distance for the other two days is 30 * 2 = 60 miles.
- Total distance for the week is 60 + 60 = 120 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- He runs half as much on the other two days, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
- Total time for the other two days is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.
- Total time for the week is 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate his running speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 20 miles per hour.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

In 2 hours, Dana can travel 2 * 6 = 12 miles running. In 2 hours, she can travel 2 * 3 = 6 miles walking.

The total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Remaining pieces = 14

Pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of candles sold = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost:
Number of pounds of beeswax = 20 / 10 (since 10 candles can be made from 1 pound of beeswax)
Number of pounds of beeswax = 2
Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks = $10.00
Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax * Cost per pound of beeswax
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles, and each article takes 4 hours to write, so the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. The total hours spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles. The total hours spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice initially had, we need to add the notes she put on the cups of coffee to the notes she had remaining.

She put 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee and had 23 remaining. 

Total notes initially = 220 (on cups) + 23 (remaining) = 243

Since Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased can be found by subtracting the initial number from the total.

Number of Post-it notes in the package = Total notes initially - Initial notes in purse
= 243 - 80

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

10 red ties * $60 per tie = $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:

$200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 (Friday) is greater than $520 (Thursday). 
To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means Friday's revenue was lower than Thursday's revenue.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 3 oranges

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe and bad/sour oranges from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 5 (unripe) - 3 (bad/sour) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the brooch first. 

The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of construction is $800. 
So, the total cost of the brooch is $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost. 
10% of $1300 is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the brooch. 
$1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the initial pension is $50,000, the value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to calculate 5% of $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000.

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $50,000 (initial pension) + $50,000 (5% of the value of the pension) = $100,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she has already used (4 gallons) and then add the distance she has already traveled (100 miles).

First, let's calculate the remaining capacity of her tank:
12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Now, let's calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank:
8 gallons (remaining) * 25 miles per gallon (average miles per gallon) = 200 miles

However, since she has already traveled 100 miles, we need to add that to the total distance:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost and the total interest to get the total amount Shiela will pay for 3 months. 

Total amount = $750 (cost) + $15 (interest) = $765.

"To find the number of games won, we need to first determine the number of games lost. 

Let's say the number of games lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost is 7, we can find the number of games won:

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets the three have: 
4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
x = 38 - 2
x = 36

So, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change. To find his new time, we can calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 seconds is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Now, we can add this to his original time to find his new time:
36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds with his improved diet.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

16 ounces / 3 tomatoes = 5.33 tomatoes

So, Freda used approximately 5.33 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. 

In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam. Let's call the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes 'x'. 

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam. 

We also know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 'x + 20 - 5'. 

Since the total number of cars on the motorway is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20 - 5) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 15 = 30

Subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 15

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a car, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the original number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes must be 30 - 5 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She is giving 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 1 * 40 = 40 plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she is giving away from the total number of plants she already has: 80 - 40 = 40.

So, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 

Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. To do this, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 

90 / 30 = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 20 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away, we divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since Julia can't row a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets.

Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it takes 3 sets of 20 feet 3 * 16 = 48 seconds. 

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took on per second. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we divide 2 by 10 to get 0.2 liters per foot. 

Now, we multiply the time it took Julia to row to the shore (48 seconds) by the amount of water taken on per foot (0.2 liters) to get 48 * 0.2 = 9.6 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone. So, we can write the equation:

1800 = 6B

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, we can write the equation:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total costs of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards will be 1.5 times the cost price, and the selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards will be 1.5 times the cost price.

The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

10 boards * $15 per board = $150

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
$16 * 1.5 = $24 per board
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, add the total selling prices of both types of boards:

"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary:
Adrien's current salary = Adrien's old salary + 40% of Adrien's old salary
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $16,000

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 in profit per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   10 elves quit from the 40 remaining, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure, we need to calculate the expenditure for May and June separately and then add them together.

Expenditure in May: $500
Expenditure in June: $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

Now, let's add the total number of tickets used:
12 (Pam's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (Fred's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (their luge tickets) = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28
= 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply by 12.

Number of car washes per month: 4
Cost per car wash: $15
Total cost per month: 4 * $15 = $60
Total cost per year: $60 * 12 = $720

Tom pays $720 in a year."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Scottish unicorns: 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we multiply the total number of unicorns by 1/3.
   Total unicorns = 27
   Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

2. Calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.
   Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

The answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions completed.

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions completed.

To find out the total number of questions completed, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 + 30 = 70 questions completed.

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75 and Mark completed 70, we subtract to find the number of questions left incomplete: 
75 - 70 = 5 questions left incomplete.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs = 4 * 12 = 48

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to the result.

Number of pink gumballs = 48 + 22 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his weekly earnings would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items.

The total cost of the food items is: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Total food cost: $2 + $3 = $5

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. 
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total food cost and the total non-food cost plus the tax:
Total cost = $5 + $10 + $1 = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit = Total income - Total expenses

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of legos Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Johnny picks up 2125 legos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries.
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, the pigeons, the raccoon, and the ants to the remaining fries: 48 (eaten) + 5 (remaining) = 53 fries.

However, we need to account for the fries eaten by the seagull, which is 7 fries. So, the initial number of fries in the pack is 53 + 7 = 60 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.
Converting the total length of the croissants to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. 
She covers 40 yards to the 40-yard line and then 40 yards back to the starting point, so she covers 80 yards per trip. 
80 yards * 34 trips = 2720 yards

Since 2720 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 1220 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can set up an equation. 

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D. We know that D = 3A and R = 4.

We also know that the cost of one red car is $4, so R = 4. 

Now, we can find the cost of an action figure: 
D = 3A
4 = 3A
A = 4/3

Now that we know the cost of an action figure, we can find the cost of the doll:
D = 3A
D = 3 * (4/3)
D = 4

Now, we have the costs of all the toys:
- Red car: $4
- Action figure: $4/3
- Doll: $4

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add their costs:
Total cost = 5 * R + 3 * A + D
Total cost = 5 * 4 + 3 * (4/3) + 4
Total cost = 20 + 4 + 4

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9

Number of babysitting jobs = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of spider legs is 80 * 8 = 640.

Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540.

Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 640 (spider legs) + 540 (insect legs) + 30 (invertebrate legs) = 1210.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first find out how much Jessica wants to pay for each debt. 

For her student loans, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $300. 
50% of $300 is $150, so she wants to pay $300 + $150 = $450 per month.

For her credit card, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $200. 
50% of $200 is $100, so she wants to pay $200 + $100 = $300 per month.

For her mortgage, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $500. 
50% of $500 is $250, so she wants to pay $500 + $250 = $750 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly payments: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500 per month.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000 per year.

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting each potato separately and then add them together.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for peeling and cutting by 60.

Time to peel 60 potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes
Time to cut 60 potatoes: 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds

Converting 300 seconds to minutes: 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate their total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members: 160 - 60 = 100.

Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$.

1. Rent: 1/4 of 6000$ is 600$.
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of 6000$ is 2000$.
3. Total spent so far: 600$ (rent) + 2000$ (car fuel) = 2600$.
4. Remaining amount: 6000$ - 2600$ = 3400$.
5. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 3400$ = 1700$.
6. After donation: 3400$ - 1700$ = 1700$.
7. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on them is 200$ + 700$ = 900$.
8. Final amount left: 1700$ - 900$ = 800$.

The final amount Zaid has left is 800$."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 2, and 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1 - 3/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probability:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: 25%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters: 
10 cages of hamsters * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits: 
20 pieces of straw

Now, let's subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 
160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 
90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 
15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.

Total interest = Interest for one month * Number of months
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

However, this is the total number of bags bought, not sold. Since the trader sold 13 bags, we can confirm that the number of bags bought is indeed 114, but the number of bags sold is 13.

Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year, and then subtract the total number of trees that die after 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so after 10 years, he will have planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so after 10 years, he will have chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After planting 100 trees, he now has 50 + 100 = 150 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.3: 150 * 0.3 = 45.

So, 45 trees die, leaving Tom with 150 - 45 = 105 trees.

There are 40 restaurants, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots in total, we can now calculate the number of pounds that will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120 pounds

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

The monetary reward is $5000, which is a one-time payment. 

The raise in salary is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 
5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

Since the raise is applied to his weekly salary, we need to calculate the new weekly salary after the raise. 
New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the new weekly salary by 52 to get the total yearly salary.
Total yearly salary = $2100 * 52 = $108,000.

Now, we add the monetary reward to the total yearly salary to get the total earnings for the year.
Total earnings = $108,000 + $5000 = $108,500.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

Since there are 6 tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To get the total score of 558, we need to add the required score to 358. 

558 - 358 = 200.

So, Brinley needs a score of 200 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total amount she needs is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4).

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since Sara needs to earn $60 in total, and she can earn $5 per babysitting session, she can earn $5 * 12 = $60 in 12 babysitting sessions. However, she needs 15 lawn mowing sessions to earn the same amount.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 - 12 = 3 more times.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the initial amount of water in the small pool is x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. The amount of water lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is also 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4x gallons. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16.

We know that the current amount of water in the big pool is 4 times the amount of water in the small pool. So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

16 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 8

So, the initial amount of water in the small pool was 8 gallons. Since the small pool lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the small pool is:

8 - 16 = -8 gallons

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:

Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34.
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have been mentioned so far: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time (in hours) = 60 / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial 36 watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate the number of penguins that left the sunbathing area.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

So, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 36 - 24 = 12.

12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices needed as follows:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to John's and James' candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has. 

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, we can compare John's and James' candies. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. 

The difference between John's and James' candies is 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for 'x', we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, let's add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea's fruits = 52 (apples) + 24 (bananas) = 76
Jamal's fruits = 44 (apples) + 48 (bananas) = 92

6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we need to multiply this by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows.

12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

3. Then, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9 cards, which have the letter D.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as 'x' and Marco's current age as 'y'. We know that x + y = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be y + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots is (40 * 70) + (60 * 35) = 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 15 + 30 = 45 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in each necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and then add them together.

In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

Total number of stories written by the three children: 60 + 120 + 180 = 360

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 
40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by their individual weight.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

The landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. 

Since they have 10 times less medals than have been given out, we can set up the equation: 39 = x/10.

To find the total number of medals given out, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10 = 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works and then multiply it by her earnings per minute.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's initial points:
- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim's points: 18 points
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add the points of all three players:

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total cost of driving per day = 60 miles/day * $2/mile = $120/day

Total cost of driving per year = $120/day * 260 days/year (5 days/week * 52 weeks/year) = $31,200/year

Additionally, John gets a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40
   Noah's age six years ago = 40

2. Now, we can calculate Noah's current age:
   Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
   Noah's current age = 40 + 6
   Noah's current age = 46

3. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
   Population of Chile six years ago = 120000

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can calculate the current population of Chile:
   Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

2. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

3. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

4. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 * 0.1
Total Cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26 (total pencils Jam has). 

Now, let's solve for 'x': 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which is a total of 3*8 + 2 = 26 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 26 (Jam's) + 46 (Meg's) = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used:

65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the weakening caused by the added cream. The problem states that adding any liquid weakens the coffee, but it doesn't specify the exact weakening caused by the cream. However, we can assume that the weakening caused by the cream is proportional to the amount of cream added. Since the problem doesn't provide a specific ratio, we can assume that the cream weakens the coffee equally in all cases.

To find the total weakening, we need to add the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the cream. However, since we don't know the exact weakening caused by the cream, we can only calculate the total weakening caused by the cooling:

60 milliliters

Since we can't provide an exact answer without knowing the weakening caused by the cream, we can only provide the weakening caused by the cooling.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of new records the 5 people received. We know that they left with 7 new records.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 old records per person * 5 people = 10 old records

However, we know that the 5 people left with 7 new records, not 10. This means that 3 new records were not accounted for. 

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the 3 unaccounted new records must have come from 1.5 people. However, since you can't trade half a record, this is not possible.

Let's re-examine the situation. If 5 people left with 7 new records, and each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of old records traded must be equal to the total number of new records received.

So, the correct equation is:

2 old records per person * 5 people = 7 new records

2 * 5 = 10

However, we know that 3 new records were not accounted for. This means that the 3 unaccounted new records must have come from 1 person who traded 6 old records for 3 new records.

Now, we can calculate the total number of old records:

5 people * 2 old records per person = 10 old records
1 person * 6 old records = 6 old records

Total old records = 10 + 6 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after subtracting the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 13 - 7 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and received $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they received $80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they received is 4 * 0.5 = 2 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount spent: $80 - $2 = $78.

The customer paid $78 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total tax amount first. 

Total tax for Job A = 20% of $15 * 2000 hours = 0.2 * 15 * 2000 = $6000
Net pay for Job A = $15 * 2000 - $6000 = $30,000

To determine the net pay for Job B, we need to calculate the property tax first. 
Net income for Job B = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax on net income for Job B = 10% of $36,000 = 0.1 * 36,000 = $3600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3600 = $30,600

Since $30,600 is greater than $30,000, Job B has a higher net pay rate. 
The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $30,600 - $30,000 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. 

Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students. 

We are given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, we can set up the equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

So, the smallest group has 105 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. 

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will also need to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the total cost of the activities is $30, and we want to find out how many friends she can invite.

Let's assume the cost per person is x. Then, the total cost of the activities for n friends will be $30n. Since each friend will pay for their own activities, the total cost for n friends will be $30n.

We know that the total budget is $90, and the total cost of the activities is $30n. So, we can set up the equation: $30n = $90 - $60 (the remaining budget after subtracting the cost of the activities).

Simplifying the equation, we get: $30n = $30.
Dividing both sides by $30, we get: n = 1.

However, this doesn't make sense, as Morgan wants to invite friends. Let's re-examine the problem.

The total cost of the activities is $30, and the cost per person is not explicitly stated. However, we can assume that the cost per person is at least $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf). 

Let's recalculate the budget: $90 - $30 (activities) = $60. Since each friend will pay for their own activities, we can divide the remaining budget by the minimum cost per person ($5) to find the maximum number of friends: $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite up to 12 friends.

Final answer: 12"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount of money he had initially ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

Final answer: 5.33"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, let's solve for 'x':

2x - 5 = 45
2x = 50
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 675.

18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

Time taken to drive to his friend's house: 
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken for the detour: 
Distance = 10 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to drive back home: 
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, which is 4 * 3 = 12.
3. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks and shoplifting is 3 + 12 = 15.
4. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which is 3 * 12 = 36.
5. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is 15 + 36 = 51.
6. Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 51 = -1. However, since you can't have a negative number of people, this indicates that the given information is inconsistent."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

So Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4.67
Erin's points before = 14

However, this doesn't make sense, as Erin scored 14 points after scoring 14 points. This means Erin must have had 0 points before scoring 14 points.

The correct answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts:

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame: $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 picture frames: 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5.
   - Total cost for pins: 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords: 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost
Total cost = $320 + $400
Total cost = $720

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $720."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the faulty pieces were returned, we need to subtract them from the total number of pieces to find the number of functioning pieces.

Total number of pieces = 400,000
Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces.

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost per piece
Since the cost per piece is not given, we can assume it's the same for all pieces. 

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 240,000 * (400,000 / 400,000)

First, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 4, which is 12. 

1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, and she eats 2 slices, we need to subtract 2 from 7/12.

To subtract 2 from 7/12, we can convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
2 = 24/12

Now, we subtract:
7/12 - 24/12 = -17/12

Since we can't have a negative number of slices, we can convert -17/12 to a mixed number:

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

In 30 days, the total energy usage would be 7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert the total energy usage to kilowatts by dividing by 1000:

216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage would be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

In 30 days, the new total energy usage would be 2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new energy usage:

216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh

Converting this to kilowatts, we get:

135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

Final answer: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:

- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Total cost = $35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

The final answer is: $50."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 640 hours
Total amount paid in May = 640 hours * $15/hour = $9600

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.
Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 480 hours
Total amount paid in June = 480 hours * $15/hour = $7200

Total amount paid in the two months = $9600 + $7200 = $16800

The final answer is: 16800"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. To find the answer, we would need more information about the relationship between the two defects.

However, assuming that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 x 50000
= 2500

So, 2500 candles smell like wet dog. If we assume that this is also the percentage that explode, then:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 x 50000
= 2500

Therefore, 2500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price.
Discounted price = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine the constants:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

So, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 380"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2c + d = 304. 

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as c + d = 180.

Now, we have two equations:

1) 2c + d = 304
2) c + d = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'd':

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute 'c' into one of the original equations to find 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the initial elevation of Stanley (10,000 feet) to the distance the comb fell (4,000 feet). 

10,000 feet (Stanley's initial elevation) + 4,000 feet (distance the comb fell) = 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb (14,000 feet) and Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet). 

14,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 11,000 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. The initial number of cats was 50. After 20 cats were carried away, the remaining number of cats is 50 - 20 = 30.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total savings from the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the total savings from the jogger jeans is 3 times the savings from the tattered jeans. 

The total savings from the jogger jeans is $6. Since this is 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the total savings from the jogger jeans is 3 times the savings from the tattered jeans. 

Let's denote the savings from the tattered jeans as x. Then, the total savings from the jogger jeans is 3x. We know that the total savings from the jogger jeans is $6, so 3x = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 2. This means the savings from the tattered jeans is $2. 

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 and Cole saved $2, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $2 = $30.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the original price of the jogger jeans is $30 - $6 = $24.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he's going to the amusement park, that means he has $50 from the sale of his cards.

We know that he sells the cards for $1.5 each and he keeps 1/3 of them. This means he sells 2/3 of his cards. Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as 'x'. 

Since he sells 2/3 of his cards for $1.5 each, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5.

We know that this amount is equal to $50 (the amount he has after selling the cards). So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to get:

x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs per guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, we can see that there is a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 99% of his money was spent. We know that he spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. So, 99% of 500 cents is 0.99 * 500 = 495 cents.

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent. 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars bought. 375 / 75 = 5.

The total cost of the ingredients: $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00

Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 
The cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

The total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then find out how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 x 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since Bernadette can't leave a negative time, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

If Bernadette leaves 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she will arrive 11 minutes after Wayne. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads the sister with fewer beads has from the number of beads the sister with more beads has. 

Since Elizabeth has fewer beads, we subtract her beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect of the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking:
Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect of the open window:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes = 0.2 degrees/minute
Cooling time = 30 minutes
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 + 15 = 55 degrees
Temperature after cooling = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

Final temperature = 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40)
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We also know that James won by 10 minutes, so we can set up an equation to find James' run time.
James' total time = Jon's total time - 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 - 10
James' total time = 160 minutes

James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
160 = 36 + 85 + James' run time
James' run time = 160 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 39 minutes

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance it runs in 30 minutes as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours
Distance = 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for 16 miles is:

Cost of hay = 16 * 0.5 * $3 = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
$5 * 6 = $30

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money he has:
Change = $30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so we need to divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each:
48 sneakers - 17 sneakers = 31 sneakers
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the colors from both types of packets.

Six packets had 8 colors each, so 6 * 8 = 48 colors.
Four packets had 16 colors each, so 4 * 16 = 64 colors.

Now, we add the colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2 by not buying it. So, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $2 = $18.

2. The cost of the popcorn and soda together is $1 extra when you buy the super ticket. Since you didn't buy the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn and soda together is $1.

3. The cost of the soda is $3. To find the cost of the popcorn, subtract the cost of the soda from the total cost of the popcorn and soda: $1 - $3 = -$2. However, since we can't have a negative cost, this means the cost of the popcorn is actually $3 - $1 = $2.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the original cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase: 
$65 * 170 = $11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as:
Volume = Length * Width * Height
Volume = 8 feet * 2 feet * 2 feet
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2
Number of bags = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12
Total cost = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

60% of 15 red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Since the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors:
Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 24
Number of yellow cards = 39
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies from both dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
4400 / 2250 = 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians. 

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:
Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = 2/3 * 27 = 18

Now, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. 
Girl Pomeranians = 1/3 * 18 = 6

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

Highest temperature in Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
Highest temperature in Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
Highest temperature in Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

Remaining amount = Total cost of the toy - Amount he already has
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount to find out how many days it will take.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

The child will take 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Total number of eggs = 64
Total capacity of trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Number of eggs that won't be placed = Total number of eggs - Total capacity of trays
= 64 - 48
= 16

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors and then apply the discount.

Each pack costs $4.00, and there's a buy one get one free deal, so for 2 packs, Heather will pay for 1 pack and get the second one free. 

The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon. The total cost after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather is getting 2 packs for $2.00, we need to divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each individual razor. 

$2.00 / 2 = $1.00 per pack.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, we need to multiply the cost per pack by 4 to find the cost of each individual razor.

$1.00 * 4 = $4.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$4.00 * 100 = 400 cents

The final answer is 400."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 * (64"" + 60"") = 3 * 124"" = 372"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 * (64"" + 60"") = 2 * 124"" = 248"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 372"" + 248"" = 876"".

To convert inches to feet, we divide the total height by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 876"" / 12 = 73 feet.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the total minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the number of times she got up and walked in 5 days.

Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours a day, she will get up and walk 8 times a day. 

In 5 days, she will get up and walk 8 * 5 = 40 times.

Since each time she walks for 5 minutes, the total minutes she walked is 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

"To find the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they brought 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Now that we know David found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first calculate the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber to save money.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks he can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep in each location and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the total number of animals in the farm and zoo:
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 120."

"To calculate the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to determine how many days he has to reach his goal. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days. 

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days: 
105,000 calories / 181 days ≈ 578 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 578 calories to reach his goal."

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:
Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors:
Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

Since the boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 20 kids in total, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 20 * 60 = 1200 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 1200 + 4 * 60 = 1200 + 240 = 1440 shells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we can divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

1440 / 10 = 144 shells per girl.

The final answer is: 144"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. 

Since George had twice as many candies as Nick initially, we can represent the initial number of candies George had as 2x, where x is the number of candies Nick had. 

We know that after eating 5 candies, George had 3 left, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 5 = 3.

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 8, x = 4.

So, Nick initially had 4 candies. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Number of vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

Final answer: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's assume Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is $100, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:
5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, in total, 3 (initial) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For sales over $1000, the additional commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is:
$2500 - $1000 = $1500
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to get Antonella's total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3:
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time for 1 mile on a hot day:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time for 1 mile on a hot day by 3 to find the time for 3 miles:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the final angle.

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we subtract the angle moved by the sun from the initial angle:
32 - 50 = -18 degrees

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle:
-18 + 360 = 342 degrees

However, this is the angle relative to the ground. We need to find the angle from the ground to the sun. Since the sun is initially at the tip of the pyramid, the angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the initial angle, which is 32 degrees.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 32 degrees.

"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son is 8 years old, so he will need 8 candles. 

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to follow the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
3. Richie scored 80 goals.

Let's start by finding out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can subtract 20 from Richie's total goals to find Mark's total goals:
Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can subtract 45 from Richie's total goals to find Anna's total goals:
Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals each teenager scored, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

520 * 1.04 = 540

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200

The combined value of the two houses is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we'll calculate 10% of $100 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10
Discounted price = $100 - $10 = $90

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be:
2 * $90 = $180

Now, we need to find the cost of each pair of contacts. Since 90 single-use contacts come in 1 box, and Pete will get 90 contacts from 2 boxes, we can divide the total cost by 90 to find the cost per pair.

Cost per pair = $180 / 90 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 words, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM.
Then, he increases his speed by 5 words again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57 WPM. 
To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' spouses, and the number of people she directly invited.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of additional guests is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends' friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than Mark's window height of 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, we can multiply this value by the amount of mushrooms John eats per day (200 grams) to find the amount of protein he gets per day:

0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms * 200 grams of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to find the weekly amount:

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69.

The final answer is 69."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tires will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The original price of the shorts is $35. 
Price of the shorts after discount = $35

Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit including sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4 pound:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

Total number of times both DVDs can be played: 644 + 865 = 1509

The final answer is: 1509"
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, so the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions.

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

1. At school: 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum
2. On the way home from school: 1 piece
3. After dinner: 1 piece
4. Total pieces chewed: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces Jim has initially: 20 pieces

Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so we need to find half of 20: 20 / 2 = 10

Now, subtract the pieces chewed from the initial amount and then subtract the pieces given to his sister: 20 - 6 - 10 = 4

Jim has 4 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

Now, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. 
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both periods:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's calculate the difference:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate:
8 / 2 = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright as follows:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, the price of a silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we can add up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, let's add the costs together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary will be: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley:
Total distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total distance = 79 miles

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost for her was:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for her was:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the final price paid by Clara is lower than Sheila's, the correct answer is -$142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month.

In the first month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half of her sales from green hats. So, her sales from green hats in the first month were 2 * $400 = $800.

Total sales in the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
3/4 * $1200 = $900.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 * $10,000 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the time it took to cook rice as R, the time to cook pork as P, and the time to cook beans as B.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so R = 30.

We also know that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50.

We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so B = (P + R) / 2 = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40.

Now, we need to find the total time it took to cook all the food. The total time is the sum of the time it took to cook each food item: Total time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they share equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have $120.

120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes. 

Adding the extra 5 minutes, the total game length is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the number of management employees first. 

20% of 50 employees are management, so we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is 20% in decimal form):
50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, out of these 10 management employees, 30% oversee the entire company. We multiply 10 by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form):
10 * 0.3 = 3

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

"To find out how much candy each person would have, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 
Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we divide the total amount by 3 (the number of people).
12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds per person.

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and 10 neutral days in the first 30 days. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in the month. 
12 (good days) + 8 (bad days) + 10 (neutral days) = 30 days

Since the first 30 days are already accounted for, the next 3 days are also part of the month. 

The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. 
So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (good days in the next 3 days) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 good days left in the month.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for 'x':

2x + 3 = 21
2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18
x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. The difference between 600 and 240 is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the total inches needed (360) by the daily growth rate (30) to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

360 / 30 = 12

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. Since James bought toys for the 12 dogs, he now has 12 toys.
4. When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. However, 3 dogs were gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs left.
6. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we calculate 2/5 of $1200.
   2/5 * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.
   1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We calculate 2/3 of 720.
   2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested.
   720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

Number of hash browns per 6 potatoes = 36
Number of potatoes = 96

To find the number of hash browns per potato, we divide 36 by 6:
36 ÷ 6 = 6

Now, we multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes:
6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up all the cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 
68 + 5 = 73 cookies for Max.

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 
73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now, we have the number of cookies for all three: 
- Katarina: 68
- Max: 73
- Cookie Monster: 61

To find the total number of cookies, we add them up: 
68 + 73 + 61 = 202

The total number of cookies is 202."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Time spent walking so far
Time left to get to school = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, the ages of the twins are x and x + 7 (the older twin). The ages of the triplets are x, x, and x + 7.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can write the equation as:

x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger twin, the age of the older twin is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The final answer is 7.67."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time: 
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap before dinner."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10: 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4): 
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: 
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the number of years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have together, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved. 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the total bill includes the cost of vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check, we can set up the equation:
0.6x = $40 + x

To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides:
0.6x - x = $40
-0.4x = $40
Divide both sides by -0.4:
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find out how much John leaves with:
$125 (initial amount) - $100 (total bill) = $25

John leaves with $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city and the number of fireworks set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city:
15 boxes of 20 fireworks each = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks set off in her backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 12 friends initially, and 7 more friends join them, making a total of 19 people. Since each person has a seat, 19 seats are needed. 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks needed is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks. 
The total number of snacks needed is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.
Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. 
After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces.
After two weeks, Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's amount from Amy's amount: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet.

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store would be 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound = $75.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

Last week: 4 boxes

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4

Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the number of minutes.

Scenario 1: Both hands at her sides
- Right foot: 300 taps/minute
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute
- Combined taps/minute: 300 + 250 = 550 taps/minute

Scenario 2: Arms raised
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute
- Combined taps/minute: 200 + 200 = 400 taps/minute

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. So, the number of taps for the first 2 minutes is:
- 2 minutes * 400 taps/minute = 800 taps

The remaining 3 minutes are with her arms at her sides:
- 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

Total taps = 800 + 1650 = 2450 taps

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450.
The cost of fixing the pothole himself is the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket) plus the fine he would receive from the city council ($120). 
So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is 3 * $25 + $120 = $95.

Now, let's subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to find out how much money Ron saves:
$450 - $95 = $355

Ron saves $355 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 80 + 18 = 98 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 98 = -38. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this means that the friends ate more slices than the total number of slices available. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and the two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, we can assume that the 2/3 and ¾ are fractions of the total pizza, not the individual pizzas. 

Let's assume the total pizza is 1 whole pizza. Then, 2/3 of the pizza is 2/3, and ¾ of the pizza is 3/4. Since 2/3 + 3/4 = 11/12, which is less than 1, this is a valid assumption.

Now, let's recalculate the slices eaten: 
Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of the pizza, which is 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices.
The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of the pizza, which is 3/4 x 12 = 9 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 
The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we have the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages (20 minutes) and the time it takes for the cat to eat the sausages (30 minutes). 

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2. 
Average time = (20 + 30) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10, so candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100, and candidate A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
So, candidate C got 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has initially, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck initially has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount. 
90 - 87 = 3

Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has: 
20 / 2 = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total: 
10 + 6 = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's total from Clara's total: 
20 - 16 = 4

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98"
"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 + 5 = 15 students like to bake or play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - 15 = 35.

Since 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To find the total cost of the first amusement park, we need to multiply the number of adults by the adult fee and the number of children by the child fee, then add the two amounts together.

For the first amusement park: 
Adults: 2 * $26 = $52
Children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
Adults: 2 * $14 = $28
Children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

However, the question states that 12 groups are required. To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the required number of groups.

Number of groups needed = Total students / Required number of groups
Number of groups needed = 54 / 12
Number of groups needed = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of more groups needed, not the total number of groups. 

To find the number of more groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already available from the required number of groups.

Number of more groups needed = Required number of groups - Number of groups available
Number of more groups needed = 12 - 6
Number of more groups needed = 6

"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 days.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 60 * 20 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 days.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 100 * 8 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 (weekdays) + 800 (weekends) = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to first determine the number of votes against it. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, we can represent the number of votes against as 'x'. 

The number of votes in favor would then be 2x. 

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x (the number of votes against) is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
   1/3 * 600 = 200 movies in series.

2. The cost of these series is 6 times the cost of a normal movie, which is 6 * $10 = $60.

3. Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total:
   600 - 200 = 400 movies.

4. Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 mph). We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance.

Distance = 20 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 (enemies) + 8 (berries) + 26 (time) = 34 points.

Ava's score: 
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She collects 8 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 3 = 5 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 8 (enemies) + 5 (berries) + 30 (time) = 43 points.

The difference between their scores is 43 - 34 = 9 points.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2.

34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange, but a mix of both colors. Let's say the number of orange fish taken out is x, and the number of white fish taken out is 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) = 4 - 17 + x = -13 + x white fish.

We are told that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(-13 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = -26 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 + 26 = 2x + x

29 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 29/3

x = 9.67 (round down to 9, since you can't have a fraction of a fish)

So, the number of orange fish taken out is 9.

Now, we can find the number of white fish taken out:

17 - x = 17 - 9 = 8

Therefore, Bob bought 8 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the total amount of money Andy's car consumes per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles per week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week by dividing the total miles driven by the fuel efficiency:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 25 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 2.5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total cost of gas consumed per week by multiplying the gas consumed per week by the price of gas:

Total cost per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Total cost per week = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Total cost per week = $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

She spent 6 twenties, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 twenties left.

Carrie was given 140 quarters. She spent all of them.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent:
- 6 twenties = 6 * 20 = 120 dollars
- 140 quarters = 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars

Total amount spent = 120 + 35 = 155 dollars

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and the temperature at night is 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train becomes 125 + 13 = 138.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total employees after 3 months = 260
Total amount paid per month = 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

Total amount paid in 3 months = $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.00 * 20 = $220.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$230 - $220 = $10.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives us:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives us:

x = 6

So Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

For third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

For fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.

For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth graders', so it's 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
Third graders: 340
Fourth graders: 40
Fifth graders: 2 * 40 = 80
Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 900

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Total students who passed: 460
Total students in the school: 900
Overall pass rate: 460/900 = 0.51 or 51%

The school's overall pass rate is 51%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 
72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 
6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length:

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Total marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3
Total marshmallows left in the bag = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jack played for 4/60 = 1/15 hours.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they played for 20/2 = 10 minutes or 1/6 hours.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so they played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes or 1/2 hour.

Now, let's calculate the total time played by each person in hours:
- Jack: 1/15 hours
- Friend 1: 1/6 hours
- Friend 2: 1/2 hours

Total time played is 1/15 + 1/6 + 1/2 = (4 + 5 + 15)/30 = 24/30 = 4/5 hours.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total cost is 4/5 * 25 cents = 20 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide 10 by 3:
O = 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of cards each person has. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

Time spent on TikTok videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes per week
Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week = 120 minutes/week
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week

Total time spent on TikTok per week: 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

So, Britany spends approximately 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. 
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items. 
The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance traveled by the kangaroos is the same as the distance traveled by the turtles. We can set up an equation using the speed of the kangaroo and the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 108 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 27 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4.

Time = 27 hours * 4
Time = 108 hours

So, it will take 108 hours for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by all three: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as 'x'. We know that the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $50, so we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Now, subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current 3 cows produce.

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer wants 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce the remaining amount.

25 liters (target) - 15 liters (current) = 10 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount each cow produces:

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 millimeters.
The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

To find the total number of dishes, we know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.

Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Total infected = 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Therefore, after three days, 490 people are infected.

"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we need to calculate the amount of tips each received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which is 90% of Rafaela's tips. 90% of $800 is 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 2 * 3 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son, so she gave away a total of 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) 
Total coins = 110

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
Total burritos eaten = 20 burritos.

Now, we subtract the total burritos eaten from the total burritos given to the students to find the leftover burritos.
Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 burritos - 20 burritos
Total leftover burritos = 480 burritos.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
= 75 - 52
= 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the amount Keenan pays by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he wants to make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much he paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($11000) by the number of chickens he plans to sell (180):

$11000 / 180 chickens = $61.11 per chicken

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."

"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's say in x years, her age will be thrice her present age. 

So, her age in x years will be 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since her current age is 8 years, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to become 24 years.

65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys: 200
Toys given away: 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now: 200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so together that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) + 250 (Fridays) = 500 chimichangas.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be paired. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones is x. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, 80% of the microphones can be paired. 

We know that the total number of microphones is 50. So, 80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2 to get the number of pairs: 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead: 
2/3 of 6 birds = (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds

Next, let's find the total number of birds in the groups: 
3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, let's add the birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the groups together: 
6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in the groups) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide 50 by 5.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 
5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 
4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference:
40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we multiply 100 by 1/4, which equals 25. 

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants: 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. We multiply 75 by 2/3, which equals 50.

The remaining plants are flowering plants. We subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the speed of the thingamabob first. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit would be 11x.

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. 

Speed of whirligig = 5 * speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We can subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

$11 (total) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2.

$2 / 2 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = $12 per hour * 8 hours per day * 5 days per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + (3 * 6) + (5 * 6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
Number of rentals per month: 10
Hours per rental: 3
Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Hourly wage: $25
Total monthly income: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
Car payment: $500
Total monthly income: $750
Profit: $750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks. However, since you can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number:

12 - 2 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis' distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:
Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 8 bowls (since it can fill 4 adult bowls). 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 5 people. Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, we can divide 8 by 5 to find out how many bowls each person can have for dinner. 

8 / 5 = 1.6 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 1 bowl per person for dinner. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls are left for lunch. 

5 people had 1 bowl each for dinner, so 5 bowls were used. 

8 - 5 = 3 bowls are left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the remaining 3 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

3 / 2 = 1.5 

Again, we can't have a fraction of a bowl, so we'll round down to 1 bowl per child for lunch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

William spent $8 in total."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks.

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, 3 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks.

Now, let's calculate the total material needed:
5 sets of 2 yards for small masks = 5 * 2 = 10 yards
3 sets of 2.25 yards for large masks = 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards
Total material needed = 10 + 6.75 = 16.75 yards

The final answer is: 16.75"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets per movie = 27 tickets

= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we subtract the number used from the total number of blue shoe boxes: 
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes used.

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

4"
"To find the number of books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from 18. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total marbles Dean had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that would be 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the size of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres the two farms have together is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles of water: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle of water, we can round down to 7 bottles.

Final answer: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 * 20 (bologna thrown at red balloons) + 3 * x (bologna thrown at yellow balloons) = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3x = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

So, Benny threw 6 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the number of yellow balloons is:

20 (red balloons) + 6 (yellow balloons) = 26

Therefore, there are 26 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours worked by Bruce in the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day:
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

The total hours worked by Bruce in the three days is 23."
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cake costs $11.
1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, so 1 balloon costs $0.25. Since they bought 12 balloons, the total cost of balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 each, so the total cost of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them had initially. 

$28 / 2 = $14.

Since they spent $28 in total, their mother gave them $28 each.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has:

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Since the loaf has 24 slices, we can divide 24 by 6 to find out how many days it will last:

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60.

60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the amount of water in the tank, we first need to calculate half the amount of water in the pool. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since they are filling the tank with water from the pool, the tank initially has 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

To find the amount of water remaining after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount.

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

However, Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he can only see 13 - 5 = 8 more movies."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

Total number of toys initially = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Total number of toys now = 62

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total number of toys initially
= 62 - 48
= 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, and Maria had 1 balloon. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
4 friends * 2 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the number of boxes donated by the people and the number of boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we need to subtract the existing tables from the total number of tables needed.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The cost of these additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of pencils from his remaining money:
250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have:
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts:

1. Labor cost: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75
2. Parts cost: $60
3. Total cost = Labor cost + Parts cost = $78.75 + $60 = $138.75
4. Add the initial visit charge: $138.75 + $40 = $178.75

The total amount Patty charged is $178.75."
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original cost of the CDs. 

The original cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the cost of the CDs after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the cost of the CDs after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how far James swims in the first part of his journey. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate it as follows:
   Distance swum = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

2. Now, we need to find out how long it took James to swim 12 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour:
   Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours

3. After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, the resting time is:
   Resting time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

4. Now, we need to find out how far James has to swim in the remaining part of his journey. Since he has already swum 12 miles, the remaining distance is:
   Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

5. In the remaining part of his journey, James swims at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. So, the time taken to swim the remaining distance is:
   Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours

6. Now, we can find the total time taken by adding the swimming time, resting time, and time taken to swim the remaining distance:
   Total time taken = Swimming time + Resting time + Time taken to swim the remaining distance
   Total time taken = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She started with 15 stickers.
2. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up the equation: 
Marcus' age = 0.5 * Leo's age
21 = 0.5 * Leo's age
Leo's age = 21 / 0.5
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.

Now that we know Dinar scored 5 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
Azibo scored x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is: 15"

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so she woke up at 11:55 p.m.

She also sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep:
- Time from 10 p.m. to 11:55 p.m. = 1 hour 55 minutes = 115 minutes
- Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
- Total time = 115 minutes + 23 minutes = 138 minutes

However, we need to subtract the 5 minutes she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to the number of cups. One dozen is 12, so two dozen is 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups.

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

"To find the total number of occupied beds, we first need to find the number of occupied beds initially. 

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, we multiply the total capacity by 1/5:
1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Now, we need to find the total number of days in 2 weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:
200 + 700 = 900 beds

Since the total capacity is 1000 beds, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

   Non-work emails = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails = 9

2. Now, we find out how many of these non-work emails are to family.
   Emails to family = 2/3 of non-work emails
   Emails to family = (2/3) * 9
   Emails to family = 6

3. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 of non-work emails
   Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * 9
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then multiply it by 3. 

Aliya is 3 years old. 
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of balls that Jeffrey picked up and carried. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation: 
Jason's balls = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
2 = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up another equation:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

Now, we know that the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339
Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360
Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first leg and then a northerly direction for the second leg, and finally a southerly direction for the third leg, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.
2. Calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.
3. Calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 240 / 4 = 60 oranges.
4. Calculate the number of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister: 240 - 40 = 200 oranges.
5. Calculate the number of oranges she sold: 200 oranges.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Half of 50 is 25. 
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we can divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and we have already accounted for 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the total number of cherries accounted for from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday = 15
Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days. 

Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday = 10
Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday = 10 * $6 = $60
Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday = 15 * $6 = $90
Earnings from apple pie on Saturday = 11 * $15 = $165
Earnings from apple pie on Sunday = 15 * $15 = $225

Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225
Total earnings for Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 
30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 
6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space each plant occupies: 
12 inches (plant width) + 1.5 feet (space between) * 12 inches/foot = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant occupies: 
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be: 
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate Edgar's brother's daily pretzel intake as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses = 30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = $500 / $1,000 = 0.5

So, Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes per year.

Final answer: 0.5"
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

2. The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. It ran on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

3. The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was off for 2 hours, so it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

4. The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling and warming effects: 6 - 12 - 4 = -10 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 1 = 75 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill was born as 90 - 75 = 15 years.

Now, we know that Bill was x years old when he saw the comet for the first time, and 15 years have passed since then. So, we can set up the equation: x + 15 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 90 - 15 = 75.

Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can now write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.
8. Solving for W, we get: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far.

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we can assume that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far. 

So, Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the amount Walter has collected so far, which is $2000. 

The amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The total number of slices is 6, and the number of slices for the adults is 4. 

To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (number of slices for adults / total number of slices) * 100
= (4 / 6) * 100
= 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00"
"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by both Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold and multiply it by the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total, we can set up the equation: 8x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25 per session, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons. However, since the question asks for the expected earnings, we assume that the studio is not paying any other expenses. Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

480"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box. 
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.

Given the dimensions of the pool: 
- Length (L) = 25 feet
- Width (W) = 14 feet
- Height (H) = 4 feet

Volume (V) = L x W x H
V = 25 x 14 x 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons:
1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed:
10480 gallons x 5.9 = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons needed by the cost per gallon:
61920 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $6192

The cost to fill the pool will be $6192."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

Number of red sticks = 9
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14

"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the number of hours they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old: 
Half of 3000 students are over 16 years old, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so 1500 / 4 = 375 male students are over 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old: 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students are over 16 years old.

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old: 
The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male, so 1500 / 2 = 750 male students are under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old: 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students are under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old: 
1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
34% = 28% + x
x = 6%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 6%."
"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly income and then determine how many weeks it will take her to save 20% of the car's price.

First, let's calculate her total weekly income:
- Wages: 40 hours/week * $10/hour = $400/week
- Tips: 40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week
- Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment:
- 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the total amount she needs to save by her total weekly income:
- $2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages James read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

60"
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the remaining number of guests is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. If we denote the price of a small stuffed animal as P, then the price of a large stuffed animal is 3P.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so P = $4.

Now, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

We also know that the total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned is the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is 3P and the price of a small stuffed animal is P, the total amount earned can be represented as:

3P * L + P * S = 120

Substituting S = 2L and P = $4, we get:

3 * 4 * L + 4 * 2L = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

S = 2L
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by Smith twins = 30
Eggs not found = 10

Eggs found by friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by Smith twins - Eggs not found
= 100 - 30 - 10
= 60

The friends found 60 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches will be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the remaining red balloons:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:
   Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons were released.

4. Calculate the remaining yellow balloons:
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons Sally found:
   8 blue balloons.

6. Calculate the number of blue balloons she added to her clutch:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

80%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium beans as follows:

Number of medium beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can calculate the number of small beans as follows:

Number of small beans = Number of medium beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years Jim spent in college (4 years) by his annual income before college ($25,000). 

$25,000 * 4 years = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned while in college. 

$50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

To find out how much he needs to earn to pay off the loans and the lost income, we need to add the total amount of money lost and the total amount of money he earned while in college.

$100,000 (lost income) + $200,000 (earned income) = $300,000

Since Jim earns $75,000 per year after college, we can divide the total amount he needs to earn ($300,000) by his new income ($75,000) to find out how many years it would take him to pay off the loans and the lost income.

$300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years

"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. So, the total becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. 

Since each tile is 1ft in length and the floor area is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the floor area by the area of a single tile. However, since the tiles are square, we need to square the length of the tile to get the area of a single tile. 

Area of a single tile = 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt

Now, we can calculate the total number of tiles required:
Total tiles = Total floor area / Area of a single tile
Total tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total tiles = 200

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the tiles:
Total cost = Total tiles * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

Yearly cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
So, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from the three years: 100 (two years ago) + 150 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (60 grams).

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2.

Silvia's slices = Jake's slices * 2
Silvia's slices = 7 * 2
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time Betsy spent on her part, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can represent Betsy's part as 'x + 18'. The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the visit: 
   - The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

2. The cost of the cast: $200.

3. The cost of the painkillers: 
   - The doctor charges $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

4. The cost of the parking: 
   - The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of the parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the number of emails that require a response.

Number of emails per day that require a response = 80 - 20% of 80
= 80 - 0.2 * 80
= 80 - 16
= 64

Now, we multiply this number by 5 to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week:
64 * 5 = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we first need to calculate the total number of pounds of butter he needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, the price of 2 pounds of butter will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. 

To find the cost of 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the cost of 3 pairs of 2 pounds of butter. The cost of 3 pairs of 2 pounds of butter will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first calculate how much money they initially had.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she spent 1/4 of her total money. Let's call her total money 'x'. Then, the amount she spent is x/4.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent 1/3 of her total money. Let's call her total money 'y'. Then, the amount she spent is y/3.

We know that Maggie and Riza each had $60. So, we can set up the following equations:

x/4 = 60
y/3 = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the denominator:

x = 60 * 4
x = 240

y = 60 * 3
y = 180

Now that we know Maggie and Riza initially had $240 and $180, respectively, we can find out how much money they have left.

Maggie spent x/4 = 240/4 = 60 dollars, so she has 240 - 60 = 180 dollars left.

Riza spent y/3 = 180/3 = 60 dollars, so she has 180 - 60 = 120 dollars left.

The total amount of money they have left is 180 + 120 = 300 dollars.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
- 15 roses cost $2 each, so 15 * $2 = $30
- A dozen roses cost $15, but Jenny bought 15 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 extra roses. The cost of the extra 3 roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
- Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
- Jenny has 5 * $5 = $25
- Total cost of roses = $36
- Change = $25 - $36 = -$11 (Jenny is short $11)

Since Jenny is short $11, she won't be able to pay with the $5 bills. However, we can calculate how many quarters she would need to pay the remaining amount:
- $11 / $0.25 = 44 quarters

Since Jenny is short $11, she won't have enough quarters to pay the remaining amount. She will have to pay the florist with the $5 bills and the remaining amount will be $11."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. 

To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Selling price = $3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we are looking for the discount percentage, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount percentage = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Discount percentage = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Discount percentage = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the selling price is higher than the original price, which means there is no discount. However, the question asks for the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price. Since the selling price is higher than the original price, the discount percentage is actually the percentage decrease from the original price to the selling price.

Discount percentage = (Original price - Selling price) / Original price * 100
Discount percentage = ($2666.67 - $3200) / $2666.67 * 100
Discount percentage = -20%

The correct answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and back, the total time it took him to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved would be the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week.

Number of classes per week: 5 days * 2 classes/day = 10 classes
Total minutes per class: 40 minutes
Total minutes per week: 10 classes * 40 minutes/class = 400 minutes

Since John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes spent on these days.

Extra learning time per day: 1/16 * 24 hours/day = 1.5 minutes
Total extra learning time per week: 2 days * 1.5 minutes/day = 3 minutes

Now, we add the total minutes spent in classes and the extra learning time to get the total minutes spent learning per week.

Total minutes per week: 400 minutes + 3 minutes = 403 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total hours per week: 403 minutes / 60 = 6.72 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms.

Now, we know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate 135 kilograms. To find the amount left after the T-Rex ate, we add 270 + 135 = 405 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, we can say that the T-Rex ate 405 / 2 = 202.5 kilograms.

Now, to find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 405 + 202.5 = 607.5 kilograms.

The final answer is: 607.5"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 unshaken sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken soda and 0 unshaken sodas.

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left, and Ellen's friend can take it. The probability of Ellen's friend getting the shaken soda is 1 out of the remaining 3 sodas (1 shaken + 2 unshaken).

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people
Number of people in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Total number of people: 420 people (in buses) + 60 people (in cars) = 480 people

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the information given:

1. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. 
   Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
   Martha's age = 24 - 4
   Martha's age = 20

2. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
   Jeff's age = 20 + 10
   Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day, we need to multiply it by the number of days.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the items after the discounts to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. We know that the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and then divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Lauren wants to save for 20 years. To find out how much she needs to save, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Now, we divide the total amount she needs to save ($1,200,000) by her annual savings ($60,000) to find out how many years she needs to work: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

However, since she already has 0 years of work experience, we need to add the 20 years she wants to work to the 20 years she needs to save. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 + 20 = 40 years.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to first find the total number of boys and then divide it by 0.4 (since 40% of the population is boys).

Number of boys = 240
Number of boys as a percentage of the total population = 40%
To find the total population, we can set up the equation:
40% of x = 240
0.4x = 240
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

Final answer: 360"

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we need to calculate the total number of days in June and then divide the total miles she wants to hike by the number of days.

June has 30 days. 

Total miles Soledad wants to hike: 9,300 miles
Total days in June: 30 days

To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the total days:
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:
310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

Total amount received: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person will get, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we will assume it's a typo and the question is actually asking about Pierre and Paul. 

So, Pierre and Paul together will have 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The amount left for Jacques is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount of money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so the total amount spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

Since Anna bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is 5."

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide 255 by 5:
255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing 459 by the rate per minute (51):
459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 400 toys were ordered, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 220 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of both Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know A = 9 as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply 25 boxes by 8 ounces to get 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 200 ounces by 16 to get 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds. The total weight of the boxes is also 200 ounces, which is 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the sidewalk and beach. 
Time on sidewalk = 20 minutes
Time on beach = 40 minutes
Total time = 20 + 40 = 60 minutes

Since the total distance is 3 miles, and we know the time spent on the sidewalk and beach, we can find the time spent on the beach. 
Time spent on beach = 40 minutes
Time spent on sidewalk = 20 minutes
Time spent on the remaining 1 mile = 60 minutes

Now, we can find the time spent on the remaining 1 mile. 
Time spent on 1 mile = 60 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk. 
Time spent on 2 miles on the beach = 40 minutes
Time spent on 1 mile on the sidewalk = 20 minutes
Time spent on 1 mile on the remaining path = 60 minutes

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount of $28. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the amount of water in the second mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is x degrees. We also know that the temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, we can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means that the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is y degrees. We know that the amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce, and the amount of water in the first mug is 4 ounces.

We can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * y) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

y = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try again. We know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is at least 40 degrees. We also know that the amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce, and the amount of water in the first mug is 4 ounces.

We can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * 40 degrees) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 132 = 5

This equation is not true, so the temperature of the second mug cannot be 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks will have 21 days (3 * 7).

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 * 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the total parts in the ratio is 14. 

To find the value of 1 part, we divide the total number of passengers by the total parts in the ratio:

Now, we multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts for women (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus: 
9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who remained on the bus: 
54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold.

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * $5 = $500.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 100 rocks, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks.

The total amount he earns from selling 60 rocks at $7 each is 60 * $7 = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Adam loses:
The amount he loses is the difference between the total cost and the total amount he earns: $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 
Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can find out how many Carrey collected by dividing 22 by 2. 
Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we know that the total number of seashells is 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide them equally, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:
60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:
Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device = 2 * $20 = $40
The total selling price of 6 devices = 6 * $40 = $240

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, they don't need to produce any more bottles to meet the demand.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearing babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearing babies with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple-wearing babies with bows and the blue-wearing babies with bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue-wearing babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 x $3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 in total.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

Adding the 1000 fruits produced in the 10th year, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 53000

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Substituting the expression for B into the equation for R, we get R = 4(Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R into this equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y + 4Y - 7 - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

To find out how much money Rissa gave to her sister, we can calculate 1/5 of $15, which is 15/5 = $3.

Now, we know that Rissa gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with 15 - 3 = $12.

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money, but the problem doesn't mention Ronnie giving any money to her sister. Therefore, Ronnie still has the $5 she was given initially.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as 'x'. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, the new box will have 20% more pods, which is 100 + (100 * 0.2) = 120 pods.

The cost of the new box is $12, so the cost per pod is $12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. To do this, we divide $1 by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.1 = 10.

So, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the original 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

20% of 2.25 = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 0.45 inches.

0.45 / 0.20 = 2.25

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, we need to add 1 day to the result.

x = 2.25 + 1 = 3.25

So, the teacher will have 3.25 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets by 100 to find the total number of books:

54 sets × 100 books/set = 5400 books

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

6 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 14 pizzas

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was x. Then, John's age at that time would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (current age - x) = 28

Since we don't know the current age, let's assume the time passed since Digimon's release is y years. Then, John's current age would be 2x + y, and Jim's current age would be x + y.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + y = 28

We also know that John is 28 now, and we can set up the equation:

2x + y = 28

However, we need another equation to solve for x and y. We know that John is twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release, so we can set up the equation:

2x = x + y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = y

Now we have two equations:

2x + y = 28
x = y

Substituting x = y into the first equation, we get:

2y + y = 28
3y = 28
y = 28/3
y = 9.33

Now that we know y, we can find x:

x = y
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of y to find Jim's current age.

Jim's current age is x + y = 9.33 + 9.33 = 18.66

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

Jim's current age is approximately 18 years.

The final answer is 18."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

4. We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Since they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 - 15 = 63 bandages at the end of the second day.

5. On the second day, they had 40 bandages left. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 40 + 28 = 68 bandages at the end of the first day.

So, the nurses started with 68 bandages on the first day.

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 
Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to find the amount of blood in a shark: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in a single shark by 10 to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens

Number of black pens: 2 times the number of red pens = 2 * 25 = 50 black pens

Total number of pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800. 

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: 1.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'x'. 

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house.

"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, we can find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first find the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total number of miles they need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, we divide the total number of miles by 4 to find the average. 8 / 4 = 2 miles.

So, the last dog needs 2 miles per day.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

For the first medicine, Saanvi uses 14 mL.
For the second medicine, she uses 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, she uses 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
John's class capacity = 15 * 2 = 30
Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school = 30 * 2 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's class capacity + John's school capacity = 120 + 60 = 180

"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay initially is $300 (the borrowed amount) + $6 (the interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find the amount he needs to pay in the 12th month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the 12th month.

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

The final answer is: 697.5"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station.
   The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The number of passengers on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $3. So, the total cost for 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $9 = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. 

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. 

3 full groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes
1 group with 2 students * 45 minutes per group = 45 minutes
Total time = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, first, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total original cost is $35 + $40 = $75.

The 20% discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for fingers and 5 for toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and then add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate it as follows:

Original amount = 20
Amount left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Since she had 5 pomelos left, we can subtract this from the original amount to find out how many pomelos she gave away:

Pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left
= 20 - 5
= 15

"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Since he sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

27 apples * $3/apple = $81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Assuming a 24-hour day, and considering he travels for 3 days, the total hours traveled would be 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

Final answer: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since the middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is: 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in total.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77 + 40
Total questions = 117

Since Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, we can calculate the number of questions she got right on the first test as follows:

Questions correct on the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct on the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct on the first test = 42

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test as follows:

Questions needed on the second test = Total questions - Questions correct on the first test
Questions needed on the second test = 117 - 42
Questions needed on the second test = 75

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, we can set up the equation:

x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers needed to get 30 customers.
Since 1 out of every 25 calls results in a customer, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 calls to get 30 customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

"To find the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

So, there are 40 robots.

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total items = 40 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs)
Total items = 100

"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes to get 360 minutes per day.

Now, we divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Phineas needs to cover and then divide it by his combined speed on land and in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Phineas will cover half of the distance on land, which is 200 / 2 = 100 yards. 
He will cover the other half of the distance in water, which is also 100 yards.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover these distances. 

Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Since these two times are not independent, we need to add them together to get the total time. However, since Phineas is moving in two different mediums (land and water), we need to add the time it takes to cover the distance on land and the time it takes to cover the distance in water.

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find out how much Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since June has 30 days, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts per month

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

So, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

600"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Total cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia needs to send her clothes to the dry cleaners for 5 weeks, we multiply the total cost by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we can use the formula: time = total words / speed.

time = 4500 / 375
time = 12 hours

The answer is 12."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw from the 4th day to the 7th day. Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, we multiply 60 by 4 (the number of days) to get 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped so far is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 80 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 80 + 80 = 160.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 40 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 160 + 40 = 200.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels. 
   The total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
1 gallon = 4 cups
6 lemons/cup * 4 cups = 24 lemons per gallon

Now, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for 5 gallons:
24 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 120 lemons

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required:
2 * 1 cup = 2 cups
2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
120 lemons + 12 lemons = 132 lemons

The final answer is: 132"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 legs = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 legs = 60 legs

Total legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Now, divide the total legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, there must be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32. We have 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, so the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
= 32 - (4 + 8)
= 32 - 12
= 20

The number of red blocks is 20."
"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

We know that the bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first. 

Since each bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, and one night at the hotel costs $80, the cost of one bus trip is 10% of $80, which is $8.

Now, we multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus trips: $8 * 7 = $56.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips: $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12, and there is 1 adult, so the total cost for the adult ticket is 1 * $12 = $12.

The cost of the child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is 1 * $8 = $8.

The cost of 2 popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 (adult ticket) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
- Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of items:
T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know:
8 + B + 16 = 29

Now, let's solve for B:
B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, the number of beakers he lost is the difference between the requested number and the actual number:
Beakers lost = 7 - 5 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the second basket first. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:
10 + 20 = 30

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can calculate the time she took to run 4 miles as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can calculate the distance he ran as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16
Distance = 16x

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance she ran would be 2 * 16x = 32x.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is equal to 32x. We can set up an equation:

32x = 4
x = 4 / 32
x = 1/8

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can calculate Vanessa's time:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/8)
Time = 8 * 8
Time = 64

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line.

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required. 

600 - 6 = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue:
- 6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals
- 12 meals * $5 per meal = $60
- Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65

Weekly revenue:
- $65 per day * 2 days per week = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the cost price of each watermelon as follows:

Let's assume the cost price of each watermelon is x.
The total cost of 50 watermelons is 50x.
The selling price of each watermelon is 1.25x (since 100% + 25% profit = 125% = 1.25).

We know that the total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can set up the equation:
50x = 80

Dividing both sides by 50, we get:
x = 80 / 50
x = 1.6

Now that we know the cost price of each watermelon is $1.6, we can calculate the selling price:
Selling price = 1.25x
= 1.25 * 1.6
= 2

So, the fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. This means John's youngest son is 18 - 19 = -1 year old. However, since you can't have a negative age, we need to re-evaluate the information given.

Let's re-evaluate the information: John had a son when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. This means John's youngest son is actually 18 - 19 = -1 year old, which doesn't make sense. However, we can assume that the youngest son is actually the son born when John was 32, and James is the son born when John was 19.

Since James is 18 years old now, and he is twice as old as Dora, who is 9 years old now, we can confirm that James is indeed 18 years old.

Now, we know that John's youngest son is 32 - 19 = 13 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 13 + 3 = 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320.
The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hired a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

Now we have two equations:

1) c + b = 20
2) 2c + 4b = 70

We can simplify equation (2) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us: c + 2b = 35.

Now we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'c': 
(c + 2b) - (c + b) = 35 - 20
This simplifies to: b = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'b' into equation (1): 
c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
