"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fibers: 2 bolts
White fibers: Half of 2 bolts, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the increased value, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (which is 100% + 150%).
$80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

Now, we add the cost of the repairs to the new value to find the total cost.
$120,000 + $50,000 = $170,000

The profit is the difference between the total cost and the original price.
$170,000 - $80,000 = $90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance of each sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance of each sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs in a week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first calculate the total amount of feed she has given to her chickens so far.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, so the amount of feed per chicken is 15 cups / 20 chickens = 0.75 cups per chicken.

In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, so the amount of feed per chicken is 25 cups / 20 chickens = 1.25 cups per chicken.

Now, we need to find the total amount of feed per chicken. To do this, we add the amount of feed per chicken in the morning and the afternoon: 0.75 cups + 1.25 cups = 2 cups per chicken.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 20 chickens * 2 cups per chicken = 40 cups.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

Now, let's add the cost of the first glass and the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

So, Kylar needs to pay $50 for 16 glasses.

"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file and the time it takes to restart the download:
40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes to download the first 60% of the file and the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Time spent in standstill traffic:
Time = 2 hours

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Time = 0.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Time spent driving at 80 mph:
Time = 4 - 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill traffic + 0.5 hours at 30 mph)
Time = 1.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances traveled in each part:
Total Distance = 180 + 15 + 120
Total Distance = 315 miles

John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, let's add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are $460.

Final answer: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.5

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5 (loss in the first year)

However, we are interested in when Carlos starts earning money. So, we need to find the year when the net profit becomes positive.

Year 1: Loss of $82.5
Year 2: $7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5 (still a loss)

The final answer is 100."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So, Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential profit: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
Total value at the end of the month: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential profit: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
Total value at the end of the month: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the total value of the jewelry ($5,125) is greater than the total value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit.

Profit from the jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

Her annual salary from coaching: 
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500

Total annual salary:

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4 to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When you spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of water to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 46/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

The final answer is 16.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond's age when his son was born, which is 23. To find the difference between Raymond's age at that time and his current age, we subtract 23 from his current age:

Difference in years = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age when his son was born
Difference in years = 25 - 23
Difference in years = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add up the DVDs sold: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to subtract the start time from the end time. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need: 
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract that from the total distance.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 
He traveled 60 - 20 = 40 miles after his first stop.
Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after his first stop.

Now, we add the distance before and after the first stop to find the total distance between the two stops: 
20 + 45 = 65 miles.

The final answer is: 65"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: 94"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162
Combine like terms: 18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages:
Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person says 80 jelly beans.
The second person says 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person says 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these three guesses. To do this, we add the guesses together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of silver coins and gold coins is 110. 

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The total points scored by Mike is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much he spent on the video games and the remaining money, we subtract the remaining money from the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets: 195 - 5 = $190.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent on video games from the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets to find out how much he spent on the Lego sets: 195 - 160 = $35.

Since he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount he spent on the Lego sets by the price of each set: 35 / 15 = 2.33.

Since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to 2 sets.

So, John sold 2 Lego sets.

To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had initially: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

The final answer is 4."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. The cost of the beeswax and the wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

The net profit is -$160.00, meaning Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice initially had, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

So, the total number of notes she initially had is 80 + 220 = 300.

Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can find the number of notes in the package by subtracting the remaining notes from the total.

Number of notes in the package = Total notes - Remaining notes
= 300 - 23
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of the blue ties. 

The cost of the red ties is 1.5 * 40 = $60 each.

The total cost of the red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total earnings for Thursday and Friday separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue for truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue for car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The total revenue for car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue for Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue for each day. 
$520 (Thursday) is greater than $480 (Friday), so Thursday has higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags he can fill.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the amount she receives in the remaining 10 years.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she receives in the first 20 years is:
$50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

In the remaining 10 years, Marcy receives 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension value is $1,000,000, the annual pension in the remaining 10 years is:
$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

So, the total amount Marcy receives in the remaining 10 years is:
$50,000 * 10 = $500,000

Now, we add the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years:
$1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000

To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we divide the total amount by 30:
$1,500,000 / 30 = $50,000

However, this is the total amount she receives in 30 years, not the annual pension. Since she receives the $50,000 pension for 20 years, we need to add the annual pension for 20 years to the total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years:
$50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000
$1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000

Now, we divide the total amount by 30:
$1,500,000 / 30 = $50,000

But we need to add the $50,000 pension for the remaining 10 years:
$50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000

The final answer is: $100,000"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid.
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. We can do this by subtracting the amount of gas used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (left in the tank)

Now, we can divide the amount of gas left in the tank by the amount of gas used to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank.

8 gallons (left in the tank) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 2

So, Sophia can drive 2 times the distance she has already traveled (100 miles) on a single tank of gas.

2 x 100 miles = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

Now, we know there are 60 girls and 120 boys, so the total number of students is 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 180 / 5 = 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Weekly allowance: $5
Total weeks: 8
Total allowance: $5 * 8 = $40

Bailey has $100 at the end of 8 weeks. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has:

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes.
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Since she charges $15 per student, the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * 15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in both recipes.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

The interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

Since there are 3 months, the total interest for 3 months is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $9 = $759.

So, Shiela will pay $759 each month for 3 months.

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the amount of laundry David does, we need to divide Sarah's laundry by 4, since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. 

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find his laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to calculate the cost of buying 3 packages of 3 flowers each and then add the cost of 3 additional flowers.
Cost of 3 packages of 3 flowers = 3 * $2.50 = $7.50
Cost of 3 additional flowers = 3 * $1 = $3
Total cost = $7.50 + $3 = $10.50

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost of 9 packages of 2 flowers = 9 * $1 = $9

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the worse option.
Savings = $10.50 - $9 = $1.50

The final answer is: $1.50"

"To find the number of games won, we need to first determine the number of games lost. 

Let's say the number of games lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is 22. 

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the number of games lost is 7. 

Now, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to the number of games lost:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.6
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.6 = $798.6

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.6 = 0.1 * $798.6 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.6 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Now, we solve for 'x': 
x = 38 - 2
x = 36

So, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 seconds is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Now, we add this to his original time: 
36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. 

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats:

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12:
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180
180 - 12 = 168 rabbits

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days and subtract that from the total time he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. To do that, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants:
2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 3 sets of 20 feet.

Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it will take 3 sets of 20 feet (60 feet) 3 * 16 = 48 seconds. This leaves 4 feet remaining to reach the shore. It will take 16 seconds to row the remaining 4 feet.

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took on in 48 seconds. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can divide 48 by 10 to get 4.8 sets of 10 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 4 sets of 10 feet.

4 sets of 10 feet will take 4 * 16 = 64 seconds. But we only need to consider 48 seconds, so we'll calculate the water taken on for 48 seconds. 

48 / 10 = 4.8 sets of 10 feet. Since it takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply 4.8 sets by 2 to get 9.6 liters.

The boat took on 9.6 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Since there are 8 lessons per day, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to divide the total number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6, since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. 
Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
New selling price = $180 * 1.5 = $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of 1 part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of 1 part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

The number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is 42."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the number of pairs of shoes he bought and multiply it by the cost of each pair.

The total amount John paid is $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate his salary four years ago and then add 40% of that amount to it.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 

40% of $40,000 is 0.4 * 40,000 = $16,000.

So, Adrien's current salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to find Lylah's salary four years ago:

Let Lylah's salary four years ago be x.

Then, Adrien's salary four years ago is 1.3x (since it's 30% higher than Lylah's).

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40,000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40,000 / 1.3
x = 30,769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Now, we can find Lylah's current salary by adding 40% of her salary four years ago to it:

40% of $30,769.23 is 0.4 * 30,769.23 = $12,307.69.

Lylah's current salary is $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92.

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $56,000 (Adrien's current salary) + $43,076.92 (Lylah's current salary) = $99,076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, Miguel uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets of paper per month.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept, we need to calculate the hours for each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.
On Saturday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.
On Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the week:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 35

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 35."
"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both parts: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. 

Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x. 

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters needing stamps is 2/3 of the original 60 letters. 

So, 2/3 * 60 = 40 letters needed stamps.

We know that after Jennie puts stamps on these 40 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters becomes 30. 

This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is x = 30 - 40 = -10. However, this is not possible since the number of letters cannot be negative. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is actually x = 30 + 40 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

Now, let's solve for x:
x + 5 - 3 = 12
x + 2 = 12
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought initially had 10 spoons.

Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"To find the total number of friends, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, let's add the number of friends Lily and Amy have together: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120."
"To find the cost of each item, we need to calculate the cost of watermelons and oranges first.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $100,000 - $30,000
Profit = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 in profit from these visits."

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday

   Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

2. Next, we find the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.
   Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left initially return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially returned) + 15 (in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left fly from the hive and leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.
Converting the total length of the croissants to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required for all the apes: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire 100 yards 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards per trip. She does this 34 times.
80 yards * 34 trips = 2720 yards

Since 2720 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 1220 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is: 
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3, which is (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of an action figure as follows:

1 red car = $4
1 action figure = 1/3 * $4 = $1.33 (approximately)

Now, we know the cost of an action figure. We can calculate the cost of the other items:

5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20
3 action figures = 3 * $1.33 = $4
1 doll = $4

Now, let's add up the costs of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $4 (action figures) + $4 (doll) = $28

The total value of all the toys is $28.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she would lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the money she would lose by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35/hour, so the total amount she would lose is:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant ($90) from the amount she would lose ($105):

$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age: S = 2B = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first find out how much money Ethel has, which is given as $8. 

Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we can calculate Jimmy's money as follows:

Twice Ethel's money = 2 * $8 = $16
Jimmy's money = $16 + $2 = $18

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so they have 80 * 8 = 640 legs.
Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so they have 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since the problem doesn't mention the age of the fourth bird, we can't determine its age. However, based on the information given, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know: 8 + 19 + 16 = 43.

The total age of the four birds is unknown without the age of the fourth bird."
"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first find out how much Jessica wants to pay for each debt. 

For her student loans, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $300. 
50% of $300 is $150, so she wants to pay $300 + $150 = $450 per month.

For her credit card, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $200. 
50% of $200 is $100, so she wants to pay $200 + $100 = $300 per month.

For her mortgage, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $500. 
50% of $500 is $250, so she wants to pay $500 + $250 = $750 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly payments: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500 per month.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000 per year.

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply those times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds
Total time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes:
95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Converting 5700 seconds to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

570"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate their total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members. 

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total number of Chinese team members - Number of boys on the Chinese team
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.
3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 4400.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity: 1/2 of 4400 is 2200.
5. Calculate the remaining amount after donation: 4400 - 2200 = 2200.
6. Calculate the total amount spent on daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900.
7. Calculate the final amount left: 2200 - 900 = 1300.

The final amount Zaid will have is 1300."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
10 * 5 = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
10 * 8 = $80

Now, let's add the earnings for both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of rolling 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 or 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities together to get (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we divide 1/4 by 1 and multiply by 100: (1/4) / 1 * 100 = 25%.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom: 10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (her mom's apples) = 30 apples.

The total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom is 30."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since the straw is distributed equally among the rats, we divide the remaining straw by 6 (the number of straw pieces per rat): 90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are in 3 cages, we divide the number of rats by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.

Total interest = Interest for one month * Number of months
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total selling price. 

Total selling price = $30 per bag
Total profit = $400
Total selling price - Total profit = Total cost
$30 - $400 = -$370 (This means the trader actually lost $370)

Since the trader lost money, we need to add the cost of transportation to find the total cost. 

Cost of transportation per bag = $2
Total cost = Total cost of bags + Cost of transportation
Let's assume the number of bags is x.
Total cost of bags = $20x
Total cost = $20x + $2x
Total cost = $22x

We know the total cost is -$370, so we can set up the equation:
$22x = -$370

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 22:
x = -$370 / 22
x = -16.82 (round down to -17, since you can't sell a fraction of a bag)

However, since the number of bags cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-examine the calculation:
Total selling price - Total cost = Total profit
$30x - ($20x + $2x) = $400
$30x - $22x = $400
$8x = $400
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour and then by the number of minutes in an hour.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. 

So, John collects peaches for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute, so in 180 minutes, he collects 2 * 180 = 360 peaches.

The answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

Total amount of insects per week = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years: 
10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees a year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:
100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3:
80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had after planting and chopping:
80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted them white and put them back out. So now, there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink plastic flamingos. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first calculate the total number of pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

There are 40 restaurants, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots in total, we can subtract the total pounds distributed from the total pounds to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds - Pounds distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, as he edits an equal number for both publishers. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to first calculate his total weekly earnings for the year, then add the monetary reward.

Since John makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total weekly earnings for the year would be:
2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the monetary reward of $5000:
104,000 + 5000 = $105,000

However, John also received a 5% raise in salary. To calculate the raise, we need to find 5% of his original weekly salary:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = $100

Now, we add the raise to his original weekly salary:
2000 + 100 = $2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his new weekly earnings would be:
2100 * 52 = $109,400

Now, let's add the monetary reward to his new weekly earnings:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   The cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, and $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 mowing sessions.

So, Sara needs to babysit 12 times and mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes. The big pool has also lost 16 gallons in the same time.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool had 2x gallons 4 minutes ago, it has gained 2x - 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

We know that the big pool has gained 2x - 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes, and it has lost 16 gallons in the same time. So, the big pool has 4x gallons now, which is equal to 2x - 16 + 16. This simplifies to 4x.

Now, we can set up an equation: 4x = 4x. This equation is true for any value of x, but we want to find the value of x.

However, we can use the information that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can set up another equation: 4x = 4 * (x - 16). This equation is true because the big pool has gained 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4x - 64. This equation is also true for any value of x, but we can solve for x by adding 64 to both sides: 4x + 64 = 4x. This simplifies to 64 = 0, which is not possible. However, we can divide both sides by 4: 16 = 0, which is also not possible.

Wait, we made a mistake. We should have set up the equation as 4x = 4 * (x - 16) and then subtracted 4x from both sides: 0 = 4 * (x - 16) - 4x. This simplifies to 0 = 4x - 64 - 4x, which further simplifies to 0 = -64. This is still not possible.

Let's try again. We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can set up the equation 4x = 4 * (x - 16). We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 4: x = x - 16. Adding 16 to both sides, we get 16 = x.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the amount of water in the small pool. The small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago, and it has lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes. So, the small pool has x - 16 gallons now.

Substituting x = 16 into the expression x - 16, we get 16 - 16 = 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

In three years, their ages will be:
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34.
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the four students: 
Naomi's points: 68
Yuri's points: 44
Brianna's points: 85
Total points of the other three students: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Since the total points of all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial 36 watermelons from the total.

120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons.

3/4 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we need to subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to produce 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed by 3.

63 / 3 = 21

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount Nancy owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has:
44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has:
48 / 2 = 24 bananas

Now, let's add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits is:
52 + 24 = 76

The final answer is: 76"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 66 / 12 = 5.5 cups.

The final answer is 5.5."
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to calculate 2/3 of 9,300.

2/3 * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find the total amount of money the girls have, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

There are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in all three bags: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we need to multiply that by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows.

12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."

The total cost of the items is $20.00. The mother pays $20.00, so the change she receives is $0.00."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines are Sean's, he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is 2/5 * 80 = 32.
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48.
3. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is 1/2 * 48 = 24.
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24.
5. 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is 5/8 * 24 = 15.
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9.
7. The cards with the letter D are the remaining cards, which is 9.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time it takes to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, let's denote Mico's age as 'x' and Marco's age as '20 - x'. 

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get 30 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800 spots.

Next, we find the total number of spots on the mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 15 + 30 = 45 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in each necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week: 20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 120 = 280 stories.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. 

We can write this as an equation: 39 = (1/10)x

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 10: 
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * 5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The rice will last for 3 weeks."

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off by.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids made after the initial bid is 3 (from the other people) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) = 4 bids.

The bids are $200 (initial bid) + $50 (first increment) = $250, $300, $350, and $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is $200 (initial bid) + $250 (first increment) + $300 (second increment) + $350 (third increment) = $1000.

The desk costs Carmen $1000."
"To calculate the total distance John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Distance to work and back is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance driven in a week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance driven in a year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the driving service:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven in a year = 15000 miles
Cost of driving service = 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus he pays is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

Total cost = Cost of driving service + Bonus = $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"

She spent half of $50, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Then, she spent an additional $10 for rides. 

So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had: $50 - $35 = $15.

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours * $10/hour = $100 per day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be:
$100 per day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month since the company performed well. So, his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is the same as 0.8).

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses in one week. 

8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

4 weeks"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left. 

The amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $4000."
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the rest of the family.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, they consume 9 * 7 = 63 eggs in a week.

The rest of the family consists of 5 - 3 = 2 people, and they eat 2 eggs each day. So, they consume 2 * 7 = 14 eggs in a week.

In total, the family consumes 63 + 14 = 77 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old six years ago.
   Noah's age six years ago = 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

2. Now, we know Noah's age six years ago, and we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago as follows:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 20
   Population of Chile six years ago = 60000

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can calculate the current population of Chile as follows:
   Current population of Chile = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
   Current population of Chile = 2 * 60000
   Current population of Chile = 120000

The final answer is: 120000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

2. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

3. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

4. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people at the beginning, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26 (total pencils Jam has). 

Now, let's solve for 'x': 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each and 2 loose pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam has: 
3 * 8 = 24
24 + 2 = 26

Jam has 26 pencils.

Now, let's add Meg's pencils to Jam's pencils: 
26 + 46 = 72

Since we know that Jam has 26 pencils, we can find out how many boxes Jam needs to store all her pencils. 
Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide 26 by 8: 
26 / 8 = 3.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, Jam needs 4 boxes to store all her pencils.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes were used. 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. 

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each trade involves 2 old records, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144000

Total amount = $80000 + $144000 = $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got in. 
At the second stop, 8 more people got in. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 
There were 20 people heading to the third stop, and 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 20 - 7 = 13.

Therefore, 13 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they got were 4 * 2 = 8 dollars off.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

"To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked in a year: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000. 

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has.

Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:

20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Total number of legs = 80 + 80 = 160

"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day
Revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day

The difference in revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100 per day.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly cost of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100
Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: 6240"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Wednesday: 0.5 hours
Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the daisies and roses. 

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

In total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the number of pots she needs from the total she had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.
Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know John spent 50 hours on vacation. He spent 40% of this time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:

40% of 50 hours = 0.4 * 50
time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract it from the cost of the phone.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, so we need to subtract this from her total earnings:
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs to save $195 to buy the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

She also wants $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget.

$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming she doesn't charge her friends for the activities), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend.

$60 / $0 = theoretically, but since she can't invite a fraction of a friend, we can say she can invite 60 friends.

However, considering the cost of the activities, we can say she can invite 60 friends if she doesn't spend any money on food, drinks, or other expenses."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

So, she saves $5 - $1 = $4 per day.

Since she saves for 5 days, she saves a total of $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. 
   He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

2. Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left from his original $10. This means he spent $10 - $2 = $8 on candy.

3. Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on candy ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5).
   $8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"To find the son's age, let's denote the son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can set up the equation: 
2x - 5 = 45

Now, let's solve for 'x':
2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two cities, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance of one trip: 
75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance by the service interval:
900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, it's more accurate to express the answer in decimal form.

The final answer is 0.05."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip to his friend's house, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

To find the time taken for the trip back home, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip: 2.86 + 3 = 5.86 hours

The trip took 5.86 hours."
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. We are given that 3 customers were kicked out for this reason.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.

We are also given that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3(4x - 5).

We know that the total number of people kicked out is 50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3 + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

3 + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

16x - 17 = 50

Add 17 to both sides:

16x = 67

Divide both sides by 16:

x = 67/16
x = 4.1875

Since x represents the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, it must be a whole number. However, in this case, x is not a whole number, which means our initial assumption that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks might be incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, then the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting would be 4(3) - 5 = 7. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence would be 3(7) = 21.

The total number of people kicked out would be 3 + 7 + 21 = 31, which is less than 50. This means that there must be more customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Let's try again. If 4 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, then the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting would be 4(4) - 5 = 11. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence would be 3(11) = 33.

The total number of people kicked out would be 4 + 11 + 33 = 48, which is still less than 50. Let's try again. If 5 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, then the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting would be 4(5) - 5 = 15. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence would be 3(15) = 45.

The total number of people kicked out would be 5 + 15 + 45 = 65, which is more than 50. This means that there must be fewer customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Let's try again. If 4 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, then the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting would be 4(4) - 5 = 11. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence would be 3(11) = 33.

The total number of people kicked out would be 4 + 11 + 33 = 48, which is less than 50. If we add 2 more customers to the total, we get 50. This means that 2 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

So, the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 2.

Now, let's find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4(2) - 5 = 3.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3(3) = 9.

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 2 - 3 - 9 = 36.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Sara's points before scoring 8 as follows:

Let Sara's points before scoring 8 be x. 
Then, Erin's points before scoring 14 will be 3x.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before scoring 8.

Now, to find Erin's points before scoring 14, we multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before scoring 14 = 3 * 4.67
Erin's points before scoring 14 = 14

However, this is not possible since Erin scored 14 points. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Erin scored 14 points, then Sara scored 14 / 4 = 3.5 points.

Since Sara scored 8 points, we can set up the equation:

8 = 3.5

This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem again.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Erin scored 14 points, then Sara scored 14 / 4 = 3.5 points.

Since Sara scored 8 points, we can set up the equation:

8 = 3.5 * k

To solve for k, we divide both sides by 3.5:

k = 8 / 3.5
k = 2.29

So, Sara had approximately 2.29 points before scoring 8.

Now, to find Erin's points before scoring 14, we multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before scoring 14 = 3 * 2.29
Erin's points before scoring 14 = 6.87

The final answer is 6.87"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

1. Picture frames: 
   Each frame costs $20, and 20% of that is $4. 
   So, the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Etching the logo: 
   Since 20% of the picture frames need to be etched, that's 20% of 44, which is 0.2 * 44 = 8.8. We'll round down to 8 since we can't have a fraction of a frame.
   The cost for etching the logo is 8 * $4 = $32.

3. Pins: 
   2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. 
   The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

4. Cords for officers: 
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 1/4 = 11. 
   The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$1056 (picture frames) + $32 (logo etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1210.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1210."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan made his own, he will save 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the materials is $400 - $80 = $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper. 

Total cost = $320 (materials) + $400 (original wallpaper) = $720."

3. On the last day, they sold one-half the amount from the previous day, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total: 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000 and 160,000 are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is:
400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000

Now, we need to find the value of the functioning pieces:
Value of functioning pieces = Total amount spent * (Number of functioning pieces / Total number of pieces)
= $400,000 * (240,000 / 400,000)

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest. The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue will be:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Since she spends $18 to buy supplies, her profit will be:
$36 - $18 = $18

To find her profit per hour, we need to divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade. We know she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total cups by the cups sold per hour:

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 + 26 = 52. However, half of them can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 52 / 2 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26. 

The choir's 3 teachers also join the performance. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

First, we add the scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser and the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil, then add the two amounts together.

6 erasers * $2 = $12
8 pencils * $3 = $24

$12 + $24 = $36

The total cost is $36."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Number of messages to Ms. Thompson: 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu: 1/3 * 66 = 22

Total number of messages delivered: 66 + 22 = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying individual tickets and the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of buying individual tickets: 
9 rides * 2 tickets per ride * $2 per ticket = 9 * 2 * 2 = $36

The cost of buying a ride bracelet: $30

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy individual tickets. 

Dasha buys tickets, so we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for her. 
9 rides * 2 tickets per ride * $2 per ticket = $36

The total cost for Dasha is $36. 

The total cost for David is $30 (ride bracelet) + $36 (Dasha's tickets) = $66

The amount of money David saves is $66 (total cost) - $30 (David's cost) = $36

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
= 144 / 12
= 12 inches

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 6 = 11. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the value of each part by the number of parts for each person: 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. 
20% of $10 is $2, so he saves $2 per month on each of the two services. 
The total savings on the two services is $2 + $2 = $4 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $4 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $14 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package is $60 - $14 = $46 per month.

The final answer is 46."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 1.5 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

The final answer is 21.43."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. 

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we need to find double the capacity first. 

Double the capacity is 2 * 36 = 72 books.

Then, we add 20 more books to that, so 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 cards.
Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she had 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.
In total, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
Now, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Then, she received 17 cards from family and friends.
Now, Erica has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12 and 1/4 of 12.

1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4)
1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3)

Jenny gives 4 slices to Bill and 3 slices to Mark, so in total, she gives away 7 slices.

Jenny had 12 slices initially and gave away 7 slices. She also ate 2 slices. 

12 - 7 - 2 = 3

There are 3 slices left."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, it means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more money to cover the cost.

However, if we consider the scenario where Mark can save money, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save:

$300 (bike cost) / $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

So, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike if he saves $10 per day."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30

Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, let's add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs:
90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks in a month and then multiply that by the number of months in a year. 

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks worked in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks.

Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of working days in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

The builder gets paid $50 per day, so his total earnings for the year would be 288 * 50 = $14400.

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 * 3 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of milk per batch. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 * 1 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. In 8 hours a day, it uses 8 * 900 = 7200 watts per day.

In 30 days, it will use 7200 * 30 = 216,000 watts.

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert 216,000 watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000.

216,000 / 1000 = 216 kilowatts.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage will be 3 hours (8 - 5 = 3).

The new daily energy usage will be 3 * 900 = 2700 watts.

In 30 days, the new daily energy usage will be 2700 * 30 = 81,000 watts.

Converting this to kilowatts, we get 81,000 / 1000 = 81 kilowatts.

The energy saved will be the difference between the original energy usage and the new energy usage: 216 - 81 = 135 kilowatts.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes.

There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, so 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
There is 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
There is 1 zebra with half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed, we first need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people watching the game, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total amount of money Tyson will spend, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns initially. After buying 60 more cannolis, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

Since he bought 40 fewer corns, he now has 0 + 40 = 40 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 40 = 140.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 640 hours
Total amount paid in May = 640 hours * $15/hour = $9600

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.
Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 480 hours
Total amount paid in June = 480 hours * $15/hour = $7200

Total amount paid in the two months = $9600 + $7200 = $16800

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, we apply the 20% discount on the total cost of the fireworks. 20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, and this is a subset of the candles that also explode. Let's denote the percentage of candles that explode as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 5% of 50000 = x% of 50000
0.05 * 50000 = x * 50000
2500 = 5000x
x = 0.5

So, 0.5% of the candles explode. Now, we can find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:
0.5% of 50000 = 0.005 * 50000
= 250

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price.
Discounted price = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:

3x + 60 + (number of apples gathered from average trees) = 500

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as y. Since Joanne gathers y apples from the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

Now we have the equation: 3x + 60 + y = 500

We also know that the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

Now we can substitute y with 440 - 3x in the equation 3x + 60 + y = 500:

3x + 60 + 440 - 3x = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

440 = 500

This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the number of apples gathered from the average trees. We know that Joanne gathers y apples from the average trees, and her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees. The total number of apples gathered from the average trees is y + 0 = y.

We also know that the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

Now we can set up the equation: 3x + 60 + y = 500

We also know that y = 440 - 3x. Substituting y with 440 - 3x in the equation 3x + 60 + y = 500, we get:

3x + 60 + 440 - 3x = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

500 = 500

This is true for any value of x. However, we know that the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees is 30. Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, she gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees. Since her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Now we can set up the equation: 3x + 60 + y = 500

We also know that y = 440 - 3x. Substituting y with 440 - 3x in the equation 3x + 60 + y = 500, we get:

3x + 60 + 440 - 3x = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

500 = 500

This is true for any value of x. However, we know that the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees is 30. Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, she gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees. Since her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Let's try to find the value of x. We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees. Since her sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees, we can set up the equation:

2x = 45

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 22.5

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 22 and x = 23.

If x = 22, then Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers 2x = 2 * 22 = 44 apples from the tallest trees. Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees, and her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees. The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 44 + 15 + 45 = 134.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 134 = 366.

If x = 23, then Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers 2x = 2 * 23 = 46 apples from the tallest trees. Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees, and her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees. The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 46 + 15 + 45 = 136.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 136 = 364.

Since 366 is greater than 364, x = 23 is not a valid solution.

Now we can try x = 22. We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers 2x = 2 * 22 = 44 apples from the tallest trees. Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees, and her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees. The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 44 + 15 + 45 = 134.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 134 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps is the sum of the number of humps on camels and dromedaries. We know that camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each. 

So, the equation can be set up as: 
2c + d = 304 (total number of bumps)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and dromedary has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries. 
So, the equation can be set up as: 
c + d = 180

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' and 'd' by solving these equations simultaneously.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' the same in both equations:
2c + 2d = 360

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':
(2c + 2d) - (2c + d) = 360 - 304
This simplifies to:
d = 56

Now that we know the number of dromedaries, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find the number of camels. We'll use the second equation:
c + d = 180
c + 56 = 180
c = 124

So, there are 124 camels and 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the initial elevation of Stanley (10,000 feet) to the distance the comb fell (4,000 feet). 

10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb (14,000 feet) and Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet). 

14,000 - 3,000 = 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

11,000"
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: 30 * 3/5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 20 months.

The first 6 months cost 6 * $8 = $48.
The next 8 months cost 8 * $12 = $96.
The last 20 months cost 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, let's add the costs together: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The final answer is: 424"
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total savings from the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. This means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

Now, we know that the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4 from them. So, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the original price of the jogger jeans is $32 - $6 = $26.

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans: $26 - $32 = -$6. However, since we are looking for the difference in the opposite direction, we take the absolute value of the result, which is 6.

The jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans."
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60 birds.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90 birds.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the cost of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price. 

25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
The cost of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake: 
$5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards. He keeps 1/3 of them, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

x = 150

However, this equation doesn't make sense because Kenny can't get $150 from selling 2/3 of his cards. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

x = 150

However, this equation doesn't make sense because Kenny can't get $150 from selling 2/3 of his cards. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = 1.5x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets 1.5x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

1.5x = 150

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 150 / 1.5
x = 100

So, Kenny started with 100 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, but there were 40 guests in total. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests who got two hotdogs from the total number of guests. 

40 (total guests) - 18 (guests who got two hotdogs) = 22

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it's 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount:
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons = 15 * 1/4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.

3 bags of chips = 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents
Since 100 cents = $1, we can convert 120 cents to dollars: 120 cents = $1.20

George spent $1.20 on chips and had 1% of his money left. To find out how much money he had initially, we need to convert 1% to a decimal: 1% = 0.01

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

x - 1% of x = $5
x - 0.01x = $5
0.99x = $5
x = $5 / 0.99
x = $5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on candy bars.

Initial amount - amount spent on chips = amount spent on candy bars
$5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by 75 cents to find out how many candy bars George bought:

$3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first find out how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide 20 by 4. 

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Rory and her mom each had 1 piece, so together they had 2 pieces. 

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Weight of the two pieces = 2 * 1 = 2 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, let's divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total number of people

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

Initially, the house is 40 degrees.

Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the temperature decrease is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

The final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature is 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 1 hour 25 minutes
James' bike time = 65 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time, and we know Jon won by 10 minutes. So, James' total time should be 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we know James' total time and his run time, so we can find James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' bike time - James' swim time
James' run time = 180 - 65 - 36
James' run time = 79 minutes

The final answer is 79."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can multiply the distance by the cost of hay per mile:

Total cost of hay = Distance * Cost per mile
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $3/mile
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of hay from the total money:
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find the number of glasses. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each, so the revenue from these sales is 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. He sold these for $25 each, so the revenue from these sales is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the colors from both types of packets.

Six packets had eight colors each, so 6 * 8 = 48 colors.
Four packets had sixteen colors each, so 4 * 16 = 64 colors.

Now, let's add the colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket.

The cost of a super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost of a super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + P = $21

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

P = $6

So, the regular price of popcorn is $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the original cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase. 
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 170 * $65 = $11,050.

The final answer is 11050."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one bed is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and height: 
2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume by 2:
320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags

Finally, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost:
160 bags * $12 per bag = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors.
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
= 10 + (0.6 * 10)
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to calculate half of Leila's money and add it to Ali's initial amount.

Leila had $100, so half of that is $100 / 2 = $50.

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Number of basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards

Total number of cards: 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are given to her students. 
Number of cards given to students: 350 total cards - 50 cards kept by Miss Maria = 300 cards

Since each student received 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10.
Number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. 9 - 8 = 1.

The difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky is 1 dollar."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room: 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items per room by 80: 15 * 80 = 1200

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

He starts with 200 shoes.
On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 200 + 5 = 205 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, so he now has 205 + 15 = 220 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, so he now has 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.

Now, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, so he is left with 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

The final answer is 70."
"To find out how many cupcakes Mary needs to bake, we need to multiply the number of jars of sprinkles by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

1. Calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils
2. Calculate the number of pencils used in two months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils
3. Calculate the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils
4. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year: 1/3 of 240 pencils = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils

There were 80 pencils left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, the number of students with desktop computers is (3/4)x. 

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without desktop computers is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x. We are given that this number is 20.

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk (7 days in a week, but he can only walk 4 days a week). 

First, we'll calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days. Since he can only walk 4 days a week, we'll divide the total days by 4: 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks.

Now, we'll convert the 5.25 weeks into days: 5.25 weeks * 7 days/week = 36.75 days.

Now, we'll divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the total number of days (36.75 days): 240 minutes / 36.75 days = approximately 6.51 minutes/day.

The final answer is: 6.51"
"To find out how many books Sarah gave to each child, we need to first find out how many books she bought in total. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books she bought.

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books per child

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts.

Total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the trip.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to first find out how many tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. This is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in each bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs: 200 / 50 = 4.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, the number of days from December 31st to July 19th is 183 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories in 183 days. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 183 days ≈ 19.2 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 19.2 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week. Since Gerald works $30 per day and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 30 by 7.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the number of laps by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.

Number of laps = 8
Water needed per kilometer = 60 ml
Water needed per lap = 60 ml / 0.25 km = 240 ml

Total water needed = Number of laps * Water needed per lap
Total water needed = 8 * 240 ml
Total water needed = 1920 ml

The total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 1920 ml."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. So, 3 times the number of passengers who got off is 3 * 21 = 63. However, this is the number of passengers who get on, not off. Since 21 passengers got off, 63 - 21 = 42 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 42 = 101.

The final answer is 101."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

The total cost of all three items is $2,400. To find the cost of one monitor, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

The cost of one monitor is $600."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

300 / 10 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that George has 3 candies left after eating 5. 

Since George had twice as many candies as Nick, we can represent the number of candies Nick had as 'x'. This means George had 2x candies.

We know that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 left. So, we can set up the equation: 2x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 3 + 5, which simplifies to 2x = 8.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 8 / 2, which simplifies to x = 4.

So, Nick had 4 candies initially.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times $13, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5.

5 - 4 = 1

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the final angle.

The sun moves 5 degrees an hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we subtract the angle the sun has moved from the initial angle:
32 - 50 = -18 degrees

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle:
-18 + 360 = 342 degrees

However, this is the angle relative to the ground. We need to find the angle from the ground to the sun. Since the sun is initially at the tip of the pyramid, the angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the initial angle, which is 32 degrees.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 32 degrees.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs in total. Since the older son is 12 and the younger son is 8, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 * $3 = $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find out the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first and second week.

70 + 100 = 170

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to follow the information given:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as 'x'. Then, the number of goals scored by Anna would be 'x - 45'. 

Since Richie scored 80 goals, we can set up the equation: 
x + 20 = 80

Solving for x, we get:
x = 60

So, Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 60 - 45 = 15 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
Richie: 80
Mark: 60
Anna: 15
Total goals: 80 + 60 + 15 = 155

The final answer is: 155"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * 4 = $84

Since Liam made $63, we need to subtract this from the amount Mitchell made to find the difference.

Difference = Total amount Mitchell made - Total amount Liam made
= $84 - $63
= $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day for 3 days. 
Total amount spent on wooden action figures = 5 * 3 = $15

He had $70 initially, so the amount left after spending on wooden action figures = 70 - 15 = $55

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day for 3 days.
Total amount spent on plastic action figures = 2 * 3 = $6

Now, subtract the amount spent on plastic action figures from the remaining amount:
$55 - $6 = $49

Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy = 49 / 2 = 24.5

Since you can't buy half of an action figure, we'll round down to 24 action figures.

Now, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures:
24 (plastic) + 3 (wooden) = 27 action figures

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

$600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 10 / 10 = 1 loaf
Cost of bread = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Since the cost is given per 10 sandwiches, we need to calculate the cost for 10 sandwiches:
Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $10668.

The final answer is: $10668."

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find 4% of the recipe's temperature. 

4% of 520 is 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30. 
60 * 1 = 60
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5.
60 * 2 = 120
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together to find the total time.
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we'll calculate 10% of $100 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10
Discounted price = $100 - $10 = $90

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be:
2 * $90 = $180

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain:
2 * 90 = 180 pairs

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we'll divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

x = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.99x = 0.99(1500) = 1485

Number of green jelly beans = 1.01x = 1.01(1500) = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time taken to travel 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional time, we need to subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional time = Total time - Initial time
Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

The final answer is: 4362.5"
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70.

Final answer: $-6.70"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 by 12:

28 * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to first calculate the cost of repaving his street. 

Cost per meter = $194
Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $94940

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between Monica's street and Lewis' street. 

Cost of repaving Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost of repaving Monica's street = $29,100

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
Difference in cost = $94940 - $29100

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:
- Month 6: $150,000
- Month 7: $225,000
- Month 8: $337,500
- Month 9: $506,250
- Month 10: $757,812.50

$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,812.50 = $2,380,562.50

Adding the cost of the first 5 months and the remaining 5 months, we get:
$500,000 + $2,380,562.50 = $2,880,562.50

So, the total cost of John's research is $2,880,562.50."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so 8 ounces of meat.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Since he has 20 pieces of gum initially, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate 25% of 100.

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Now, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate 60% of 25.

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright on the wave.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

Number of men = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15
= 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels.
Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can afford to miss before the total cost exceeds $600.

Let's assume he misses x classes. The total cost will be:
$60 + $10 * (10 - x)

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to $600.

$60 + $10 * (10 - x) ≤ $600
$60 + $100 - $10x ≤ $600
$160 - $10x ≤ $600
-$10x ≤ $440
x ≥ -44

Since Manny can't miss a negative number of classes, we'll set x = 0 (no classes missed) as the minimum number of classes he can miss.

However, the question asks how many classes he can miss before his parents won't sign him up again. So, we'll set x = 9 (9 classes missed) as the maximum number of classes he can miss.

Therefore, Manny can miss 9 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary, so it's $21000 / 2 = $10500

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10500 = $31500

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31500 * 12 = $378000

"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours.

The total number of likes is 20228.57."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.1 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

Since the final price paid on Tuesday ($398) is higher than the final price paid on the next day ($540), the difference is negative."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. Let's denote the sales of green hats as 'x'. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales of red hats can be represented as x/2.

The total sales for the first month would be the sum of the sales of red and green hats, which is x + x/2. 

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation: 
x + x/2 = 400
Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + x = 800
Combine like terms:
3x = 800
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 800/3
x = 266.67

Now that we know the sales of green hats, we can find the total sales for the first month:
Total sales for the first month = x + x/2
= 266.67 + 133.33
= 400

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 400
= 300

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales of both months:
Total sales for two months = 400 + 300
= 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours first. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Amount in bank account: $420

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally actually received $120 more than her weekly wage. However, the question asks how many dollars were withheld from her wage. 

To find the amount withheld, we can subtract the amount in her bank account from her weekly wage:

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, we can say that $120 was withheld from her wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find out how many whole eggs are needed.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 whole eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 
The monthly rent is $5000.
The monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $150,000 (plane cost) + $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $180,000.

The final answer is: $180,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' the same in both equations: 
2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'g': 
(2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70
This simplifies to -2s = -30.

Dividing both sides by -2, we get s = 15.

Now that we know the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting s = 15 into the second equation: 
15 + g = 20
g = 20 - 15
g = 5

So, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 * $6 = $42. 

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Adding the cost of the chips to the cost of the fried chicken and the soda: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, we need to subtract the total cost of the items he bought from the total amount he spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there's a twin who is 7 years older, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there's a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. Since there are three triplets, the ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'.

The combined ages of all the children are 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We can try different values of x and y to find a solution.

One possible solution is x = 8 and y = 6. 

The age of the older twin would be x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. In 10 years, Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

Now, let's add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years. 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the total bill includes the cost of vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check, we can set up the equation:
0.6x = $40 + x

To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides:
0.6x - x = $40
-0.4x = $40
Now, we divide both sides by -0.4:
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. The amount John leaves with is the initial amount minus the total bill:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

Red squares: 14
Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Total number of squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find the total number of chairs needed, we first need to find the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get 40 regular chairs.

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to get the total number of chairs needed: 8 + 40 = 48.

Since there are already 8 high chairs, we don't need to add those to the total. We only need to add the 15 babies, which is 15. So, the total number of chairs needed is 48 + 15 = 63.

To find out how many more chairs she needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs she already has (8 + 15 = 23) from the total number of chairs needed: 63 - 23 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"To find out how many points the class has, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of children of each generation.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Since we are asked to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city. 

There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. 
40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, she will set off 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city (120) and the fireworks she sets off in her backyard (15). 
120 + 15 = 135.

"To find the total number of people in the group, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 friends they meet up with. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends
Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed as follows:

Total number of drinks = 2 * Total number of people
Total number of drinks = 2 * 20
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = 3 * Total number of people
Total number of snacks = 3 * 20
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks as follows:

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * $2
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * $2
Total cost of snacks = 60 * $2
Total cost of snacks = $120

Total cost of drinks and snacks = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $80 + $120
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $200

"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry and then determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald spent $10, we can find out how much money he had initially by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the ratio of his part (3/5). 

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they still need to raise. 

They have already raised $2100, and their goal is $6300. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%: 
100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she will eat 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she will eat 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger will have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy will have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers they bought.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually loses $195 (total cost) - $0 (since he doesn't have to pay the fine) = -$195.

The final answer is -195."

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.33 x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 people, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all 5 people: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 20% of 100 voters. 
20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) votes.
50% of 20 = 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes.
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes for candidate A and B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. 
Total number of voters = 100
Votes for A and B = 50
Votes for C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck initially has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount. 
90 - 87 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we add 6 to Steven's total. 

10 + 6 = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. 

Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. 

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50 per day

To find out how much he saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:
$50 per day * 7 days = $350 per week

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.
The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor would be 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor:
2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Since she earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, and she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5 on Monday. So, her total earnings for Monday would be:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the extra $5. Her total earnings for Wednesday remain $30.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the cost of the series is $6 less than the cost of a normal movie, the cost of the series is:
Cost of series = $10 - $6
= $4
Since there are 200 movies in series, the total cost of the series is:
Total cost of series = 200 * $4
= $800

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
Total cost of older movies = 160 * $5
= $800

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Total cost of series + Total cost of older movies
= $800 + $800

Let's assume Emma's score is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy points will be x + 8 * 10 = x + 80.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma's berry points will be (x + 3) * 5 = 5x + 15.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so her time is x - 4. Ava's time is x + 4.

Since the points are awarded based on the time left on the timer, we can set up the equation:

5x + 15 = 30(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation:
5x + 15 = 30x + 120
Subtracting 5x from both sides:
15 = 25x + 120
Subtracting 120 from both sides:
-105 = 25x
Dividing both sides by 25:
-4.2 = x

Now that we have Emma's score, we can find Ava's score:
Ava's enemy points: x + 80 = -4.2 + 80 = 75.8
Ava's berry points: x + 15 = -4.2 + 15 = 10.8
Ava's time: x + 4 = -4.2 + 4 = -0.2

Since time can't be negative, there seems to be an error in the initial assumption. However, let's continue with the given information.

Emma's score: 5x + 15 = 5(-4.2) + 15 = -21 + 15 = -6
Ava's score: x + 80 + 10.8 + 30(0.2) = -4.2 + 80 + 10.8 + 6 = 92.6

The difference between their scores is 92.6 - (-6) = 98.6"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's find the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
2 x 30 = 60 dollars

Now, let's subtract this amount from the total cost:
64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining amount by 2:
4 / 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For two days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's assume that x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W. We know that the number of orange fish is 2W.

We can set up an equation based on the information we have:

3 - x = 2W - (4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 2W - 4 + 17 - x
3 - x = 2W + 13 - x
3 = 2W + 13

Now, let's solve for W:

2W = 3 - 13
2W = -10
W = -5

Since we can't have a negative number of fish, this means that our initial assumption that x is a positive number is incorrect. This means that the 17 fish taken out must have included all the white fish. 

So, the number of white fish taken out is 17. 

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a week and then multiply it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent on lunch is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train becomes 125 + 13 = 138.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans first.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to find 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, we need to find out how much money Mike will have left over if he pays with a $50 bill.

$50 (bill) - $30 (discounted price) = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's wage after 20 hours of work: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, we can set up an equation to find the number of goats she needs:

Let x be the number of goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We want 30% of this total to be goats, so we can set up the equation:

0.3(14 + x) = x

To solve for x, we can start by distributing 0.3 to both 14 and x:

4.2 + 0.3x = x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate x:

4.2 = 0.7x

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for x:

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used:
John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.
Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used marshmallows) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together:
17 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 8.5 S'mores.

Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores for each kid.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts.

First, we need to find out how long each person played. Since they played for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The better friend played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 70 - 20 = 50 minutes in total. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played by the three friends. 

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter, which is $0.25.
- The other two friends played for 10 minutes each, so they spent 2 quarters each, which is $0.50 in total.
- The better friend played for 30 minutes, so he spent 1.5 quarters, which is $0.75.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2 * (5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide 10 by 3:
O = 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%).
20% of 40 = 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

In total, Joe has sold and given away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars.
40 - 24 = 16

Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week.

Since John does 30 cycles of work a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cycles he completes in a week is:
30 cycles/day * 7 days = 210 cycles

Each cycle has 5 tasks, so the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
210 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 1050 tasks

Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks * $1.20/task = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game, we need to first find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. 

Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, and Sasha scored 14 points, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can find the total points Sasha scored in both games by adding the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of cards each person has. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms: 
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides: 
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: 
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 
Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is 153."
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40.
The cost of shipping the book is also 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60.
The total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

The book's original price is $32, but Amazon will only refund 75% of that. So, the refund will be 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Since the cost of shipping is more than the refund, Milly will lose $3.00 - $24 = -$21.

However, since Milly can't lose money, we need to consider the shipping cost as a loss. So, Milly will lose $3.00.

The final answer is: $3."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan initially had $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, it means she is in debt."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends on each activity: 72 videos (recording) + 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

The final answer is: 86"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of one turtle is:

Speed of one turtle = Speed of one kangaroo / 2
Speed of one turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of one turtle = 3 hours

Since there are four turtles, the total time it will take for them to travel across the highway is:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
We don't know the total distance, but we can use the fact that 3 kangaroos can travel it in 18 hours. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can use the speed of the kangaroo to find the distance:

Distance = Speed of one kangaroo * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now we can find the total time it will take for the four turtles to travel across the highway:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
Total time = 108 hours / 3 turtles
Total time = 36 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4:

Total time = 36 hours * 4
Total time = 144 hours

The final answer is: 144"
"To find out how many clay dishes they all make together, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes they made together: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as 'x'. We know that the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $50, so we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Now, subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk one cow produces in a day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we can divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find out how much milk one cow produces in a day. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow to find out the number of cows needed.

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs.

15 - 3 = 12

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are used is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

Now, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. 
The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 16 = -4 millimeters. However, since we can't have negative length, we need to recheck our calculations.

Let's recheck the calculations:
The first glue stick is 1/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/6) * 12 = 2 millimeters.
The second glue stick is 2/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 millimeters.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

We also know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

Now, we know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Peter has 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes.

30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $225 = $750.

For the third year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 3 years is $750 + $225 = $975.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Then, my brother's age is x + 3, and my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of our ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the ages are whole numbers, so we should find whole number solutions.

Let's re-evaluate the equation: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since we can't have a fraction, we'll try to find whole number solutions by testing the nearest whole numbers.

Let's try x = 15: 
My brother's age is 15 + 3 = 18.
My sister's age is 15 - 2 = 13.
My mom's age is 3(18) - 1 = 53.
The sum of our ages is 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 14: 
My brother's age is 14 + 3 = 17.
My sister's age is 14 - 2 = 12.
My mom's age is 3(17) - 1 = 50.
The sum of our ages is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 = 93, which is still greater than 87.

Let's try x = 13: 
My brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16.
My sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11.
My mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.
The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

So, the correct answer is 13."
"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs: 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 
So, Gretchen had 40 silver coins. 
To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) = 110

The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 = $12.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys: 200
Toys given away: 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now: 200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be paired. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means 80% of the microphones can be paired. 

First, we need to find 80% of 50 microphones. 
80% of 50 = (80/100) * 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

So, 40 microphones can be paired. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2 to get the number of pairs.
40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead: 
2/3 of 6 birds = (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds

Next, let's find the total number of birds in the groups: 
3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, let's add the birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the groups together: 
6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (in the groups) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = 55 - 5 = 50

Since she placed the rest equally into five jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5 = 10

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100 plants. 

100 * (1/4) = 25

So, there are 25 indoor plants. 

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants.

100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 

75 * (2/3) = 50

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants.

75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Whatchamacallit's speed = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

121 = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

To find the thingamabob's speed, we can divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob's speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob's speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob's speed, we can find the whirligig's speed. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the thingamabob's speed by 5:

Whirligig's speed = 5 * Thingamabob's speed
Whirligig's speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig's speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We also know that she eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. So, the total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

To find out how much Ellen pays for the carrots, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost: $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6 * 13 = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car:
10 rentals per month * 3 hours per rental * $25 per hour = 10 * 3 * 25 = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
$750 - $500 = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 per month.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she bought 5 more, we can calculate that she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks initially. 

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks initially.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. 

7 - 6 = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total distance Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance and add it to Dijana's distance. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 10 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's compare their total pages:
Denise's total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages
Daniel's total: 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total:
28 - 13 = 15

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to find out how many bowls of soup Calvin has left after everyone eats dinner.

Calvin has enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since he is an adult and his wife and two children will also be eating, that makes 4 adults. 

So, the total number of bowls needed for dinner is 4 adults. 

Now, let's find out how many bowls are left for the children. Calvin has enough soup for 8 child's bowls, and 4 bowls are taken for dinner. 

8 child's bowls - 4 bowls = 4 bowls left for the children.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the remaining bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch.

4 bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation: 
   Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
   60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
   52 = 2x - 8

2. Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
   52 + 8 = 2x
   60 = 2x

3. Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
   x = 60 / 2
   x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

4. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 38

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we need to add the size of both farms together. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons. 

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

Let's say the number of yellow balloons is x. Then, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 3x. 

We know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, and 2 pieces were thrown at each red balloon. So, the total number of pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 3x + 40 = 58. 

Solving for x, we get: 
3x = 58 - 40
3x = 18
x = 18 / 3
x = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."

"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5 for 2, the cost of 12 balloons is (12/2) * 0.5 = $3.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) = $14.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $14 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can say that the total amount they had initially is also $28.

To find out how much their mother gave each of them, we need to divide the total amount by 2. 

$28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Total toys she already had: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 more balloons.

Now, we add the initial balloons to the additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

The total number of balloons is 25.

25"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables.

15"
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets
Total money from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in the total money made from both machines:
Difference = Total money from Widgeteer 3000 - Total money from WidgetMaster 9000
= $259,200 - $194,400
= $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would pay, we first need to calculate the number of hours he stays at the hotel. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. So, he stays for 18 hours.

Since he chooses the 12-hour option for the first 12 hours, he pays 1000 pesos. 

For the remaining 6 hours, he adds 70 pesos for each hour. So, he pays 6 * 70 = 420 pesos.

The total amount Cameron pays is 1000 + 420 = 1420 pesos.

If he had chosen the 24-hour option, he would have paid 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron saves is 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

Since each pen costs 25 dollars, the number of pens he can buy is 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40

Cost of parts = $60

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sold 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for the CDs.
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110."
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She was given 15 stickers initially.
2. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. Her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.
Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

The total number of reports stapled is 1800."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep from 2:15 to 2:38 am. 
2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total time she was asleep. 
23 - 5 = 18 minutes

Since she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to bed at 10 p.m., we need to calculate the total time she was asleep in a 24-hour period. 
6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 20 hours

Now, we need to convert 20 hours into minutes. 
20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes

Now, we add the time she was asleep (18 minutes) to the total time she was asleep in a 24-hour period (1200 minutes). 
1200 + 18 = 1218 minutes

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 200.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, so the number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

   Non-work emails = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails = 9

2. Now, we find out how many of these non-work emails are to family.
   Emails to family = 2/3 of non-work emails
   Emails to family = (2/3) * 9
   Emails to family = 6

3. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 of non-work emails
   Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * 9
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then multiply it by 3. 

Aliya is 3 years old. 
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: 
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation:
S = 4A - 13

We are also given that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
X + S + A = 339

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the previous one:
(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
5A - 8 = 339

Add 8 to both sides:
5A = 347

Divide both sides by 5:
A = 69.4

Since the number of Pokémon caught cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 
A = 69

Now, substitute A into the second equation to find S:
S = 4(69) - 13
S = 276 - 13
S = 263

The final answer is 263."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2

Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first leg and then a northerly direction for the second leg, and finally a southerly direction for the third leg, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box. 

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes: 
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges to find out how many she sold:
240 - 60 - 80 = 100 oranges

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:

Half of 50 states is 50 / 2 = 25 states.
India has 4 more than half, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79 states.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much Tyler needs to earn, we need to add up the cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 
$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

Now that we know Jerry has 40 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since we can't have a negative number of cherries, we can say that Robert has 10 fewer cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday = 15
Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days. 

Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday = 10
Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday = 10 * $6 = $60
Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday = 15 * $6 = $90
Earnings from apple pie on Saturday = 11 * $15 = $165
Earnings from apple pie on Sunday = 15 * $15 = $225

Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225
Total earnings for Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between each plant (1.5 feet or 18 inches) from the total length of the flower bed. 

Total space taken by plants and spaces = 1332 inches
Space between each plant = 18 inches
Number of spaces = 17 flowers
Total space taken by spaces = 17 * 18 = 306 inches

Now, subtract the total space taken by spaces from the total length of the flower bed to find the total space taken by plants.

Total space taken by plants = 1332 - 306 = 1026 inches

Now, divide the total space taken by plants by the width of each plant to find the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed.

Number of plants = 1026 / 12 = 86

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 86 - 17 = 69 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = 69 * 6 = $414

The final answer is: $414"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can multiply 18 by 1/2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

18 * 1/2 = 9

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 9 pretzels by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

The total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The final answer is: $70."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 (monthly income) - $500 (monthly savings) = $1,500 (monthly expenses)

There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide her monthly expenses by 12 to find out how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$1,500 / 12 = $125 per month

Now, we can divide the amount she can afford to spend on shoes per month by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

$125 / $1,000 = 0.125 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

0.125 * 12 = 1.5 pairs per year

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we can round down to 1 pair per year.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

Now, to find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3 (since 90 is 3 times 30). 

10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. So, the room was cooled by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. So, the room was cooled by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour, so the room warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total change in temperature. The room was initially cooled by 6 degrees, then cooled by 12 degrees, and finally warmed up by 4 degrees. So, the net change in temperature is 6 - 12 - 4 = -10 degrees.

The final answer is -10."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 * 30 = x + 75 (since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years)

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Let's assume Walter's friend's contribution is x. Then, the total amount collected will be $2000 + x + 3x (since the lawyer contributes three times as much as everyone else).

We know that Walter's friend gives him $200, so the total amount collected will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we can set up an equation: 2200 = 2000 + 3x

Subtracting 2000 from both sides, we get 200 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 66.67

Since the lawyer contributes three times as much as everyone else, the lawyer's contribution will be 3x = 3 * 66.67 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

Since the total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Now, we need to find the total number of slices. Since the kids have 2 slices and the adults have 4 slices, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Since the total number of slices is 6, and the adults have 4 slices, we can find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets by dividing the number of slices for the adults by the total number of slices and multiplying by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

So, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. 
To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons for a month.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons. However, since the question asks for the expected earnings, we assume the studio is making money, so we will use the total monthly cost as the expected earnings.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract Martha's number from Peter's number: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

Total gallons = 10480 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61980 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = 61980 * 0.10
Cost = 6198

The cost to fill the pool is $6198."

55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons were pumped.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons were pumped.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The final answer is 94."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far.

He has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent so far: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he actually spent more than he had. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money he has.

Since he has $0.25 left, he can buy 1 plum at $0.25.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we need to divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

27

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to first determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

James reads 18 pages, and since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

18 / 3 = 6

Since it takes him 10 minutes to read each set of 3 pages, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes.

6 * 10 = 60

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the remaining guests are 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total revenue from large stuffed animals. Let's say Teresa sold L large stuffed animals. Then, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 12L.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals is 2L.

The total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2L * (x/3) = 2L * (12/3) = 8L.

We know that the total revenue from both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12L + 8L = 120

Combine like terms:

20L = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

L = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

Number of small stuffed animals = 2L = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in one week = 11 * 7 = 77

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by anyone else.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by anyone else. So, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we multiply the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe by 40 dwarves and 30 days: 
40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

The final answer is 43,200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he owes for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment. Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate it as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.1 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   25 red balloons * 40% = 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the remaining red balloons:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   12 yellow balloons * 0.5 = 6 yellow balloons released.

4. Calculate the remaining yellow balloons:
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   8 blue balloons * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons added.

6. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Her daily income is $15 per day. 
Her daily expenses are $3 for parking.

Total daily income: $15
Total daily expenses: $3
Net daily income: $15 - $3 = $12

Since she spends 6 hours a day, her total hours worked in 3 days is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Total hours worked: 18
Net daily income: $12
Total jury pay: $12 * 18 = $216

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes Uncle Franky ordered.

Number of apples in one box: 40
Number of boxes: 2

Total number of apples: 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs:

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years Jim spent in college (4 years) by his annual income before college ($25,000). 

$25,000 * 4 years = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned while in college. He received $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of money he received is:

$50,000 * 4 years = $200,000

To find out how much he earned while in college, we need to subtract the total amount of loans from the total amount of money he received:

$200,000 - $200,000 = $0

This means Jim earned the same amount he received in loans while in college.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost from not working while in school and the money he didn't earn due to the loans:

$100,000 (lost income) + $0 (lost income due to loans) = $100,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the lost income, we can divide the total amount of money lost by his new income:

$100,000 / $75,000 per year = 1.33 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 1.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the lost income.

The final answer is: 1.33"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric separately and then add them together.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.

The area of the first piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.
The area of the second piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to add the areas together: 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * 2 + $1 = $5.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $5 = $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $5 + $7.5 = $17.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $17.5 / 3 = $5.83

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $5.83."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as 'x'. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So, the first person took $420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38
Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30
Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,618.82
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,618.82 = $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,863.18."

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. 

Since the area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the area by the area of a single tile.

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile.

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he collected each year and add them together.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he now has 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers he has this year to the ones he already had: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 
Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's total by 2 to find Silvia's total. 
Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by all three: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit cost is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the visit cost is $300 / 2 = $150.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

So, the number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails in a day, he will respond to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, let's add up the scores:

Now, let's divide the total by the number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter required. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds of butter he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter required by 2. 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00 and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

So, the total cost will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost = $125 + ($6 * 21) = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 of $60 is $15.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 of $60 is $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$120 - $35 = $85.

So, Maggie and Riza have $85 left.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are three monkeys, and Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, we can find out how many bananas are left after the first two monkeys eat their share. 
The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 
So, the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 24.

Now, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey. 
315 - 24 = 291 bananas.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles.

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

The final answer is 750."
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (since 15 is 1.25 times a dozen) = $18.75.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she will need to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75 in total.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. For the remaining 75 cents, we need 3 quarters (since 3 * 25 = 75).

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and add them together.

Terry makes $162 in total."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = 1.2 * $2000
Selling price = $2400

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide it by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $2400
Discount = $266.67

Now, we can calculate the percentage discount:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = ($266.67 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring and then multiply it by the number of springs and the number of hours.

Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can assume that one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

So, in 1 hour, one spring creates 60 jellyfish (1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, they will create 5 times more jellyfish in 1 hour. 

Therefore, 5 springs will create 300 jellyfish in 1 hour (5 * 60 jellyfish/hour).

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour by 4.

Total jellyfish created in 4 hours = 300 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total time is twice the time it took him to walk to the store.

Total time = 2 * 0.5 hours
Total time = 1 hour

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then the total cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas, she will need 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of $500): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: 17.6875"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'x', they ate x/2 kilograms.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2
x = 540

This means that the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. Since they ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten the other half, which is also 540 kilograms.

So, the T-Rex ate 540 kilograms, and the triceratops originally had 540 + 540 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 2 (unshaken sodas) = 3 sodas.

So, the likelihood is 1/3 or 33.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which is 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of available days by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people
Number of people in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Total number of people: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years.

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 
5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance covered by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distance covered by Amber and Micah from the total distance. 

52 - 36 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00. She returned an item worth $15.00, so the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Sheila then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. The discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The discounted price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the items Sheila purchased is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00. Adding this to the new balance of $70.00, we get $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. We know that the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Lauren will live on 40% of her income, so she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years.

Total amount needed to save = $20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since Lauren saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work.

Number of years = Total amount needed to save / Annual savings
= $400,000 / $20,000
= 20 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount. Since she already has a 20-year retirement period, we need to subtract this from the total number of years she needs to work.

Number of years she needs to work = 20 years (to save) + 20 years (retirement) = 40 years.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since the question mentions James, but doesn't mention him buying any apples, we can assume James is the one left with the remaining apples. 

The total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples left."

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But we know she had $2 left, so the $2 must be the amount she had after buying the books, not the amount she had before buying the books. 

This means that the $10 she had before buying the books is the amount she spent on the books. Since she bought 2 books, we can divide the $10 by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5.

The final answer is 5."

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide 20 toys by 10 hours, which is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, since each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

Total weight of crayons and boxes = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Let's say it takes her x minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. We know that 2 miles will take her 40 minutes, so we can set up the proportion:

2 miles / x minutes = 1 mile / 40 minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 40 = 1 * x
80 = x

So, it takes Grandma 80 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the rate of speed, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, it will take her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk:

40 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 80 minutes

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount:
$28 / $4 = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny has 2 mugs of water initially. Let's assume the unknown temperature mug contains x ounces of water.

After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, Donny has 4 ounces left in the 33-degree mug. 

He also has 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, so the total amount of water he has now is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the unknown temperature mug contains y ounces of water. After pouring 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, Donny has y - 1 ounces left in the unknown temperature mug.

The total amount of water Donny has now is 4 + (y - 1) = 5 ounces.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for y:

4 + (y - 1) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 2

So, the unknown temperature mug contains 2 ounces of water.

Now, we need to find the temperature of the unknown mug. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the unknown mug is z degrees. After pouring 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, the temperature of the water is (z - 1) degrees.

The total amount of water Donny has now is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 2 ounces from the unknown temperature mug, which is 6 ounces. 

Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to solve for z:

(z - 1) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

z ≥ 41

So, the temperature of the unknown mug is at least 41 degrees.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 9 bagels in each pack. So, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

The total cost of the 4 packs is 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = Total cost / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 17 - 34 = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar.

"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 / 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his money, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

The revenue from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 7 = $84.

Since the total cost is $100 and the revenue is $84, Adam loses 100 - 84 = $16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the maximum number of days among them.

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 
Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We are also told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many Carrey collected, we can divide 22 by 2.
Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can find out how many they got when they divided them equally. 
Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.
Number of people = 3.
Number of seashells each person got = 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each, and there are 2 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

The first song is 5 minutes long, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices = 6 * $40 = $240

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost.
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $240 - $120
= $120

"To find Carl's cane length, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 
So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, Carl's cane length is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles are needed to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles are needed to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

However, we can also express the equation as:

x = 2300 * 0.2
x = 460

Since 460 is the number of bottles needed to meet the total demand, we can calculate the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

460 / 4200 = 0.109 (or 10.9% of the production capacity)

To find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce, we can multiply the production capacity by the percentage needed.

4200 * 0.109 = 462

So, Hortex needs to produce 462 bottles more to meet the total demand.

The final answer is: 462"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, that means 3/4 of 8 babies are wearing purple. 
3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.

Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we need to find 1/3 of 6.
1/3 * 6 = 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows, and 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows, we can assume that the remaining 1/3 of the purple wearers are not wearing bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (wearing both) + 1/3 * 6 (wearing only purple) = 2 + 2 = 4 babies.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
Probability = (Number of babies wearing both purple and bows) / (Total number of babies wearing bows) 
Probability = 2 / 4 = 0.5 or 50%

The final answer is 50."

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Abraham initially sold 40 square meters for $50 and 20 square meters for $30, so he earned $50 + $30 = $80 from those sales. Adding the $60 he earned from the last sale, he will have a total of $80 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

To find the number of eggs still hidden, subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs:

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments. 

John collects garbage from 3 complexes, 3 times a week. 

He collects garbage from 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments per week. 

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1040 * 0.40 = $416 per week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into R = 4B, we get R = 4(Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 and R = 4(Y - 7) into the equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 28 = 37.

Add 28 to both sides: 6Y = 65.

Divide by 6: Y = 10.83 (approximately).

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 10.83 - 7 = 3.83.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(3.83) = 15.32.

The length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

1/5 of $15 is $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. 

Now, Rissa has 4/5 * $15 = $12 left.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, the amount Ronnie gave to his sister is also $3.

Ronnie had $5 initially and gave $3 to his sister. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $2.

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, and the new box has 20% more pods, we can calculate the cost per pod in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. So, the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12.

The new box has 20% more pods, which means it has 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120 pods.

The cost per pod in the new box is $0.12 / 120 = $0.001.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. We can do this by dividing $1 by the cost per pod in the new box: $1 / $0.001 = 1000 cycles.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

James drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the percentage of teeth fixed by dividing the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James had initially and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (11 / 30) * 100 = 36.67%

The final answer is 36.67."
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school * 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Muhammad (I) brought home 12 apples.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
6 cheese pizza slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 cheese pizza slices
4 pepperoni pizza slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 pepperoni pizza slices

Total slices eaten = 36 + 24 = 60 slices

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, we divide 60 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs:
60 / 12 = 5

Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we divide 24 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs:
24 / 8 = 3

Kate needs 5 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. To find the total number of pizzas, we add these together:
5 + 3 = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. 

The equation becomes: 4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to find the value of 'x':

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left. 

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done, the total time required will be the time for the 3 full groups plus the waiting time for the remaining 6 students.

The waiting time for the remaining 6 students is 45 minutes, as they will have to wait for the next group to finish.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, Carly made a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. 

39 - 8 = 31

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and then add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. 
Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate it as follows:

Original amount = 20
Amount left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Since she had 5 pomelos left, we can subtract this from the original amount to find out how many pomelos she gave away:

Pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left
= 20 - 5
= 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

So, Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

25% of 36 = 36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, he traveled for 3 days, which is 72 hours.

Distance covered = Average speed * Total hours
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

There were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozens
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total selling price:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total selling price = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12

"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps:

1. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.
2. The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.
3. 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30.
4. The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the questions she got right on the first test from the total questions she needs to get right to pass.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent it as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, we can set up the equation:

x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.
5. Now he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls he needs to make to get 15 customers, we can divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

15 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 15 * 25 = 375 calls

However, we also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars, we can divide 15 by 1/2 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers).

15 cars / 1/2 car per 2 customers = 15 * 2 = 30 customers

Now, we know that Jason needs 30 customers to sell 15 cars. Since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls, we can divide 30 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

30 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 30 * 25 = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

So, there are 40 robots.

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total items = 40 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs)
Total items = 100

The final answer is: 100"

He spends 6 hours a day on calls, which is equivalent to 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day.

Since he works 5 days a week, the total number of minutes spent on calls in a week is 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the total number of calls:

1800 / 15 = 120

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped so far is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 80 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 80 + 80 = 160.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 40 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 160 + 40 = 200.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10. 
   So, 10 more kernels pop from the residual heat. 
   The total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the lemons needed for 2 cups as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The tower has 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights: 
$80 * 3 = $240

Now, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is $80. 
10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 * 7 = $56

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost:
$240 + $56 = $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas initially had 25, we subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12, and there is 1 adult, so the total cost for the adult ticket is $12.
The cost of the child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is $8.
The cost of 2 popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost for the popcorns is $3 * 2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 (adult ticket) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is given as 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. 

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Now, we add 2 hours to this half of Steve's time to find Anna's time. 

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total amount of feed ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs the guests will eat and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

The cost of hot dogs: 8 packs * $2 per pack = $16"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

Total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga per week is 5 * 7 = 35 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week. 
The total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes, which is equal to 3.5 hours.
The total time spent on yoga per week is 35 hours.

The total time spent on meditation and yoga per week is 3.5 + 35 = 38.5 hours.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we can convert the dozen to a numerical value: 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5: 36 * 0.5 = 18.

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original number of seeds in the small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate fills in a day.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. We can divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered is 29 - 24 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we need to find out how long it took her to run that distance. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed
16 = 1 / x (since Aaron ran 1 mile)

Now we can solve for x:
x = 1 / 16
x = 0.0625 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed:
Vanessa's speed = x/2
Vanessa's speed = 0.0625 / 2
Vanessa's speed = 0.03125 miles per minute

Now we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / 0.03125
Time = 128 minutes

Let's assume the cost price of one watermelon is x.
Then, the total cost price of 50 watermelons is 50x.
The selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).
So, the selling price of 50 watermelons is 1.25 * 50x = 62.5x.

We know that the selling price of 50 watermelons is $80.
Therefore, 62.5x = 80
x = 80 / 62.5
x = 1.28

Now, we know the cost price of one watermelon is $1.28.
The selling price of one watermelon is 1.25 times the cost price.
So, the selling price of one watermelon is 1.25 * 1.28 = $1.6.

The final answer is: $1.6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour:

Ana peels: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
Jane peels: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320.
The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hired a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's assume the number of chickens is 'x'. Since there are 20 animals in total, the number of cows will be 20 - x.

The total number of legs can be represented by the equation: 2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation: 
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4): 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
