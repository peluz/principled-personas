"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to first determine the original value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, which means the value of the house is now 2.5 times its original value (100% + 150% = 250% = 2.5). 

So, the new value of the house is $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

Josh initially invested $50,000 in repairs, so his total investment is $80,000 (original value) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total investment from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

James runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

Total meters per sprint = 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Total meters per week = 180 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 cups / 20 chickens = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 cups / 20 chickens = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed per chicken is 0.75 cups + 1.25 cups = 2 cups per chicken.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 20 chickens * 2 cups per chicken = 40 cups.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add up the number of sheep each city has to find the total number of sheep: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 3 hours, the first 2 hours of the return trip, and the last 2 hours of the return trip.

1. Distance covered in the first 3 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance covered in the first 2 hours of the return trip:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

3. Distance covered in the last 2 hours of the return trip:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 160 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance covered in the return trip:
Total distance covered in the return trip = 15 miles + 160 miles
Total distance covered in the return trip = 175 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance covered in the entire trip:
Total distance covered = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Total distance covered in the return trip
Total distance covered = 180 miles + 175 miles
Total distance covered = 355 miles

Since John started 180 miles away from home, we need to subtract the total distance covered from the initial distance to find the distance from home:
Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance covered
Distance from home = 180 miles - 355 miles
Distance from home = -175 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the total distance covered in the entire trip as the distance from home.

The correct calculation is:
Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance covered
Distance from home = 180 miles - 180 miles
Distance from home = 0 miles

The final answer is: 0"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to break it down into two parts: regular hours and overtime hours.

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 - 40 = 5 hours

Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime earnings: 5 hours * 1.2 * $10/hour = 5 * 12 = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: 460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to consider the net profit as a positive value, as it represents the amount of money Carlos earns each year. To find the break-even point, we need to divide the initial cost by the net profit.

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit) = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to break even, but this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that the tree will start producing lemons after the first year.

In the first year, Carlos will have a loss of $82.50, but in the second year, he will start earning $7.50. To find the number of years it takes to start earning money, we can calculate the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost.

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit) = 12 years

However, this is the total number of years to break even. To find the number of years it takes to start earning money, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of years.

12 years - 1 year = 11 years

So, it will take 11 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 11"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day and the distance covered by each train on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider them as moving in the same line. Therefore, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

On the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider them as moving in the same line. Therefore, the distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days. 

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
= 80 miles + 150 miles
= 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
- 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
- 50 weeks/year * $700/week = $35,000/year

Her annual salary from coaching: 
- 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week
- 50 weeks/year * $450/week = $22,500/year

Total annual salary:

"To find the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of eggs she eats per day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs per day, she eats 3 x 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 

84 ÷ 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the required speed, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered and the total time she has taken so far.

Distance covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Time taken = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to take to cover the entire distance.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours, she needs to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

To find the required speed, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to add the water from both drinks together: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 28/3 liters.

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide 28 by 3: 28 ÷ 3 = 9 remainder 1, so 28/3 = 9 1/3.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 1/3 liters.

Final answer: 9 1/3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 
4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the price he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the price Kyle paid is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

So, the original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box to find out how many boxes she ordered:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. After his first stop, he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so he traveled 40 - 15 = 25 miles after his second stop.

The distance between his first and second stops is the distance he traveled after his first stop minus the distance he traveled after his second stop, which is 25 - 15 = 10 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: 
B - 5 = 99

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
B = 99 + 5
B = 104

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, 25% more than that is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30:

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John has. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he has is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

However, the problem states that he has $5 left, not $35. This means that he actually spent $30 more than he had. This is not possible, as he can't spend more than he has. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. John buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. He has $5 left, so he must have had $160 + $5 = $165 initially.

Since he sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, the total amount of money he had initially is 13 * 15 = $195. However, we know that he actually had $165. This means that he must have sold some lego sets for less than $15 each.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. John buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. He has $5 left, so he must have had $160 + $5 = $165 initially.

"To find John's speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day, and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days. 

Total hours run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Since he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, we can calculate his speed as follows:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. We can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon while holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. 

First, we know that Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of pie is 5 x 8 = 40.

We also know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining after the guests took some. To find out how many pieces were taken, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have left: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 4 grams of chips.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, net profit = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

The net profit is -$160.00, meaning Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours spent on each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours on Wednesday.

To find the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days, we add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work, leaving her with 80 - 220 = -140 Post-it notes. However, this is not possible since she can't have a negative number of Post-it notes. This means that the 220 Post-it notes she used at work must have been in addition to the ones she already had in her purse.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she had in her purse and the ones she purchased. Let's call the number of Post-it notes in the package 'x'. 

We know that the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 80 + x. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes she had initially is also equal to 80 + x - 220.

Equating these two expressions, we get:

80 + x = 80 + x - 220

Subtracting 80 from both sides gives us:

x = x - 220

Adding 220 to both sides gives us:

x = 220

So, the package she purchased contained 220 Post-it notes.

The final answer is: 220"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, and he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Total number of floors = 15
Number of occupied floors = 3/4 * 15 = 11.25 (round down to 11, since we can't have a fraction of a floor)

Since each floor has 8 units, the total number of occupied units is:
11 floors * 8 units/floor = 88 units

Now, we can find the total number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Total number of units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
= 120 - 88
= 32 units

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since we don't know the exact time he started, we can assume he traveled for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the weight of the comic books Uriah is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 truck tires * $60 = $360
4 car tires * $40 = $160
Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 car tires * $40 = $480
Total revenue for Friday = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags he can fill.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide his available budget by that amount.

The total cost of a movie outing is the cost of the ticket plus the cost of popcorn, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we divide Peter's available budget by the total cost of a movie outing: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The final answer is: 187"
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

1. The cost of the material: $500
2. The cost of construction: $800
3. The insurance cost: 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130

Now, let's add up the costs: $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430

Janet paid a total of $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. 

For the remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension value increases by 5% each year, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years and then take 5% of that value.

The value of the pension after 20 years can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial pension), r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

A = 50000(1 + 0.05)^20
A ≈ 50000(3.491)
A ≈ 174,950

Now, we take 5% of this value to find Marcy's annual pension for the remaining 10 years:
5% of 174,950 = 0.05 * 174,950 ≈ 8,747.50

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the fixed pension for the first 20 years and the 5% of the pension value for the remaining 10 years:
$50,000 + $8,747.50 = $58,747.50

The final answer is: 58,747.50"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount she paid for the first half is:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the original amount and subtract it from the original amount.

10% of $140 is $14, so the amount she paid for the second half is:

$140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half is:

$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount she paid for the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The total capacity of her tank is 12 gallons. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, the remaining amount of gas in the tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

We also know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last filling. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we need to divide the remaining amount of gas (8 gallons) by the miles she has already traveled (100 miles).

Miles per gallon = Total miles / Total gallons
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 8 gallons
Miles per gallon = 12.5 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive 12.5 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time Jim spends on TV and reading each day. He spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, in total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours per day on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on TV and reading per week is 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

Now, we need to calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks. Multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 teams/school * 4 schools = 8 teams.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 players/team * 8 teams = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach, and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of coaches is 1 coach/school * 4 schools = 4 coaches.

Now, we add the total number of teams, players, and coaches to find the total number of people sent by the schools. 

Total number of people = 8 teams + 40 players + 4 coaches = 52 people.

Final answer: 52"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of rubies and emeralds.

Let's start with the number of rubies. We know that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, we can subtract 35 from 175 to find the number of rubies:

175 - 35 = 140 rubies

Now, we know that there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies. To find the number of emeralds, we can multiply the number of rubies by 2:

140 * 2 = 280 emeralds

Now that we have the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, we can find the total number of gems in the chest by adding them together:

175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the initial amount of money Bailey had. We know that she received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received is $5 * 8 = $40.

Since she had a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount:

Initial amount + $40 = $100

To find the initial amount, we subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:

Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from weekdays and Saturday separately.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 days a week. So, her weekday earnings are 5 classes/day * 5 days/week * $15/student = $125/week.

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes, so her Saturday earnings are 8 classes * $15/student = $120.

To find her total weekly earnings, we add her weekday earnings and Saturday earnings: $125 + $120 = $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of instructions in the second recipe. Since the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, we can multiply the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment. The total amount to be paid is the total cost of the cell phones plus the total interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $765 / 3 = $255.

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average:
30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 180 days and the rest of the puppy's life.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since the puppy's life is not specified, we will assume it lives for 365 days in a year. So, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can divide 400 by 4 to find out how much laundry David does. 

400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find out how much laundry Raymond does. 

400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David. 

200 (Raymond) - 100 (David) = 100 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is 100 pounds."
"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we need to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each and 0 packages of 0 flowers (which is not possible).
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
$15 - $9 = $6

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is x + 8, we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Then, Lee's original time would be 'x - 2'. We know that Lee's new time is 38 seconds, and his speed has improved by 10%. 

Since speed is inversely proportional to time, we can set up the following equation:

(x - 2) / x = 0.9

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

x - 2 = 0.9x
0.1x = 2
x = 20

So, Gerald's original time was 20 seconds. Now, we can find his new time by applying the 10% improvement:

New time = 20 * 1.1
New time = 22 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 22 seconds with his improved diet.

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of tomatoes by 16 to find the number of cans used.

64 ounces (tomatoes) / 16 ounces (per can) = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans used by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city: 
Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 3 miles / 10 minutes
Rate = 0.3 miles per minute

Now, we can find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city:
Time = Total Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board, which is 1/4 * 1000 = 250 pieces.

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 1/3 * 750 = 250 pieces.

Now, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to be placed.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can multiply Amir's cookies by 3 to find Cody's cookies.

Cody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, we need to add the number of cookies Amir and Cody eat together. 

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the total time Frankie watched TV:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time spent watching on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. So, we can set up the equation:

1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5 from both sides:

0.5x = 2

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 4

Since 'x' represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, the total time spent watching on Wednesday is 0.5x = 0.5 * 4 = 2 hours. Since each episode is 30 minutes, Frankie watched 2 / 0.5 = 4 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

This year, he baked 2x cookies, but he actually baked 15 more than he meant to. So, the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that he has a total of 110 cookies now. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas without the rewards, and then subtract the rewards.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas without the rewards is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback rewards are:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the rewards from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up and then multiply it by the number of rolls.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls long = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, the total number of roll-ups eaten is also 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:
90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Julia to row to the shore:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet per second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

The final answer is: 12.8"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of those flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers he has, we subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone. So, we can write the equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, we can write the equation:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. Since the total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20, we can divide the total amount of sugar (120 teaspoons) by the total parts (20) to find the value of one part.

120 teaspoons / 20 = 6 teaspoons per part

Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 6 teaspoons per part by 7:

6 teaspoons per part * 7 parts = 42 teaspoons

The final answer is 42."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of vehicles that were imported on the first day. 

Since there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know that four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his current salary. We can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume that her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's. However, we don't know Lylah's original salary. We can represent Lylah's original salary as 'x'. 

We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now that we know Lylah's original salary, we can calculate her new salary four years later:

New salary = $30,769 + (40% of $30,769)
= $30,769 + 0.4 * $30,769
= $30,769 + $12,307.60
= $43,076.60

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= $72,800 + $43,076.60
= $115,876.60

The final answer is: $115,876.60"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used per week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets used per week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 hours * 10 miles/hour = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 hours * 5 miles/hour = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is one-third of the original number of letters needing stamps.

Let's denote the original number of letters needing stamps as x. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is x/3.

We are given that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. So, we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 30 * 3
x = 90

This means that Jennie had 90 letters needing stamps initially. 

The number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is not directly given, but we can find it by subtracting the number of letters needing stamps from the total number of letters. However, we are asked to find the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, which is the same as the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is equal to the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 30.

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 30.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband gave her 5 spoons, so now she has x + 5 spoons.

She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she has x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons left.

We know that she had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 in profit per day."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can multiply 4 by 6 to find the miles walked on Tuesday: 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday. 

Total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday = 41 miles
Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 24 miles

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation:
3(2Q) + Q = 700
Expand and simplify:
6Q + Q = 700
Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Now, divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his weekly earnings would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars. 10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of legos Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the second 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (30) leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours hadn't already returned. Since 45 bees had returned, 30 bees (initially left) + 15 bees (returned in the second 6 hours) = 45 bees had returned. So, 60 - 45 = 15 bees that left in the last 6 hours hadn't returned yet.

In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees (15) return to the hive.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

Final answer: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total cost of the tickets. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find the number of friends Dorothy has.

12 / 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find the number of friends James has.

4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distances to the same units. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. 

Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Steve's time = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = $5.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial number of fries in the pack must be 47 + 5 = 52 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet. 
- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. 
She covers 40 yards to the 40-yard line and then 40 yards back to the starting point, so she covers 80 yards per trip. 
34 trips * 80 yards = 2720 yards

Since 2720 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 1220 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2 * 8 = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first find out how much Jessica wants to pay for each debt. 

For her student loans, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $300. 
50% of $300 is $150, so she wants to pay $300 + $150 = $450 per month.

For her credit card, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $200.
50% of $200 is $100, so she wants to pay $200 + $100 = $300 per month.

For her mortgage, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $500.
50% of $500 is $250, so she wants to pay $500 + $250 = $750 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly payments: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500 per month.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000 per year.

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prep one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes)

Now, we multiply the total time to prep one potato by the total number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

Converting the result to seconds for easier understanding:
94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 5699.94"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost. 

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $3 (cost of lemons and sugar) = $28.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar. We know that the total revenue is $28 and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Since they made $25 in profit, the total cost of lemons and sugar must be $28 - $25 = $3. 

Since the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, the cost of lemons must be $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

Since there are 240 participants in total and 80 are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left, we need to calculate the expenses and donations first.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

122"
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks.

130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses and white carnations. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. This means the number of red roses is 4x.

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying x by 4. The number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of 30, which is 15. 
This means two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

We also know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark. 
So, Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then find the difference between them.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the two probabilities:

(3/6) - (1/2) = (3/6) - (3/6) = 0

However, we need to express this as a percentage. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply by 100:

(0) * 100 = 0%

So, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is 0%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples by dividing her mom's apples by 2.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

For the hamsters, there are 10 cages with 5 pieces of straw each, so the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

For the rabbits, there are 20 pieces of straw used.

The total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the total number of straw pieces used for the rats (90) by 6 to find the number of rats in each cage. 

90 / 6 = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 rats in each cage.

"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month, then multiply it by 3 since Mandy paid after 3 months.

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Total interest for 3 months = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $100 + $6
Total amount = $106

The final answer is: 106"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total cost of the bags of wheat. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost of the bags is the cost of the bags plus the cost of transportation. 

The cost of the bags is $20x, and the cost of transportation is $2x. Therefore, the total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation $8x = $400. Solving for x, we get x = $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Now, we need to add the cost of the rides to the total cost. 

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To determine the amount of insects needed per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount: 3.5 pounds
Days in a week: 7

Insects needed per day = Weekly amount / Days in a week
Insects needed per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects needed per day = 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

Final answer: 0.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has over the 10-year period.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of trees after 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. We start with 50 trees and add the net gain of 80 trees over 10 years: 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Now, we calculate 30% of 130 trees: 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

So, 39 trees die. To find the number of trees left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left.

Final answer: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, the neighbors painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added 18 more pink plastic flamingos. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first calculate the total number of pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants. 

Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each will receive: 
40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available to find the amount that will not be used:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

Therefore, there are 6277 children in Soda.

Final answer: 6277"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find the amount Mark earns from Publisher A.

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2 to find the amount Mark earns from Publisher B.

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers.

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100. 

So, his new weekly salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year. There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Total earnings = (Weekly salary * Number of weeks) + Monetary reward
Total earnings = ($2100 * 52) + $5000
Total earnings = $109,800 + $5000
Total earnings = $110,800

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese in it. 

Now, let's add up the total number of slices of cheese Carl used: 
14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens: 
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens Janet initially had to the number of pens she bought:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens
32 pens + 54 blue pens = 86 pens
86 pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (excluding the lowest score) from the total required score: 558 - 358 = 200.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 200 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the kilometers he rode in the last three weeks separately.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total: 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

The final answer is: 460"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Since a dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

We also know that half a dozen plates is 6 plates.

The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

240 cups * x = 6000 + 1200

where x is the cost of one cup.

Simplifying the equation:

240x = 7200

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 7200 / 240
x = 30

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $30.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the total amount, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to babysit 8 times and mow the lawn 40 - 8 = 32 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combining like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8r = 32.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get r = 4.

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day. We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is x + (x + 50). We know that this sum is equal to 500.

So, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms: 
2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides: 
2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 225

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 225), we can find the number of customers on the second day: 
x + 50 = 225 + 50 = 275

The number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is 225 + 275 = 500. However, we are asked to find the number of customers on the third day. Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, and we know that the first two days had 500 customers combined, the number of customers on the third day must be 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4 times the amount in the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

Since the total amount of water lost is 16 gallons, the sum of the initial amounts of water in both pools minus the total amount lost should equal the current amounts of water in both pools. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the current amount of water in the small pool (y) is the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the amount lost from the small pool in 4 minutes. Since the small pool leaks at 4 gallons/minute, the amount lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. So, y = x - 16.

Now we can substitute y = x - 16 into the equation 2x - 16 = 4y:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides, we get:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

x = 24

Now that we know x = 24, we can find y by substituting x into y = x - 16:

y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she will pay $1980, we subtract this from the total amount she needs to return:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janeth's remaining balance will be $220.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, then calculate their ages in three years, and finally find the average of their ages.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. We add 3 to each of their current ages.

Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

Now, we can find the average of their ages in three years by adding their ages and dividing by 3.

Average age in 3 years = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age in 3 years = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age in 3 years = 135 / 3
Average age in 3 years = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores: 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend. This means his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, which is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.

2. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, together they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day.

3. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week is 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes.

4. Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices needed as follows:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram is essentially recycling the ink from the used pens to make new ones. 

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he mixes the ink from the 25 pens to make 25 new pens. 

So, the total number of pens Ram has is the initial 25 pens plus the 25 new pens he made from the recycled ink. 

Total pens = Initial pens + New pens
Total pens = 25 + 25
Total pens = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny initially had $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had was $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply $30 by 3 to get the final amount: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to first find the ages of Mary and Joan.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 
Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years.

The final answer is: 68"

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies.

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he sends and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he has used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin had 27 fries in the end. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 5 weeks, so the total hours worked is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 hours.

Since she charges $250 an hour, the total amount she would have charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

However, she receives a 10% discount for the total amount of work done. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total amount charged minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies each person ate and then multiply by the calories per cookie.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each person:
- Sue's sister: 5 cookies * 200 calories = 1000 calories
- Sue: 20 cookies * 200 calories = 4000 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue: 4000 - 1000 = 3000 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first two classes
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
Boys in the third class = Total boys - Girls in the third class
= 30 - 3
= 27 boys

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know that he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

4 * 21 = 84

Robert went down the slide 84 times.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, and there are 10 stalls. So, the total number of cows is 20 * 10 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Now, he divides the 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall, we divide 240 by 20, which equals 12.

Since we are asked to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall (12) by 8. 

12 * 8 = 96

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. 

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of the total weight of the redwood. 

First, we find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections. 

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds. 

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we multiply 8000 by 0.3 to find the weight of the wood eaten: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds. 

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find out how many stitches the two sleeves take, we subtract the total number of stitches in the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater. 
So, 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since we know that M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of spots on the mambas. Since the cobra has twice as many spots as the mamba, and the cobra has 70 spots, the mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we know that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots they all have combined is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

Number of team members: 12
Number of coaches: 3
Number of guests per team member: 2
Total number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24
Total number of people: 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy: 39 / 3 = 13

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be: 13 * $15 = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length available for the silver beads. 

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (length taken up by gemstones) = 17 inches

Since each silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we divide the available length by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used.

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 * 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to first find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled it in the second week, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week. 
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled it in the second week, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week. 
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled it in the second week, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written by each person in both weeks:
Alani's total: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which equals 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. Since Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. We can set up the equation:

39 = 10x / 10

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 10:

39 * 10 = x
390 = x

So, the number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the 8 children. 

To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To determine how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day, excluding Monday and Friday, and then add the number of crates he sold over the weekend.

On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates.

Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

In total, Sam sold 45 + 20 = 65 crates.

Since his target was 120 crates, we can calculate the difference by subtracting the total number of crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55.

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1,800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1,800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:

Total cost of driving per year = Total miles driven per year * $2/mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. So, the total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = Total cost of driving per year + Total bonus per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that the number of books sold in the first year is x, and the number of books sold in the current year is x/2. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 = 200

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + x = 400

Combine like terms:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since x represents the number of books sold in the first year, we can calculate the number of books sold in the current year as x/2:

x/2 = 133.33/2 = 66.67

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 66 books sold in the current year.

Now, we know that Elise sold 45 books this year. This means that the number of books sold in the first year is 45 + 66 = 111 books.

We can calculate the total amount of money earned in the first year as follows:

Total amount earned in the first year = Number of books sold in the first year * Price per book
= 111 * 20
= 2220

To find the total amount of money earned in the second year, we can subtract the amount earned in the first year from the total amount earned in the first two years:

Total amount earned in the first two years = Total number of books sold in the first two years * Price per book
= 200 * 20
= 4000

Total amount earned in the second year = Total amount earned in the first two years - Total amount earned in the first year

His regular earnings for April would be 200 hours * $10 per hour = $2000.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. So, his total earnings for April would be $2000 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $2300.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that the bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

60 (total loaves) - 40 (morning sales) = 20 loaves.

It's given that half of what's left is sold in the afternoon and evening.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks to find the weight loss per week.

Weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up an equation to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Let's say it takes Sandy 'x' weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up the equation:

2x = 8

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 8 / 2
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population six years ago was:

Population six years ago = 3000N
= 3000(26)
= 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can set up the equation:

Population six years ago = (1/2)Population now
78000 = (1/2)P

We can multiply both sides by 2 to solve for P:

P = 2(78000)
P = 156000

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 156000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

We also know that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys. So, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
= 1/10 * 30
= 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed. 

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can divide 45 by 3 to find the number of electric poles required. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of people at the party initially. 

The total number of people initially is 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

1/4 of 40 people = 40 * 1/4 = 10 people.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30 people.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed:

Number of women left = Total number of people left - Number of men left
= 30 - 22
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since there are 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

Now, let's solve for 'x': 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 3*8 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Now, let's find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 26 + 46 = 72.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find out how many boxes are needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes needed to achieve this cooling effect. 

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling effect / Cooling effect per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:
Total weakening effect of ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening effect per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will directly weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Total weakening effect of cream = 15 milliliters

The total weakening effect of the iced coffee is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:
Total weakening effect = Total weakening effect of ice cubes + Total weakening effect of cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we can say that for every 3 records, 2 are old and 1 is new.

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records as follows:

Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is 7. Since each new record is obtained by trading 2 old records, the total number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. Since each person brings in old records, we need to find out how many old records were brought in by the 5 people.

Let's assume the number of old records brought in by each person is x. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 5x.

We know that the total number of old records traded is 14, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 14 / 5
x = 2.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the number of records must be a multiple of 2 (since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record).

Let's re-examine the problem. If each person brings in 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 5 * 2 = 10. This is indeed a multiple of 2.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 10 old records.

Final answer: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Now, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the total number of people at the third stop.

We know that there were 20 people at the third stop. At the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the number of people at the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people at the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Since the question asks for the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to add the number of people who got in at the first and second stops. Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the total time required to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, Erin's mother gives her 10 more lollipops. 
7 (initial lollipops) + 10 (additional lollipops) = 17 lollipops

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. 
17 (total lollipops) - 3 (lollipops given to Ella) = 14 lollipops

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The customer spent $80 initially.
2. They used their loyalty card rewards, which gave them $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards. So, they got $4 off.
3. However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. This means the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.
4. Now, we need to subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the initial amount. So, we subtract $4 (rewards) and $8 (coupon discount) from $80: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Total number of legs = (number of chickens * 2) + (number of cows * 4)

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

Now, we know that the total change he had initially is $10, and he spent $2 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

We also know that the total cost of the candy is $1.5x. Since he spent $8 on candy, we can set up the equation: $1.5x = $8.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by $1.5: x = $8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get: 45 = 2S - 5.

Now, let's solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: 50/2 = 2S/2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in one trip: 
75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:
18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, Mark will need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For 3 collie beds, Mark will need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark will need 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken to return home
= 3 hours + 3 hours
= 6 hours

"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 students at Small Tree School on Friday.

The question asks for the number of boys, but it doesn't provide the total number of boys. However, we can infer that the total number of boys is the difference between the total number of students and the number of girls:
96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

Now, we can find the number of boys who were present on Friday by subtracting the number of absent boys from the total number of boys:
53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49

Therefore, there were 49 boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of boys in the park. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can multiply the number of girls by 2 to find the number of boys.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
= 2 * 6
= 12

Now that we know there are 12 boys, we can add the number of girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 6 + 12
= 18

Therefore, there are 18 kids in the park.

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points: 42
Points scored so far: 15 + 18 = 33

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. According to the problem, 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5, since you can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifting: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10
Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

So, 5 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before Erin scored 14 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say Sara had x points before Erin scored 14 points. 
Then, Erin had 3x points before scoring 14 points. 
We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation: 
3x + 14 = 14 + 8 (since Erin had 8 points after scoring 14 points)
3x = 22
x = 22 / 3
x = 7.33

So, Sara had approximately 7.33 points before Erin scored 14 points.

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can multiply Sara's points by 3: 
3 * 7.33 = 22. 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to 22 points for Erin before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is: 22"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into several categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   Each frame costs $20, and 20% of that is $4. 
   So, the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Etching: 
   Since 20% of the picture frames need to be etched, that's 20% of 44, which is 0.2 * 44 = 8.8. We'll round down to 8 frames since you can't etch a fraction of a frame. 
   The cost for etching is 8 * $4 = $32.

3. Pins: 
   2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. 
   The total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

4. Cords: 
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 1/4 = 11. 
   The cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$1056 (picture frames) + $32 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1210.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1210."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost
Total cost = $320 + $400
Total cost = $720

The final answer is: $720"

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. The next day, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.
3. On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of pairs sold: 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x. Since 40% of the total number were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces were returned, the company will only be paying for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is 60% of the total cost (100% - 40% = 60%).

The cost of the functioning pieces is 0.6 * $400,000 = $240,000.

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest Karan needs to pay over the 5 months. 

First, we calculate the total interest: 
Total interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Total interest = $3650 * 10% * 5 months
Total interest = $3650 * 0.1 * 5
Total interest = $1825

Since Karan has to pay the principal and the interest, we add the principal to the total interest to get the total amount she needs to pay:
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3650 + $1825
Total amount = $5475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $5475 / 5
Monthly payment = $1095

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1095."

"To determine the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups x $1 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so they will sing with 26 girls.

However, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means that half of the 26 girls will not be able to perform. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 girls will not be able to perform.

The choir's 3 teachers will also sing with them, so we need to add these 3 teachers to the number of girls who can perform. 26 - 13 = 13 girls can perform, and adding the 3 teachers, the total number of people singing is 13 + 3 = 16.

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the cost of buying individual ride tickets for both David and Dasha. 

Since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. 

For 9 rides, the total cost would be 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for David. The ride bracelet costs $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy individual tickets, so his total cost is $30.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying individual tickets for Dasha. As calculated earlier, the cost of 9 rides is $36. 

The total cost for both David and Dasha is $30 (David's ride bracelet) + $36 (Dasha's tickets) = $66.

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since Tim is bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $18 = $42.

The builder earns $50 per day, so his yearly earnings would be 288 * 50 = $14,400.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch.

For the quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe:
- Flour: 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups
- Milk: 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 (bags of flour) - 2 (bottles of milk) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the energy used per day: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we calculate the energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy used to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the energy used per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used and the new energy used: 
7200 watts/day - 2700 watts/day = 4500 watts/day

Now, we calculate the energy saved in 30 days: 
4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135,000 watts

Converting this to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.

The third zebra has 36 stripes.

The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

We also know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

However, we are told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house: 80 corns + 100 cannolis = 180.

The final answer is: 180"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he completed 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He then did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed so far are 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the steps he took during the jog must be the difference between the total steps he needed to take (10,000) and the steps he had completed so far (6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000). 

So, the steps Elliott took during his jog are 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport in 60 + 10 = 70 minutes.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 70 - 30 = 40 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. So, 10 employees left, and 30 employees remained. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: 42000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400, and the second package is twice that much, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Since Tim gets a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $1200. 20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240. 

The discounted price of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Adding the finale firework that costs $150, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12). 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: finding the number of candles that will explode and the number that will smell like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them explode, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of candles that will explode = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles that will explode
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Next, we need to find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles that will smell like wet dog
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

However, we need to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since these are two independent events, we can assume that the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities. 

Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog = 0.05
Probability of a candle exploding = 0.05

Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding = Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog * Probability of a candle exploding
= 0.05 * 0.05
= 0.0025

Now, we can find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:

Number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode = Total number of candles * Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding
= 50000 * 0.0025
= 125

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discounted price of one blouse and then multiply it by 4.

The regular price of one blouse is $20. Since there's a 30% discount, we need to find 30% of $20 and subtract it from $20.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Discounted price of one blouse = $20 - $6 = $14

Now, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost of 4 blouses:

Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: 56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

However, we know that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister does. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, Joanne must gather at least 1 apple from the average trees. 

So, 440 - 3x ≥ 1. 

Simplifying the inequality, we get 3x ≤ 439.

Since x must be a whole number, the maximum value of x is 146.

Now, let's calculate the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees. 

Joanne gathers 440 - 3x = 440 - 3(146) = 440 - 438 = 2 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each camel has 2 heads and each dromedary has 1 head, we can write the equation:

2c + d = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps (or humps) is 304, and since each camel has 2 bumps and each dromedary has 1 bump, we can write the equation:

2c + d = 304

However, these two equations are the same, which means we have an inconsistent system of equations. This is because the two equations are essentially the same, and we cannot find a unique solution.

In this case, we can conclude that the information provided is insufficient to determine the exact number of camels and dromedaries. However, we can express the number of dromedaries in terms of the number of camels:

d = 180 - 2c

Since we cannot find a unique solution, we cannot provide a numerical answer."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break down his journey into segments.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this day.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the lockers' sizes. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb (14,000 feet) and Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet). 

14,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 11,000 feet

Now, let's add the amounts: 
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $14000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $14000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The final 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * (x - 6) = (1/3)x - 2. The total savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6) = (2/3)x + 4.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine the fractions:

(3/3)x = 8
x = 8

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

x + 6 = 8 + 6
x + 6 = 14
x = 8

However, this is the original price of the jogger jeans. We need to find the original price of the tattered jeans, which is x + 6. 

x + 6 = 8 + 6
x + 6 = 14
x + 6 = 14

The original price of the tattered jeans is 14.

Now, we can find the difference in the original prices of the jogger and tattered jeans:

Original price of jogger jeans - original price of tattered jeans = 14 - 8
= 6

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's assume that the store-bought feeders attract x birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract x + 10 birds each.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the store-bought feeders attract x birds each is incorrect. However, we can still solve the problem by assuming that the store-bought feeders attract x birds each and the homemade feeders attract x + 10 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that our initial assumption is correct. Therefore, the store-bought feeders attract x birds each and the homemade feeders attract x + 10 birds each.

Since we know that each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 20

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

10 = 20 - x

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get:

-10 = -x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, the store-bought feeders attract 10 birds each and the homemade feeders attract 20 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(20) = 60 and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3(10) = 30.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 30 = 90.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's assume Kenny starts with x cards.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. He sells these 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, and he has $50 in spending cash. 

We know that 2/3 of the cards sold for $1.5 each will give Kenny $50. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x * 1.5 = 50 * (3/2)
x * 1.5 = 75

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 75 / 1.5
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer needs 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs in total.

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the shortage of 44 hotdogs means 44 / 2 = 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to convert 1/4 of 3 gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 1/4 of 3 gallons is (1/4) * 3 = 0.75 gallons. 

To convert 0.75 gallons to pints, we multiply 0.75 by 8: 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that he spent 99% of his money. We know that he spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. So, 99% of 500 cents is 0.99 * 500 = 495 cents.

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent. 495 cents - 120 cents = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many he bought. 375 cents / 75 cents = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4):

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, we divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total amount of onions and beef stock Antoine needs.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Since the onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box. The total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can plug these values into the formula:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads the sister with fewer beads has from the number of beads the sister with more beads has. 

Since Elizabeth has fewer beads, we subtract her beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Since the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, and the window is open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to find the net change in temperature. The net change is the difference between the temperature increase and the temperature decrease, which is 15 - 6 = 9 degrees.

Since the house was initially 40 degrees, the final temperature will be 40 + 9 = 49 degrees.

Final answer: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Jon's bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
James' bike time: 80 + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Jon's run time: 50 minutes
James' run time: We don't know yet, but we'll call it x minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10
170 = 111 + x
x = 59 minutes

So, James took 59 minutes to complete the run."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 
Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, 
Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance it runs in 30 minutes as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * (30/60) hour
Distance = 16 miles

Now, we know that for every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Since the horse runs 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of $30. To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has:

Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so we need to divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out.

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to compare his score to Marcy's score. 

Joey initially had 214 points. He scored 26 points, so his new score is 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy initially had 225 points. She scored 10 points, so her new score is 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we compare Joey's score to Marcy's score: 240 - 235 = 5 points.

Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors from these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors from these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P and the price of the soda as S. We know that the total cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda. We also know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12.

The cost of the super ticket can be represented as:
20 = 12 + P + S - 1 (since you get one free popcorn and soda with the super ticket)

We are also given that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

So, we can set up the equation:
12 + P + S = 20 + 2

Simplifying the equation:
12 + P + S = 22

Now, we know that the cost of the soda is $3, so we can substitute S = 3 into the equation:
12 + P + 3 = 22

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
P = 7

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Now, two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

To find the cost of filling 170 balloons, we multiply the new cost by 170:

65 * 170 = 11,100

The final answer is: 11,100"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, each worth $800. So, the total value of the sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $6400 + $2400 = $8800.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

60% of 15 red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Since the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors:
Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 24
Number of yellow cards = 39
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes he has:
10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. 

We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means that the remaining one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

To avoid double-counting the kids allergic to both, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts.

Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this amount to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint he has and the number of tubes of yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

The combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of their individual weights: 48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract it from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is $200, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they have earned from their goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

26"
"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since Gabriel can add up to 100 songs, and Luri already has 60 songs, the number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 60 = 40.

The difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60 oranges.

2/5 of 60 oranges = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10.

24 * 10 = 240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

Total miles per week = miles per day * days per week
Total miles per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles per week = 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours by dividing the total miles by his speed:
Total hours per week = Total miles per week / speed
Total hours per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours per week = 6 hours/week

The answer is 6."
"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. Since there are four horses, each consuming 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:

4 horses * 5 pounds/horse * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since Uncle Ben wants to feed his horses for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:

40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this amount. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag:

200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Pomeranians: Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we multiply the total number of puppies by 2/3.
   Total puppies = 27
   Pomeranians = 27 * (2/3) = 18

2. Calculate the number of girl Pomeranians: Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we multiply the number of Pomeranians by 1/3.
   Girl Pomeranians = 18 * (1/3) = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the temperatures: 
-48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Now, let's divide by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take for him to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car.

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Total capacity of the trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs
Total number of eggs Jaime has = 64 eggs

Number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place = Total number of eggs - Total capacity of the trays
= 64 - 48
= 16 eggs

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors. 

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

With the buy one get one free deal, the cost of 2 packs is $4.00 (for the first pack) + $0 (for the second pack) = $4.00. 

Now, applying the $2.00 coupon, the total cost becomes $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25. 

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 * (64"" + 60"") = 3 * 124"" = 372"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 * (64"" + 60"") = 2 * 124"" = 248"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 372"" + 248"" = 876"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 876"" / 12 = 73 feet.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the number of times she got up and walked in 5 days.

Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, she walks 24 times in 5 days. 

Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, we multiply the number of times she walked (24) by the duration of each walk (5 minutes):

24 * 5 = 120 minutes

Charisma walked for 120 minutes in 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. 

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we can write the equation as: 
A + 4 = 3 * (14 + 4)

Simplifying the equation:
A + 4 = 3 * 18
A + 4 = 54

Subtracting 4 from both sides:
A = 50

So, Angela is currently 50 years old.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To determine the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as 'B'. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, and we need to find out how much each pack costs. We also know that she paid $7 in total.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since she bought 2 packs, the total cost of strawberry gum is 2x.

We know that she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $1 for the green apple gum.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x (strawberry gum) + 2 (grape gum) + 1 (green apple gum) = 7

Combine like terms:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For the 2 x 4 lumber, he can get 200 sticks, and it costs $4. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For the 2 x 8 lumber, he can get 400 sticks, and it costs $6. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 is less than $0.02, the 2 x 8 lumber is the cheapest option. 

To find out how many 2 x 8 lumber Frederick can buy with $24, we divide $24 by $6: $24 / $6 = 4. 

Since he can buy 4 2 x 8 lumber, he can get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to first establish the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 120."

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km, 8 laps will be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Therefore, Hannah will need 120 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of money Julie spent on clothes and then subtract that from the initial amount, and then calculate 25% of the remaining amount and subtract that from the result.

Initial amount: $500
Amount spent on clothes: 20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100
Remaining amount: $500 - $100 = $400

Now, we calculate 25% of the remaining amount: 25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100
Amount spent on CDs: $100
Remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The house costs $90,000.

90,000"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Then, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $64 - $32
Profit = $32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total number of minutes in the fight is 5 x 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 x 25 = 375 punches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4.

Suzanne made 36 cookies, so Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time taken by Rob from hours to minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. Double the time taken by Rob is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. 

Adding 40 minutes to this, we get 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate the total number of items she wants to make for her grandchildren.

She wants to make 3 hats, 3 scarves, 3 sweaters, 3 pairs of mittens, and 3 pairs of socks.

For hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
For scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
For sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
For mittens: 3 pairs * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
For socks: 3 pairs * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63

Martha will need 63 skeins of wool to make the winter wear for her grandchildren.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Chris starts with 100 math problems. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. So, he now has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. So, he now has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for red tulips: 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for blue tulips: 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since the rows of red and blue tulips are separate, we need to add the number of rows together: 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her current and future weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 hours = 84 kilowatt-hours per week
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week

Future weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
Future weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 hours = 98 kilowatt-hours per week
Future weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time it would take for 5 people to paint the house as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time to hours:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find out how many chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The final answer is: 108"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how much he spent on the CD.

Tom spent $4 on the CD. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid: 
$48 - $4 = $44

Since the cost of the CD is $4, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought:
$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, the weeks he worked out 5 hours, and the week he worked out 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours, there were 6 weeks. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked out 5 hours, there was 1 week.
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there was 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 more passengers get on the bus, making the total 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old. Therefore, Jame's cousin is currently 15 - 8 = 7 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 5 - 7 = -2 years. However, since age cannot be negative, we can say that Jame is 2 years younger than his cousin.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the total cost of the computer and the printer. 

We know the computer costs $1,100, and the printer costs $400 less than the computer. So, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the 2 monitors. 

$2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. 

$600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that George has 3 candies left after eating 5. This means that before eating, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say George had x candies. Then Nick had 2x candies.

We know that George had 8 candies, so x = 8. 
Now we can find the number of candies Nick had: 
2x = 2 * 8 = 16

So, Nick had 16 candies.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age can be calculated as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know Alyana's age is 6. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age can be calculated as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the bill evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

So, you ended up paying $30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

Final answer: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings first.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. The total amount they have together is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

4x = 4 * 20
4x = 80

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

So, in total, 3 (initial) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys Jonathan needs to have in order to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, the additional commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

So, Antonella's total earnings are $300 (from the first $1000) + $150 (from the additional $1500) = $450.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. Then, we multiply this time by 3 to find the time it takes to swim 3 miles: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake as follows:

Octavia's daily coffee intake = 1/2 * daily recommended amount
Octavia's daily coffee intake = 1/2 * 4 cups
Octavia's daily coffee intake = 2 cups

Juan's current coffee intake = 10 * Octavia's daily coffee intake
Juan's current coffee intake = 10 * 2 cups
Juan's current coffee intake = 20 cups

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we can calculate the amount he needs to reduce as follows:

Amount to reduce = Juan's current coffee intake - daily recommended amount
Amount to reduce = 20 cups - 4 cups

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the new angle. 

The sun moves 5 degrees an hour, and it moves for 10 hours. So, the change in the angle is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Now, we subtract the change in the angle from the initial angle to get the new angle: 32 degrees - 50 degrees = -18 degrees.

However, since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 degrees to get the equivalent positive angle: -18 degrees + 360 degrees = 342 degrees.

But, since the angle is measured from the ground, we need to subtract the angle from 180 degrees to get the angle from the ground to the sun: 180 degrees - 342 degrees = -162 degrees.

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 degrees to get the equivalent positive angle: -162 degrees + 360 degrees = 198 degrees.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 198 degrees.

Final answer: 198"
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to first find out how many candles James needs. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him and 8 candles for the younger son. 

The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost will be 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 per day for 3 days, which is $5 * 3 = $15. He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will spend $2 per day for 3 days, which is $2 * 3 = $6. He has $55 left, so he will have $55 - $6 = $49.

Since he buys plastic action figures for $2 each, he can buy $49 / $2 = 24.5 plastic action figures. However, since you can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 24 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add the wooden action figures he bought from Sunday to Wednesday (3) and the plastic action figures he bought from Thursday to Saturday (24). The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 3 + 24 = 27.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of cups, we add Judy's cups and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

To find the total number of dishes, we add Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.1 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he also earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns from both activities.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we need to add 5 words to 52, which is 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

The final answer is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

For the Cheerios option: 
Weight lost per week = -1.25 pounds
Total weight lost in 5 weeks = -1.25 * 5 = -6.25 pounds

For the donuts option:
Weight gained per week = 1.75 pounds
Total weight gained in 5 weeks = 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options = Total weight gained - Total weight lost
= 8.75 - (-6.25)
= 8.75 + 6.25
= 15 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends. So, the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. This means 8 more people will be attending.

Now, we add the total number of people: 
- Initial guests: 100
- Additional guests from the initial invitations: 200
- Additional guests from Alex's friends: 8
- Alex's friends: 10

Total number of people attending the event: 100 + 200 + 8 + 10 = 318

Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the point at which the beanstalk's height exceeds Mark's window height. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since it doubles every day, we can calculate its height on each subsequent day:

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
Day 4: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

Since 64 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to find the weekly amount:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and subtract the deposit he's already paid.

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.
The additional cost for the porcelain crown is $500.
The total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount he needs by his hourly wage:

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Adding these amounts together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money Colby has by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve buys each year and add the 5 games he receives as a gift.

Year 1: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games.
- He receives 5 games as a gift, so 12 + 5 = 17 games.

Year 2: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games.
- He receives 5 games as a gift, so 12 + 5 = 17 games.

Year 3: 
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 2 * 12 = 24 games.
- He receives 5 games as a gift, so 24 + 5 = 29 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the plane is traveling. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the rate, we can use it to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates each person makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total amount earned.
$30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven in a month to find the total number of rotations per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

To find the total number of rotations in a year, we multiply this by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * 60
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump (in cents) = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 1200 cents

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before tax, then apply the discount, and finally add the sales tax.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:
- Shirt: $25
- Shorts: $35
Total cost before tax: $25 + $35 = $60

Next, we apply the 30% discount:
Discount amount: 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18
Total cost after discount: $60 - $18 = $42

Now, we need to add the sales tax. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8%:
Sales tax amount: 8% of $42 = 0.08 * $42 = $3.36
Total cost after tax: $42 + $3.36 = $45.36

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial budget:
$50 - $45.36 = $4.64

Joe will have $4.64 left after the purchase."

3. He also chews 1 piece after dinner, so now he has 5 + 1 = 6 pieces.

4. Since he has 20 pieces initially, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces remaining.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

6. Finally, he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x $14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

Then, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5: 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers.

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week. Total = 30 + 24 = 54.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his annual growth rate (2 inches).

First, let's convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James also got a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James' total earnings are $175,000 (profit) + $17,500 (commission) = $192,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get 25 riders.

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 to get 15 women.

Now, we need to find out how many men can stay upright. We subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: 4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, so S = 16.

We also know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Lastly, we know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to consider the direction of the relative speed. In this case, we can say that Tom is moving at a relative speed of 15 mph in the opposite direction of Bob.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find the number of fish Tommy caught, we can add 3 to Darren's fish.

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the maximum amount Manny can afford to miss classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. 

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the classes. 

Let x be the number of classes Manny can miss. The total cost of the classes will be the initial cost of the classes ($60) plus the cost of the classes he misses (10x). 

We know that the total number of classes is 10, so the number of classes Manny attends will be 10 - x. 

The total cost of the classes can be represented as: 
60 + 10x

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we can set up the inequality:
60 + 10x ≤ 10(10 - x)

Simplifying the inequality, we get:
60 + 10x ≤ 100 - 10x
Combine like terms:
20x ≤ 40
Divide both sides by 20:
x ≤ 2

So, Manny can miss up to 2 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of customers Jewel processes in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly production. 

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers in a day. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed by both in a day is 50 + 100 = 150.

The total weekly production for the two is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The cost of the running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from red hats in the first month would be G/2.

We know that the total sales from red hats in the first month is $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find the total sales from green hats in the first month, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

Now, we know that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. The total sales of the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is 400 + 800 = 1200.

The sales in the second month would be 3/4 of 1200:

(3/4) * 1200 = 900

Now, we need to find the total amount she made in two months. We add the sales from the first and second months:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the equation:

s + g = 20 (since each animal has one head)

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can set up another equation:

4s + 2g = 70

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 's' by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' the same in both equations:

2s + 2g = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'g':

(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Since John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, we can divide the total class time by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns:
Number of recipes = Total class time / 1.5
= 48 hours / 1.5
= 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply 40% by the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has initially.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

If they decide to share the money equally among themselves, each person will get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the additional 5 minutes for the extended quarter.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes. Adding the 5 extra minutes for the extended quarter, the total game length is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are both management and oversee the company.

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of these management employees who oversee the company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

"To find out how much candy each person would have, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 
Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we divide the total amount by 3 (the number of people).
12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds.

So, each person would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of days that were either good or bad. We know that Christina had 12 good days and 8 bad days, so the total number of days that were either good or bad is 12 + 8 = 20.

We also know that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This means that the remaining days (30 - 8 - 8 - 8 = 6) were neutral.

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that the total number of good days is 12 + 3 = 15.

However, we need to consider the fact that the first eight days were good, and the next three days were good. This means that the good days in the first 11 days (8 + 3 = 11) are already accounted for. Therefore, the remaining good days are 15 - 11 = 4.

So, the number of good days left in the month is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he returned, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 24 dogs now. Since James already had 12 toys, he needed 12 more toys to meet the new requirement.

But then, 3 dogs were gone, leaving 21 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 21 toys.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money each person invested, we need to follow the order of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left for Skyler's investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

So, Skyler's investment was 240 dollars.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So, the total number of signatures they have collected is 20 + 44 = 64.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

Final answer: 576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then add the number of cookies Katarina and Summer have.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 
68 + 5 = 73 cookies for Max.

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 
73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's total: 
73 + 23 = 96 cookies for Summer.

Now, we can add up the total number of cookies that Katarina, Max, and the Cookie Monster have: 
68 + 73 + 61 = 202 cookies.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

Let's start with the ""turtle"" mode. Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's look at the ""rabbit"" mode. Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so he can mow half the lawn in 20 minutes.

To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked together: 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract 10 from the total number of cookies: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

The total age of the twins and triplets would be the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplets. Since there are two twins and three triplets, the total age would be 2x + 3(x + 7).

We are given that their combined ages are 44. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3(x + 7) = 44

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 3x + 21 = 44

Combine like terms:

5x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

5x = 23

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 4.6

Since 'x' represents the age of the younger twin, the age of one of the twins is 4.6 years.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Since John has 180 minutes before dinner, we subtract the time he has for homework from the total time:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong saves per year. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

Now, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves per year. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we can calculate it as follows:
2/5 * 240 = 96
So, Neil saves 240 + 96 = 336 coins per year.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins they save in 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360

Now, let's add their total savings together:

"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the total bill includes the cost of vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check, we can set up the equation:
0.6x = $40 + x

To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides:
0.6x - x = $40
-0.4x = $40
Divide both sides by -0.4:
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find out how much John leaves with:
$125 (initial amount) - $100 (total bill) = $25

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

Since we already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, the total number of chairs Mia has is 8 + 40 = 48.

To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of people:

Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
Amount still needed = $6300 - $2100
Amount still needed = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly amount to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours = Amount still needed / Hourly amount
Number of hours = $4200 / $700 (since $2100 was raised in 3 hours, we can assume the hourly amount is $700)
Number of hours = 6

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because the city can't use a negative percentage of the river's water.

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. Since 80% of the 40% is used for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage is used for non-industrial purposes.

Let's find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes:

40% (total used by the city) * (1 - 0.8) = 40% * 0.2 = 8%

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, its rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, its rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total rate at which the factory makes ice cream. To do this, we add the rates of chocolate and vanilla ice cream: 50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts.

The total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts.

"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Now, we apply the 10% discount. 10% of $50.00 is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, we can calculate the cost of 3 scoops as follows:

3 scoops = 2 scoops (cost) + 1 scoop (free)
Cost of 3 scoops = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford 3 scoops of ice cream."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much candy each person eats in two weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 14 days. 

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 100 people applied for the job, and 30% of them received interviews. 

Number of people who received interviews = 100 * 0.3 = 30

Next, we know that 20% of those who received interviews received a job offer.

Number of people who received a job offer = 30 * 0.2 = 6

Finally, we know that a third of those who received a job offer accepted the position.

Number of people who accepted the position = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, 2 people accepted the position.

"To find the total amount of rice Goldy gave away, we need to calculate the total number of sacks she gave away and then multiply it by the weight of each sack.

Goldy gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, the total weight of rice given away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

"To find the total number of taps Helga made, we need to calculate the number of taps she made with her feet during the 5 minutes, considering the two scenarios: with her arms raised and without her arms raised.

When her arms are raised, she taps her feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute per foot. So, the total taps per minute with her arms raised is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. 

Since her arms are raised for 2 minutes, she taps her feet 2 * 400 = 800 times.

When her arms are not raised, she taps her feet at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. 

Since her arms are not raised for 3 minutes, she taps her feet 3 * 550 = 1650 times.

The total number of taps Helga made is 800 + 1650 = 2450.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since we are looking for the amount saved, we should consider the negative value as a loss, not a savings. 

Therefore, Ron actually loses $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

Now, let's subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 5 pizzas, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices per pizza, they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices in total.

The remaining friends (2 friends) ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices per pizza, they ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices in total.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten: 8 (by Bryce and two friends) + 9 (by the remaining friends) = 17 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total: 60 - 17 = 43.

Therefore, there are 43 slices of pizza left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat, which is 9, and it takes 2/3 the time the cat takes, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. To do this, we add the time taken by both and divide by 2:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

The average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many people voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people voted, we multiply 5000 by 2/5.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000

So, 2000 people voted by midday. The remaining people are:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we need to find out how many people voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people voted, we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000

So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00. The total number of people who voted by 16:00 is:

2000 (voted by midday) + 2000 (voted by 16:00) = 4000

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00. We subtract the total number of people who voted from the initial number of people.

Total number of smores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required: 24 / 8 = 3

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand.

= 30

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, so candidate B received 20 + (0.50 * 20) = 30 votes.

Since the total number of voters is 100, we can subtract the votes received by candidate A and candidate B from the total to find the number of votes received by candidate C.

Votes received by candidate C = Total votes - (Votes received by candidate A + Votes received by candidate B)

Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, let's calculate the number of apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples:

Beck's apples after receiving 10 = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's apples after receiving 10 = 77 + 10
Beck's apples after receiving 10 = 87

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris's remaining apples:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Cal has as C, Sean has as S, and Carl has as C.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = C/2. Since S = 56, we can set up the equation 56 = C/2.

To find the value of C, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us C = 112.

Now that we know Cal has 112 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can set up the equation C = 4S. Substituting S = 56, we get C = 4 * 56 = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles each of them has: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and 12 groups, we divide 54 by 12.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

So, we need 5 groups to accommodate all 54 students.

However, the question asks for the number of groups needed to form, not the number of groups already formed. Since we already have 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

To do this, we subtract the number of groups already formed from the total number of groups required.

12 (already formed) - 12 (required) = 0

"To find the monthly share of each roommate, we need to divide the total bill by the number of roommates. 

Total bill per month = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total bill per month / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Since we want to find the yearly share, we multiply the monthly share by 12.

Yearly share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $25 * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he had, and then subtract the number of broken ones.

Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. He also sent 4 dozen plates, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken, so we subtract 10 from the initial number of glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.

Similarly, 6 plates were broken, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total: 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128.

Jeff now has 128 glasses and plates.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the information given. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor would be 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up another equation:
2/3 * Total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total puppies = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has ($70) to the money Ava gave him ($45):

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. So, she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Additionally, she earns $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Since she teaches 2 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday would be $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
$65 + $30 = $95

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet earns from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means Bennet needs to earn $75 from selling corn. He has 25 ears of corn, so we need to divide $75 by 25 to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for.

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles: 
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, let's add the total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles: 
228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Since Henry has 650 wheels in the box, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since Mike has 600 movies and a third of them are in series, we can calculate the number of movies in series as follows:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, and a normal movie costs $10, the cost of the series would be:
200 * $10 = $2000.

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies would be:
600 - 200 = 400 movies.

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, the total cost of the older movies would be:
160 * $5 = $800.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
The total cost would be the sum of the cost of the series and the cost of the older movies:

We also know that they hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

Their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Emma's score is 10x (for the enemies) + 15 (for the berries) + 30 * (60 - t) (for the time, where t is the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level).

Ava's score is 10(x + 8) (for the enemies) + 12 (for the berries) + 30 * (60 - (t + 4)) (for the time, where t is the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level).

Since the time left on the timer is the same for both players, we can set up an equation:

10x + 15 + 30 * (60 - t) = 10(x + 8) + 12 + 30 * (60 - (t + 4))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 15 + 1800 - 30t = 10x + 80 + 1800 - 30t - 120

Combine like terms:

15 + 1800 - 30t = 80 + 1800 - 30t - 120

Combine constants:

1795 - 30t = 1760 - 30t

Subtract 1760 from both sides:

35 - 30t = -30t

Add 30t to both sides:

35 = 5t

Divide both sides by 5:

7 = t

Now that we know the time left on the timer, we can calculate the scores.

Emma's score is 10x + 15 + 30 * 60 = 10x + 15 + 1800 = 10x + 1815.

Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 12 + 30 * 56 = 10x + 80 + 1680 = 10x + 1760.

Now we can set up an equation to find the value of x:

10x + 1815 = 10x + 1760

Subtract 10x from both sides:

1815 = 1760

This equation is not true, which means we made an incorrect assumption about the number of enemies Emma jumped on. However, we can still find the difference in scores.

The difference in scores is A - E = (10x + 1760) - (10x + 1815) = -55.

The final answer is -55."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's assume that x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W. Since he had 4 white fish initially, the number of white fish he has now is W = 4 + (17 - x).

We know that the number of orange fish he has now is 3 - x. Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2W
3 - x = 2(4 + 17 - x)
3 - x = 2(21 - x)
3 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 39

So, 39 orange fish were taken out of the tank. Since the total number of fish taken out was 17, the number of white fish taken out is 17 - 39 = -22, which again, is not possible. This means our initial assumption that x = 39 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the number of white fish he has now is twice the number of orange fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W and the number of orange fish as O. We can set up the equation:

W = 2O
W = 2(3 - x)
W = 6 - 2x

We also know that the total number of fish he has now is 7 + 17 = 24. So, the total number of fish is the sum of white and orange fish:

W + O = 24
(6 - 2x) + (3 - x) = 24
9 - 3x = 24
3x = -15
x = 5

So, 5 orange fish were taken out of the tank. The number of white fish taken out is 17 - 5 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to first calculate the total miles he drives per week. Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost per week = $15

Carrie also spent all the quarters, which is 140 quarters. Since each quarter is $0.25, the total amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent on the lunch is the sum of the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters, which is $120 + $35 = $155.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to heat up the house to the freezing point.

The temperature difference between the day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the house needs to be heated up to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing, and each log heats up the house by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is heated up to the desired temperature. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply that by the number of days.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25
Number of days: 30

Total amount of money per day: 10 * $0.25 = $2.50
Total amount of money in 30 days: $2.50 * 30 = $75

Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her overtime pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours of overtime, her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. So, her overtime pay is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 (regular pay) + $90 (overtime pay) = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, there are 32 lions in the enclosure.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

Final answer: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months can be calculated as follows:

- After one month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
- After two months: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000
- After three months: 260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000."
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" twice = 2 * 150 seconds = 300 seconds
Time for ""Jingle Bells"" once = 240 seconds
Total time = 300 + 240 = 540 seconds

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wage of both Billy and Sally, and then find the difference in their earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting hourly wage is $10.50. Since she also works 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

Billy's total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers: 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 14 days. So, she plays 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relative motion of the two cars. Since they are moving in the same direction, we can calculate the relative speed between them by subtracting the speed of the first car from the speed of the second car.

Relative speed = Speed of the second car - Speed of the first car
Relative speed = 70 mph - 60 mph
Relative speed = 10 mph

Now, we need to find the distance that will separate them after 2 hours. We can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

Since we have the relative speed, we can use it to find the distance that will separate them after 2 hours.

Distance = Relative speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, 20 miles will separate the two cars.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice the number of fourth-graders who passed, so it is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The school's overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can divide the total number of square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

By the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

By the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

By the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

By the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

The number of additional students who joined above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 320 - 10 = 310.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows in the bag. After using 18 marshmallows, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

However, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they have 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2, since there are two kids. 

14 S'mores / 2 kids = 7 S'mores per kid.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's assume the cost per game is $0.25 (1 quarter).

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per game, he played 240 / 20 = 12 games.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so he played 240 / 2 = 120 minutes, which is 6 games.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so he played 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes, which is 18 games.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Jack played 12 games, so he spent 12 * $0.25 = $3.
His friend who is significantly worse played 6 games, so he spent 6 * $0.25 = $1.50.
His friend who is significantly better played 18 games, so he spent 18 * $0.25 = $4.50.

The total cost is $3 + $1.50 + $4.50 = $9.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We are given the following information:
1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given information into the equation, we get:
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
S + O + F + S + S = 10 (since S = G and Z = F)
2S + O + F + F = 10
2S + O + 2F = 10

Now, we can substitute O = 2S into the equation:
2S + 2S + 2F = 10
4S + 2F = 10

We also know that O = 2S and S = G, so we can substitute these into the original equation S + O + F + Z + G = 10:
S + 2S + F + S + S = 10
4S + F = 10

Now we have two equations:
4S + 2F = 10
4S + F = 10

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
F = 0

Since F = 0, we can substitute this into the equation 4S + F = 10:
4S + 0 = 10
4S = 10
S = 10/4
S = 2.5

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2 * 2.5
O = 5

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20% of 40. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which equals 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars. 

In total, Joe has sold and given away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find Roy's savings, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings.
40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

Now, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. 

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k'. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total speed of the 3 kangaroos as 1 highway unit per 18 hours. 

Now, if we denote the speed of a turtle as 't', and we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, then the speed of a turtle is 't = k/2'. 

Since there are 4 turtles, the total speed of the 4 turtles is 4t = 4(k/2) = 2k.

We know that the total speed of the 3 kangaroos is 1 highway unit per 18 hours. Therefore, the total speed of the 4 turtles is also 1 highway unit per 18 hours, since they are covering the same distance.

Now, we can set up the equation: 2k = 1/18.

To find the speed of a kangaroo, we can solve for k: k = 1/(2*18) = 1/36.

Now, we can find the speed of a turtle: t = k/2 = (1/36)/2 = 1/72.

Since the speed of a turtle is 1/72 highway units per hour, it will take 72 hours for 4 turtles to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many clay dishes each person made.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. So, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes they all made together: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she also received $150 for her part-time job. Her mom is giving her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount Erika has in her purse as 'x'. We know that the total amount she has is $400 (from the trade-in) + $150 (from her job) + $80 (from her mom) + x (the amount in her purse). 

We also know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up the equation: 
x + 150 + 80 + x = 450

Combine like terms:
2x + 230 = 450

Subtract 230 from both sides:
2x = 220

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 110

So, Erika has $110 in her purse."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam initially had and then subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
So, the total number of apple slices Adam initially had is 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much milk the farmer currently produces. Since he extracts 5 liters a day from 3 cows, we can calculate the amount of milk one cow produces per day.

5 liters/day ÷ 3 cows = 1.67 liters/cow/day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can divide the desired amount of milk by the amount one cow produces per day.

25 liters ÷ 1.67 liters/cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have.

15 cows - 3 cows = 12 cows

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 millimeters.
The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

Final answer: 5600"
"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract it from the price of the hat.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying 60 by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 120 by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 240 socks. Since Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying 60 by 2.

60 * 2 = 120 dishes

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 120 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 60 and 120.

60 + 120 = 180 dishes

To find the total number of socks and dishes, we add 240 socks and 180 dishes.

240 + 180 = 420

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 420."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90, or 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room: 45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Since you are 3 years younger than your brother, your brother's age is x + 3. You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is x - 2.

Now, let's express your mom's age in terms of your brother's age: your mom's age is 3 * (x + 3) - 1.

The sum of your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3 * (x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 4x + 9 + 3x + 8 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 7x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 7x = 70.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 10.

So, you are 10 years old.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. So, Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, Amber earns 12 * 1/2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of books Fawn has as 'x'. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can represent the number of books Anne has as 'x - 12'. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so the number of books Sofie has can be represented as 'x - 12 + 25', which simplifies to 'x + 13'.

We are given that together, they have 85 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85.

Combine like terms: 3x + 1 = 85.

1/4 * 80 = 20

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total:
80 - 20 = 60

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens will be:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total cost of the chickens, we need to subtract the desired profit from the total revenue:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, to find the cost of one chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens:

$7000 / 180 = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for approximately $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the old rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the old rope. Since the rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will receive is:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah needs 20 meters. The total cost of the new rope is:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the old rope:

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age means 3 times her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24 years. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

Final answer: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chicken: 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon, will be 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, will be 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, let's calculate the cost of the apples: 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, will be 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, it seems that Kelly has overspent her budget."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert is 2x. 

We know that the final concert, including the 15-minute encore, runs for 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

2x = 50

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 25

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys: 200
Toys given away: 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now: 200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day, so the total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so it makes 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on the three days: 250 (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) + 250 (Fridays) = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

500"
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be paired. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones is x. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, 80% of the microphones can be paired. 

We know that the total number of microphones is 50. So, 80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs: 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, we have 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
Then, we have 2/3 of 6 birds flying overhead, which is (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds.
Lastly, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Now, let's add them together: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds.

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

15"
"To find the number of indoor plants, we first need to calculate one-fourth of 100 plants. 

One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25.

So, there are 25 indoor plants. 

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants. 

100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. 

Two-thirds of 75 is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants. 

75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit. 

We know that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of one carrot, we first need to determine the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, which is $3. So, the total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by the number of carrots Ellen eats, which is 2. 

$2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

Mark makes $480 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + (3 * 6) + (5 * 6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total monthly hours are 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

Profit = Total monthly income - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had initially.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number:

12 - 2 = 10

Therefore, Martha now has 10 more notebooks than Joseph.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pages Denise read today and compare it to the number of pages Daniel read yesterday.

Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages. Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages yesterday.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 pages. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read. 

Denise read 18 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so in total Denise read 18 + 18 = 36 pages. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so in total Daniel read 13 pages.

Now, subtracting the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read, we get 36 - 13 = 23.

Therefore, Denise read 23 more pages than Daniel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the number of red shoeboxes used by Tim. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of red shoeboxes used = Total number of red shoeboxes * 1/3
= 9 * 1/3
= 3

Now, we know that Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes as well. To find the number of blue shoeboxes left, we subtract the number used from the total number of blue shoeboxes:

Number of blue shoeboxes left = Total number of blue shoeboxes - Number of blue shoeboxes used
= 7 - 3
= 4

To find the total number of shoeboxes left, we need to subtract the number of red and blue shoeboxes used from the total number of shoeboxes:

Total number of shoeboxes left = Total number of blue shoeboxes + Total number of red shoeboxes - (Number of blue shoeboxes used + Number of red shoeboxes used)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, let's calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since an extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the following equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

y = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in 30 days.

Distance driven per day = 100 miles
Number of days = 30

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total distance driven = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total distance driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed.

Number of tune-ups = Total distance driven / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by the girls. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since the girls had the same amount of allowance, let's call the allowance 'x'. The total amount of money they had is 2x. Since they spent $28, we can set up the equation 2x = 28.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. x = 28 / 2 = 14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea Lana has left after creating equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. Since she has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, each row will have 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she brews equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, she will have 9 cups of each type of tea in each row. 

Now, she uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 3 rows, she will use 3 rows for cinnamon tea. This means she will use 3 * 9 = 27 cups for cinnamon tea. However, she only has 27 cups in total, so she must have used all the cups for cinnamon tea.

Since she has 9 cups of each type of tea in each row, and she has used all the cups for cinnamon tea, the problem statement is inconsistent. Lana cannot brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea with 27 cups of tea."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up), we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of round trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. 

8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips

Since the sloth makes a round trip (down and back up), we need to multiply the number of round trips by 2 to find the total number of trips. 

2 round trips * 2 = 4 trips

Now, we need to find the total number of berries the sloth can pick in 4 trips. We know the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the number of berries per trip. 

24 berries / 4 trips = 6 berries per trip

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to calculate how many gallons are emptied in 6 days. 

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining amount.

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $16 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

However, Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he can only see 13 - 5 = 8 more movies.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Total toys she already had: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the third equation: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of P from the third equation into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of balloons each person initially had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 water balloons, so they had 2 * 4 = 8 balloons in total. Maria had 1 balloon for herself, so the total number of balloons initially was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial total number of balloons (9) to the additional balloons given by Maria's mom (15). The total number of balloons is 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated and the total number of boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Total boxes: 50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed = Total boxes / 2 = 60 boxes / 2 = 30 tables

Since they already own 15 tables, we need to subtract this from the total number of tables needed to find the number of new tables required.

New tables needed = 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 40,800 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 40,800 widgets * $6/widget = $244,800

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue of the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $244,800 = $14,400

Therefore, Fern will make $14,400 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month.

14,400"
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 24-hour stay. The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

The amount saved by choosing the 12-hour stay over the 24-hour stay is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate the amount of money John has left after buying gas:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

Now, let's calculate the amount of money John has left after buying pencils:
250 dollars - 50 dollars (5 pencils * 10 dollars each) = 200 dollars

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
200 dollars / 25 dollars per pen = 8 pens

The answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. 

Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters Craig has spelled is 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters they've spelled after the ten rounds. To do this, we add the total number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled.

Total number of letters = 300 (Craig) + 350 (Craig's brother) = 650.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has. Since the teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has is 9 * 100 = 900.

The teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles the teacher had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

Final answer: 842"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into three components: the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. Fixed charge: $40
2. Labor charge: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75
3. Parts charge: $60

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total cost = $40 + $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

Now, let's calculate how much money James made from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent. 
$90 (what he spent) - $200 (what he made) = -$110.

James was out $110.

The value of the yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.
The value of the sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.
The value of the carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has. 

We know that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. Since Sam had 70 loaves of bread, we can set up the equation:

Bakery loaves = 7 * 70 - 40

First, we multiply 7 by 70:
7 * 70 = 490

Then, we subtract 40 from the result:
490 - 40 = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

1. B = A + 20
2. B = D + 10
3. B + A + D = 45

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation, and then substitute the second equation into the third equation as well.

(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time spent stapling reports. 

First, we need to find the total hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to convert 15 hours into minutes. 
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes. 
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by 30 reports. 
60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the total time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total time.

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep while sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes.

Now, we add the time she was asleep while sleepwalking to the time she was awake before sleepwalking and the time she was awake after waking up.

475 minutes (asleep) + 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 5 minutes (waking up early) = 503 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups
Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. 

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 200.

The hospital receives 50 new patients each day due to the coronavirus outbreak. 

In 2 weeks (14 days), the hospital will receive 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (new patients) = 900 beds.

Now, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 (total capacity) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 unoccupied beds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as 'x'. 

We know that the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. 
The total number of holes dug by the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.
The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 23 + 8 = 31.

However, the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 31 - 2 = 29.

We are also given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. 
So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

- Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.
- The other person got 15 more corn chips than the number the others got.

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, the number of corn chips the third person got is 70 + 15 = 85.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips each person got. 

Total corn chips = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips
Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: X = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

We are also given that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: X + S + A = 339.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + A = 339.

Combine like terms: 2S + A + 5 = 339.

Substitute the second equation into the previous one: 2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339.

Expand the equation: 8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird initially flew south for 300 miles and then flew north for 36 miles, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird's southern home is 264 miles south of her northern home.

The final answer is: 264"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies from her office party.
Her friends gave her 4 dozen (48) brownies for the surprise party.
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.
Now, subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

48"
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the prices of the phones. 

The first phone costs $600.
The second phone also costs $600.
The third phone costs half of $600, which is $300.
The fourth phone also costs half of $600, which is $300.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1,600

So, John paid $1,600 for all the phones.

1,600"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in both teams:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13
= 33

Therefore, there are 33 players in both teams combined.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10) 
Perimeter = 2 * 25 
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2 
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2 
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 20 = 40 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she gave away is 40 + 40 = 80.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60. So, she kept 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept and gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of 50, which is 25. Then, we add 4 to get 29.

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA (50) and India (29) to get the total number of states in both countries together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Richard has x cherries. 
Then, Robert has x + 10 cherries. 
We know that Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 30
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 
x = 20
So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 
To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 
60 - 50 = 10
So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries: 
30 - 10 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box. So, the total earnings for gingerbread are 25 * $6 = $150, and the total earnings for apple pie are 26 * $15 = $390.

The total earnings for two days are $150 + $390 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen to last her entire vacation.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 is 0.4 x $100 = $40.

The price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant, considering the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them:
- Each plant takes up 12 inches
- There is 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between each plant
- Total space required for each plant, including space between, is 12 + 18 = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space required for each plant:
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
44 - 17 = 27 more flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is:
30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 (monthly income) - $500 (monthly savings) = $1,500 (monthly expenses)

There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide her monthly expenses by 12 to find out how much she can afford to spend on shoes per year.

$1,500 / 12 = $125 per month

Now, we can divide the amount she can afford to spend on shoes per month by the cost of each pair to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year.

$125 / $1,000 = 0.125 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

0.125 * 12 = 1.5 pairs per year

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

1.5 pairs ≈ 1 pair per year

However, this calculation only accounts for the monthly expenses and doesn't take into account any potential savings or income changes. In reality, Jessica might be able to buy more shoes if she saves more or earns a higher income.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two steps: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes
3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling effect on high and the cooling effect on low:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees in 2 hours.

The final temperature is the initial temperature minus the net cooling effect minus the warming effect:
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 6 degrees - 4 degrees = Initial temperature - 10 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a difference from the initial temperature. Let's call the initial temperature 'x'. 

The final temperature is x - 10 degrees.

The question asks how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is. Since the final temperature is x - 10 degrees, it is 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 2 = 150 years (since Bill saw the comet twice).

Now, we know that Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time. Since his dad was 30 years old when Bill saw the comet for the first time, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

We also know that 150 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet for the first time. So, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:

x + 150 = 90

Subtracting 150 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 90 - 150
x = -60

However, age cannot be negative, so this solution doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the information given. We know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when Bill saw the comet for the first time, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

We also know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Since Bill saw the comet for the second time 75 years after he saw it for the first time, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:

x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 3 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, and it's half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

We know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * x = 3/4 * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, the number of flights to France and Germany combined is 88 - 66 = 22.

Since they are split equally, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. 

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

2. Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We are given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

3. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10 years.

4. Now, we know the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (3), Alessandro (4), and Helene (10). We can write the equation: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.

5. Solving for W, we get: 17 + W = 20, W = 20 - 17, W = 3.

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3 years.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount collected, not just Walter's contributions.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far.

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we can assume that the total amount collected will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as the total amount collected. So, the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cookies were given to the church. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6, which means x = 2. 

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The total number of slices is 6, and the number of slices for the adults is 4. 

To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (number of slices for adults / total number of slices) * 100
= (4 / 6) * 100
= 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (total spent) = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Final answer: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter, and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by that number.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars sold / Total boxes sold
= 64 / 8
= 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly earnings:
- The dance studio is rented 3 days a week, so the rental cost per week is $25 * 3 = $75.
- There are 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. So, the total cost per week for the students is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
- The total weekly earnings are the sum of the rental cost and the cost for the students, which is $75 + $15 = $90.

Monthly earnings:
- Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the monthly earnings would be $90 * 4 = $360.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360.

360"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each box. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We know that this total is 64, so we can set up the equation 4x = 64.

Solving for x, we get x = 64 / 4 = 16.

Now, we know that Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x. We know that this total is 56, so we can set up the equation 7x = 56.

Solving for x, we get x = 56 / 7 = 8.

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each box (16 for Peter and 8 for Martha), we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box. 

The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

Final answer: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by the formula: 

Volume = length * width * height

Given the dimensions of the pool, we can plug in the values as follows:

Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company wants to know the volume in gallons, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons. There are approximately 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot. 

Volume (gallons) = 1400 * 7.48
Volume (gallons) = 10392 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed:

Total gallons = 10392 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61328 gallons

The cost of filling the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = 61328 * 0.10
Total cost = 6132.80

The final answer is: 6132.80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of blue sticks first. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we are told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we have the number of red sticks (9), blue sticks (14), and yellow sticks (11). To find the total number of sticks, we add these numbers together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we know that the total number of male students is the sum of male students over 16 years old and male students under 16 years old: 375 + 750 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
10 - 5 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% of x) * 5
= x - 0.09x * 5
= x - 0.45x
= 0.55x

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
= 0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
= 0.55x - 0.1025x
= 0.4475x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x ≈ 0.625

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.5%.

The final answer is: 62.5"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly income is $400 + $15 * 40 = $400 + $600 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 20% of $10000 is $2000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly income of $1000. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far.

He has purchased 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He has purchased 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He has purchased 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He has purchased 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, we get $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. Since he can't spend a negative amount of money, this means he has actually spent more than he has.

However, if we consider the initial question, Jamaar can't buy any plums because he has spent more than he has.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first determine how many minutes it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read. 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals. The earnings from large stuffed animals are x * $12, and the earnings from small stuffed animals are 2x * $4. The total earnings are given as $120.

So, we can set up the equation: x * $12 + 2x * $4 = $120.

Combine like terms: 12x + 8x = 120

Combine the x terms: 20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20: x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the other individuals. 

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we need to subtract the 10 unaccounted eggs from the total number of eggs. 

The total number of eggs is 100. So, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Therefore, the friends found 90 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's analyze the given information:

- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.

We can set up a proportion to find the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches. 

Let x be the price of the third package. The ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is constant for all three packages. So, we can set up the following proportion:

2/3 = 4/6 = 8/x

We can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides by 2:

1/3 = 2/x

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $6.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of balloons Sally had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Sally then found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's count the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: In this case, Marcus has to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 60% (normal teacher doesn't give an extension) = 30%.

2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 40% (normal teacher gives an extension) = 20%.

3. The whole class gets an extension: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 20% (whole class gets an extension) = 10%.

4. The whole class gets an extension, and Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 20% (whole class gets an extension) * 20% (Marcus convinces the teacher) = 10%.

Now, we add up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework: 30% + 10% = 40%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack, which is 8. 

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

Final answer: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000/year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the fabric is calculated by multiplying the length and width, so the area is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America: 26
Number of cities in each country: 5
Population of each city: 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city

Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet + 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches, Xavier's new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches, which equals 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person's share is approximately $576.67.

"To find the total hours of work, we first need to calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked for 3/8ths of a day each day, we need to convert this to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the total hours worked per day by the total number of days: 9 hours * 21 days = 189 hours.

To find the hours of work per painter, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58.

Half of the 50 books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the train at each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it's $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 discount, so it costs $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

The area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, so the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the information given:

- Total pizzas: 4
- Slices per pizza: 8
- Becky ate 10 slices
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake

Since Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total:
Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person to find the total:
Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs:

1. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the visit costs $300/2 = $150.

2. The doctor charges $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. So, the parking costs $6 * 2 = $12.

3. The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers. Since we don't know the exact number of pills, we can't calculate the cost of the painkillers.

However, we can calculate the total cost of the visit without the painkillers: $150 (visit) + $12 (parking) = $162.

Since the question doesn't provide information about the number of painkillers, we can't determine the total cost of the visit. But if we assume the cost of the painkillers is negligible or not provided, the total cost of the visit would be $162.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both groups and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups: 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the promotion.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money each of them initially had. 

Let's denote Maggie's initial amount of money as M and Riza's initial amount of money as R. 

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left. This can be expressed as: 3/4 * M = 60. 

To find M, we multiply both sides by 4/3: M = 60 * 4/3 = 80.

Similarly, since Riza spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3 of her money left. This can be expressed as: 2/3 * R = 60.

To find R, we multiply both sides by 3/2: R = 60 * 3/2 = 90.

Now, we need to find out how much money they have left. Maggie has 3/4 * 80 = 60 dollars left, and Riza has 2/3 * 90 = 60 dollars left.

The total amount of money they have left is 60 + 60 = 120 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 315 by 7 to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day.

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas per day is 45, and the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75.

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. For the remaining 75 cents, we need 3 quarters (75/25 = 3).

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time it spends at the station is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the total time the second train spends at the station is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it spends 0 minutes at the station.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 40 minutes
- Waiting for the third train: 100 minutes
- Waiting for the fourth train: 120 minutes

Total waiting time = 10 + 40 + 100 + 120 = 270 minutes

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total required. 

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. 

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = Original price * 1.20
Selling price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Selling price = $3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we are looking for the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount percentage = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Discount percentage = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Discount percentage = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the friend actually paid more than the original price, not obtained a discount."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Now, we have 5 springs working at the same rate. So, the total rate of jellyfish creation is 5 jellyfish per second.

Next, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, we can multiply the rate of jellyfish creation (5 per second) by the number of seconds in 4 hours (3600 seconds) to find the total number of jellyfish created.

Total jellyfish created = 5 jellyfish/second * 3600 seconds = 18000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 18000"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into mathematical expressions. 

Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. We know that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's, so we can write the equation:

F = 2B + 15

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90, so we can substitute B = 90 into the equation:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score was 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and back, we need to add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home. 

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

Final answer: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of each banana is $0.80, so the total cost of buying bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost of buying bananas in bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. The sum of their shares should equal the total length of the fence, which is 100 feet.

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet.

To find the amount left over, we subtract the total amount of fence given to Sam and Harry from the total length of the fence: 100 - 20 - 80 = 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of $500): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which the farmer and the truck are removing the hay bales. The farmer is making 5 bales per hour, while the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. 

Since they are working together, their combined rate is 5 + 3 = 8 bales per hour. 

In a 6-hour day, they would remove 8 * 6 = 48 bales of hay.

Initially, we don't know the total number of bales in the field, but we can represent it as 'x'. After 6 hours, the number of bales left in the field would be x - 48.

However, we can't determine the exact number of bales left without knowing the initial number of bales. But we can express the number of bales left as x - 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per week, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes spent in class per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total minutes in a week is 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes.

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. This is the sum of the minutes spent in class and the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total minutes spent on learning per week is 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60. 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"To find the total area of the room, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the room is the sum of the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint to cover the entire room.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost to paint the room is 12 x $12 = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of shaken sodas and the number of shaken sodas remaining after Ellen's brother took one.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 2 shaken sodas left. Then, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda.

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left, and Ellen's friend can take it. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of remaining shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas remaining.

There is 1 shaken soda out of a total of 12 sodas (since Ellen's brother took 1 unshaken soda and 1 shaken soda, and Ellen took 1 unshaken soda initially). 

The probability is 1/12, which as a percentage is 8.33%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together to find the total distance between them.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

To find the total distance between the two trains, we add the distances traveled by each train: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to calculate the total number of days he is available to work. 

There are 31 days in March, and Billy takes 20% of the days off. 20% of 31 is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

So, Billy is available to work 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he is available to work: 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise, and she returned $15.00. So, the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. 

We can set up an equation to represent this: x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6*15 = 90.

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings and then determine how many years it will take her to save for her retirement.

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

To calculate how many years it will take her to save for her retirement, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings. Since she wants to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save: 20 years * $100,000 = $2,000,000.

Now, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings: $2,000,000 / $60,000 = 33.33 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement, but we need to consider the 20 years she plans to live on her savings. So, we subtract 20 years from the total number of years: 33.33 - 20 = 13.33 years.

Lauren needs to work for approximately 13.33 years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to first calculate the total number of days she has available for hiking.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, and June has 30 days, she has 30 days available for hiking.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in 30 days. She plans to hike 9,300 miles in total.

To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total number of miles by the number of days: 
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since she already plans to hike 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:
310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day.

So, Soledad must hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the light blinks per minute. 

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Divide 255 by 5 to get the number of blinks per minute: 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. 

Divide 459 by 51 to get the number of minutes: 459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To find the total number of male and female fish, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there were:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After Tate's purchase:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of female and male fish. 
- Female fish: 8
- Male fish: 6

The difference between the number of female and male fish is 8 - 6 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to add the time each person took:

4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles one way. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk. 

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since there are 5 workers in total, and 4 workers have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight. Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. The total weight of both dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris received 7 stickers from Luis and kept 9 stickers. This means Luis had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis used half of his stickers, so he had 2 times the number of stickers he gave to Kris. Since he gave 16 stickers to Kris, he must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth must have had 2 times the number of stickers Luis had. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags he can make.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Distance = Circumference / 2
Distance = 40,000 km / 2
Distance = 20,000 km

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 km at a rate of 400 km per day.

Days = Distance / Rate
Days = 20,000 km / 400 km/day
Days = 50 days

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
   So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   So, the speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago
x = 2x

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that x = 0, which is not possible. Let's rephrase the problem.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age now is 16, his age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14. We can write the equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago
14 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Since x represents Vince's age two years ago, Vince's current age is x + 2:
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to first find out how many boxes Nik will need. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box.

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16.

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds. Since the boxes also weigh 8 ounces each, we need to convert the weight of the boxes to pounds as well.

8 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 0.5 pounds per box

Now, we multiply the weight of each box by the number of boxes.

25 boxes * 0.5 pounds per box = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is 12.5 pounds. To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes.

12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes) = 25 pounds

2. He cuts the 64-foot logs into 4-foot logs. 
   64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

3. From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks. 
   16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

4. He sells each plank for $1.2. 
   80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the amount of money Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up an equation: 

Valerie's salary = 1/2 * brother's salary
5000 = 1/2 * brother's salary
Brother's salary = 5000 * 2
Brother's salary = 10000

Now, we know Valerie's salary and her brother's salary. We also know that their mother earns twice their combined salary. 

Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = 5000 + 10000 = 15000
Mother's salary = 2 * 15000
Mother's salary = 30000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together: 
Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, and she spends 40 minutes on the beach, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half of the time spent on the beach. 

Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we know that the total time spent on the sidewalk is 20 minutes and the total distance is 1 mile. We can find the rate of speed on the sidewalk by dividing the distance by the time.

Rate of speed on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 20 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can find the rate of speed on the beach by dividing the rate of speed on the sidewalk by 2.

Rate of speed on the beach = 0.05 miles per minute / 2 = 0.025 miles per minute

Now, we know the rate of speed on the beach and the time spent on the beach. We can find the time spent on the beach by dividing the distance by the rate of speed.

Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / 0.025 miles per minute = 80 minutes

Now, we know the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. We can find the total time by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

Total time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes = 100 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount. To do this, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week: 28 / 4 = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation. 

Initially, Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, and the water is now drinkable.

Since the water is now drinkable, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. Let's assume the unknown mug contains x ounces of water. 

The total amount of water Donny has now is 4 ounces (from the 33-degree mug) + 1 ounce (from the other mug) + x ounces (from the unknown mug) = 5 + x ounces.

The total temperature of the mixture is (4 * 33) + (1 * x) = 132 + x degrees.

Since the mixture is now drinkable, the temperature must be at least 40 degrees. So, we can set up the inequality:

132 + x ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives us:

x ≥ 8

Since x represents the amount of water in the unknown mug, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum value of x is 8 ounces.

Now, we need to find the temperature of the unknown mug. We know that the total amount of water in the unknown mug is 8 ounces. Since the temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, the temperature of the unknown mug must be:

(8 * 33) / 8 = 33 degrees

However, this would mean that the temperature of the unknown mug is the same as the 33-degree mug, which is not possible. Therefore, the temperature of the unknown mug must be higher than 33 degrees.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total amount of water in the unknown mug is 8 ounces. We also know that the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees. Since the temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, the temperature of the unknown mug must be higher than 33 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the unknown mug is y degrees. The total amount of water in the unknown mug is 8 ounces, and the total temperature of the mixture is (4 * 33) + (1 * y) + (8 * y) = 132 + 9y degrees.

Since the mixture is now drinkable, the temperature must be at least 40 degrees. So, we can set up the inequality:

132 + 9y ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives us:

9y ≥ -92

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

y ≥ -10.22

Since y represents the temperature of the unknown mug, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum value of y is 0 degrees.

132 + 9y ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives us:

9y ≥ -92

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

y ≥ -10.22

Since y represents the temperature of the unknown mug, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum value of y is 0 degrees, but this is not possible.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the total amount of water in the unknown mug is 8 ounces. We also know that the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees. Since the temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, the temperature of the unknown mug must be higher than 33 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the unknown mug is y degrees. The total amount of water in the unknown mug is 8 ounces, and the total temperature of the mixture is (4 * 33) + (1 * y) + (8 * y) = 132 + 9y degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of cows and chickens: 
Total animals = 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to get the total number of dozens of eggs.

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of red jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
= 2 * 17
= 34

Now, we know that the total number of jelly beans is 60, and we have already accounted for 17 green and 34 red jelly beans. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

Therefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the annual amount by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

Therefore, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x = 14x, where x is the multiplier for the ratio. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 14x = 84 and solve for x. 

14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus by multiplying the ratio 9x:
9x = 9 * 6
9x = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women:
54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, 34 women have remained on the bus.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total.

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold.

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. Since the revenue is $84, Adam loses $100 - $84 = $16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum time among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since 9 days is the maximum time, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs.

"To determine the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the total cost for one fish for the entire month would be:

31 days * $1/day = $31

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all of them for the entire month would be:

$31 * 3 = $93

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing 22 by 2.

Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally.

Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate it as follows:

Length of the second song = 5 minutes + (60% of 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people. 

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 energy units

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the energy demand as follows:

460 energy units / 20% = 460 / 0.2 = 2300 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of additional bottles needed as follows:

2300 bottles (required) - 4200 bottles (available) = -1900 bottles

However, since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the number of bottles needed. 

Let's recalculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the energy demand:

2300 people * 20% = 460 energy units
460 energy units / 20% = 460 / 0.2 = 2300 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of additional bottles needed as follows:

2300 bottles (required) - 4200 bottles (available) = -1900 bottles

However, we can also calculate the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to cover 100% of the energy demand:

2300 bottles (required) - 4200 bottles (available) = 1900 bottles

So, Hortex needs to produce 1900 more bottles to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, we know that 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, the number of babies wearing both purple and bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

We also know that all the blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 1/4 of the babies wearing blue, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows. This is the sum of the babies wearing both purple and bows, and the babies wearing blue: 2 + 2 = 4.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing both purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage chance is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

He then sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

Finally, he sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 (from the first two complexes) + 640 (from the last complex) = 1040 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation: 
4B + B + Y = 37
5B + Y = 37

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation, we get:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how much money Rissa was given initially. Since Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's denote the amount she gave to her sister as x. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 12 dollars.

Since Rissa gave her sister $3, Ronnie gave her sister $3 as well. 

Ronnie initially had $5, and she gave $3 to her sister. 

The amount left with Ronnie is 5 - 3 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since there are four colors in total, the amount of yellow paint will also be 'x'.

We also know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of paint used:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + 6 (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
Area of living room = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:
Total area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
= 960 + 1200 + 1000
= 3160 square feet

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

To find the total number of clouds counted across all five days, we need to add the number of clouds from each day:

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost per pod in the regular box. 

Cost per pod in the regular box = $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod.

Since the new box has 20% more pods, it has 100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Cost per pod in the new box = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

Now, we can find the number of cycles for $1 in the new box.

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, we add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk he used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45 (which is 45% expressed as a decimal). 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the remaining chalk after Monday. 

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, we need to divide 2.75 by 0.20 (which is 20% expressed as a decimal).

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. However, this is the number of days it will take for the chalk to be completely gone, not just less than 2 inches. 

The teacher will have 1 day left with more than 2 inches of chalk. 

So, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 14th day.

2 more than that is 15 + 2 = 17

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost of one book by dividing $500 by 100:

$500 ÷ 100 = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost of one book:

$27,000 ÷ $5 = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school:

5,400 ÷ 3 = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is: 1,800"

3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

6 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 14 pizzas

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, which is a total of 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles together: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we can divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say it takes x minutes for Jay to have 60 snowballs. The number of snowballs Jay builds in x minutes is (1/3)x, and the number of snowballs that melt in x minutes is (2/15)x.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x - (2/15)x = 60

To solve for x, we can first find a common denominator, which is 15. Multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get:

5x - 2x = 900

Combine like terms:

3x = 900

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 300

So, it will take Jay 300 minutes, or 5 hours, to have 60 snowballs.

300"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 years old now, and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can write the equation: 
2x = 28

To find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since Digimon was released 20 years ago, we need to subtract 20 from Jim's age at the time of release to find his current age:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all three: 
Doxa (1) + her sister (2) + her brother (3) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

So, in total, they ate 6 slices of the apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Since the haircut costs $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. So, her total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus = $270 + $40 = $310

The final answer is: $310"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to multiply the frequency of each task by its respective payment and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is $600, and the total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800. 

The total cost of everything John buys is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total number of White Oak trees 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, we can calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 90 = 120.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of fish with red stripes = Total number of fish / 3
= 66 / 3
= 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are:

Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Next, we are told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We can calculate this as follows:

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
= (5/11) * 44
= 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with both red and blue stripes. Since we already know that 22 fish have red stripes, and 20 fish have blue stripes, we can simply add these two numbers together:

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the question asks for the height from the second floor's floor, not the height of the roof above the ground. 

So, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house and then subtract the height of the first floor to get the height of the roof above the second floor. 

The height of the roof above the ground is 420 - 240 = 180 inches. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the height of the roof above the ground. 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 - 180 = 0 inches.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share would be 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

"To find the total amount of exercise the dogs need per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average miles walked per dog. 

There are 4 dogs, and the average is 3 miles per dog. 
4 dogs * 3 miles = 12 miles

Now, let's subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs: 
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles

To find the miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total required miles:
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much John borrowed from the loan. Since the loan is 40% of the house's value, we calculate 40% of $250,000.

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

2. Next, we need to find out how much John used to pay off his debts. Since he used 60% of the loan, we calculate 60% of $100,000.

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

3. To find out how much money John had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine first. Since it's 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3.

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we add the amount of the first medicine to the amount of the second medicine to get the total amount in one dose.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 1/8 * 120 = 15
John's class capacity = 15 * 2 = 30
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of his school = 30 * 2 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 (Ali's school) + 60 (John's school) = 180.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in those months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we add the interest to the total amount he pays in the first 11 months: $275 + $6 = $281.

The remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is the total amount owed minus the amount paid in the first 11 months: $300 - $281 = $19.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $19 in the twelfth month.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 children * 5 changes per child = 10 diaper changes.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the total diaper changes. Half of 10 is 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height: 
6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the total volume by 0.8 to get the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
540 cubic inches / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans:
675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between Tim's guess and the true number, we subtract the true number from the estimated number:
202.5 - 900 = -697.5.

The final answer is: -698"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station, making the total number of people 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled. Since there were 90 people on the bus, doubling that number gives 90 * 2 = 180. This means the bus is now full.

To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to subtract the current number of people from the bus's capacity. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. Therefore, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of Pauline's visits before and after the price increase.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After 5 years, the cost increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5.

Since Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 8 years, the total number of visits is 3 * 8 = 24.

The total cost of her visits before the price increase is 2 * 24 = $48.

The total cost of her visits after the price increase is 5 * 24 = $120.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is the sum of the two costs: $48 + $120 = $168.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time it will take for all groups to try the escape room. Each group uses their full 45 minutes, so:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must be equal to 40. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how much ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of ground beef needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the pounds of ground beef by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount for getting both services, we calculate the discount as follows: 
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's add the cost of nail art for each finger. There are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), and the cost of nail art per nail is $3.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's represent the original amount as 'x'. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, we can substitute 'x' with 20:

20 - Pomelos given away = 20/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can simplify the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 5

Now, we can solve for 'Pomelos given away':

Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Now, we subtract the apples he ate from the total number of apples:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, we need to find out how many apples Walter gave to his sister. Since he gave 25% of the remaining apples, we can calculate it as follows:

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

Now, we subtract the apples he gave to his sister from the remaining apples:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, we can calculate the total hours traveled as follows:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes used by the mother to the total used by Madeline and her brother. 

So, the initial number of grapes is 84 + 48 = 132 grapes.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as x. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold x/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold x - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the total number of books can be represented as:

x + (x/2) + (x - 5) = 110

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x - 10 = 220

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 220

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 230

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 46

Now that we know the number of books the bottom shelf can hold, we can find the number of books the middle and top shelves can hold:

Middle shelf: x/2 = 46/2 = 23
Top shelf: x - 5 = 46 - 5 = 41

Since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, we need 2 middle shelves to hold 20 books. We have 90 books left (110 - 20 = 90). We can fit 9 books on the top shelf (41 < 90), so we need 1 more middle shelf to hold the remaining 90 - 9 = 81 books.

In total, we need 2 middle shelves and 1 top shelf, and 1 bottom shelf. Therefore, Elly needs 4 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Now, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

70% of 110 questions = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

Since she already got 60% of the first test correct, we can calculate the number of questions she got right on the first test:

60% of 70 questions = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

77 - 42 = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, as a bead is not a marble.

So, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one customer. So, to find out how many calls he needs to make to get 15 customers, we can divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

15 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 15 * 25 = 375 calls

However, we also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars, we can divide 15 by 1/2 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers).

15 cars / 1/2 car per 2 customers = 15 * 2 = 30 customers

Now, we have two different numbers of calls needed to get 15 customers. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 375 and 30. 

The LCM of 375 and 30 is 750.

Therefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, so the total number of flashlights is 4 * 2 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16. The total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles together. The total number of flashlights is 8, and the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

So, Brianna's family is using 8 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of helmets and then the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

Number of footballs = Number of helmets * 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we can calculate the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of helmets, robots, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of helmets + Number of robots + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 20 + 10 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day at work, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls for the 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5.

24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and then subtract the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for the remaining plants. Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have been accounted for. So, the remaining number of plants is 20 - 12 = 8.

Since the remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we multiply 8 by 0.25: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water needed: 2 cups (for the 4 plants) + 8 cups (for the 8 plants) + 2 cups (for the remaining 8 plants) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time = Distance / Speed

For the land part: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For the water part: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Since these two parts are happening simultaneously, we need to find the total time by adding the time it takes for both parts. However, since they are happening at the same time, we can simply add the time it takes for the land part and the time it takes for the water part.

Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 * 2 = $40.

The cost of the four additional phones is $40 * 4 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since he speaks 375 words per minute, we can calculate the time it takes him to speak 10 pages.

Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Time = Total words / Speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people is twice the number on the second day, so it's 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (4 days). To find the total number of people for these 4 days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, we add up the total number of people Conor saw each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped so far is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   Since the initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 80 + 240 = 320.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   Since the rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 320 + 120 = 440.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   Since 120 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels. 
   The total number of kernels popped is 440 + 30 = 470.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim plans to make. He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and an extra gallon that is twice as tart. 

Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as the other 3 gallons. So, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 4 gallons (3 regular) + 2 gallons (extra) = 6 gallons.

Since 1 gallon requires 6 lemons, 6 gallons will require 6 x 6 = 36 lemons.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, there must be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32. We have 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, so the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
= 32 - (4 + 8)
= 32 - 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled and then determine the direction he is from his house.

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours and then turned around and traveled east for 8 hours, we can calculate the total distance he traveled as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
For the westward journey: Distance = 18mph x 5 hours = 90 miles
For the eastward journey: Distance = 18mph x 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can calculate the net distance he is from his house as follows:

Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

We also know that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. We know that Dallas dropped 4 marbles and ended up with 21. So, we can calculate the initial number of marbles Dallas had by adding the dropped marbles to the final amount:

Initial marbles = Final marbles + Dropped marbles
Initial marbles = 21 + 4
Initial marbles = 25

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given away is equal to the initial number of marbles Dallas had. We know that Mazie had 52 marbles initially. So, we can set up an equation:

Initial marbles = Total marbles given away
25 = Total marbles given away

Since the total marbles given away is the sum of the marbles given to Dallas and Darla, we can set up another equation:

Initial marbles = Marbles given to Dallas + Marbles given to Darla
25 = 21 (Dallas' marbles) + Marbles given to Darla

Now, we can solve for the marbles given to Darla:

Marbles given to Darla = Initial marbles - Marbles given to Dallas
Marbles given to Darla = 25 - 21
Marbles given to Darla = 4

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to first determine the age of the older brother. 

Since one brother is 12 years old, and he is half the age of the older brother, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, we know the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years old
- 3 sisters: 16 years old each

The total age of the siblings is: 
12 + 24 + (16 * 3) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 (since there are 28 days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The total area of the quilt is 101 square feet.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find out how many pens Sarah has, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 

First, calculate the original price of 2 T-shirts: 2 * $8 = $16
Then, apply the 50% discount: $16 * 0.5 = $8
So, Jake pays $8 for 2 T-shirts.

For the shoes, Jake buys a pair with a 40% discount. The original price of the shoes is $40.

First, calculate the discount amount: $40 * 0.4 = $16
Then, subtract the discount from the original price: $40 - $16 = $24
So, Jake pays $24 for the shoes.

Now, add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together: $8 + $24 = $32

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $32.

"To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18 dollars

He spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so the total amount spent on ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5 dollars

Now, subtract the amount spent on ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13 dollars

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, divide the remaining amount by the cost of a ticket:

"To determine the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of making one jar of the mixture. 

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12.
The cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12.
The cost of 2 pounds of honey is 2 * $10 = $20.
The total cost of making one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, we can calculate the profit per jar by subtracting the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

1. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

2. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)

3. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

4. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog during Nate's vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog creates 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. We can divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the question is asking for the total number of eggs in both baskets, not the number of eggs in each individual basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can assume that the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we simply add the number of eggs in each basket: 10 (from the first basket) + 20 (from the second basket) = 30.

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can calculate the time she took to run 4 miles as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can calculate the distance he ran as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16
Distance = 16x

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance she ran would be 2 * 16x = 32x.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is half of the distance Aaron ran. So, we can set up the equation:

32x / 2 = 4
32x = 8
x = 8 / 32
x = 1/4

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can calculate Vanessa's time:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/4)
Time = 8 * 4
Time = 32

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price.

20% of $400 = 0.2 * 400 = $80

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Cost of labor = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

We can simplify the first equation by subtracting b from both sides: c = 20 - b.

Now, we can substitute c in the second equation: 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get: 40 - 2b + 4b = 70.

Combine like terms: 2b = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b into the equation c = 20 - b: c = 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.
