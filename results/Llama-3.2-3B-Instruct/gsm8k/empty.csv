"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

James runs 180 meters per week."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total feed so far: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we can multiply the total feed by the number of chickens to find the total daily feed needed.

Total daily feed: 40 cups * 20 chickens = 800 cups

Since Wendi has already given the chickens 40 cups of feed, we subtract this from the total daily feed to find the amount needed for the final meal.

Final meal feed: 800 cups - 40 cups = 760 cups

The final answer is: 760"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. This takes 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download takes 20 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes (first download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 80 minutes (second download) = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

3. He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is now 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost of $90.

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
2. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold 1/2 of the remaining vacuum cleaners after selling at the green house and red house.
3. Let's assume she sold x vacuum cleaners at the green house and 2 at the red house. Then, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x + 2.
4. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house is 5 + (x + 2) = y.
5. Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house is twice the number she sold at the orange house. So, y = 2 * (number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house).
6. Since she sold half of what was left after selling at the green and red house, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is half of y, which is y/2.
7. Now we can set up the equation: y = 2 * (y/2) + 2 + x
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: y = y + 2 + x
9. Subtracting y from both sides, we get: 0 = 2 + x
10. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: -2 = x
11. Since x is the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house, we can now find the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with: y = 5 + (x + 2) = 5 + (-2 + 2) = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they travel the same distance on the first day, each train covers 80 miles westward.

On the second day, they cover 150 miles northward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered on both days to find the total distance covered by each train.

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply 21 eggs per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain the desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - (4 + 2)
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the orange drink is 10 liters, and we spilled 1 liter, so the remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

Now, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 9 liters. 
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 9 = 18 liters.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the answer, we need to first find Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25.

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth (23) from his current age (25).

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
- The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to subtract the start time from the end time. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's rephrase the question: Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means the second stop is 15 miles from the end of the trip, not from the first stop.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 15 miles

Now, we add the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop:
40 + 15 = 55 miles

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Final answer: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games and had $5 left, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know he had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we are asked how many Lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his Lego sets, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

"To find the distance Polly could stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks * Cost per pound
Total cost = 1 pound * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $10.00

Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, and he used 1 pound of beeswax, he made 10 candles. 
Total cost = 10 candles * $1.00 per candle (since he already accounted for the cost of the wick in the initial cost of the pound of wax)
Total cost = $10.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

80 + 220 = 300

However, she had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since she initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243.

The final answer is: 243"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to first find the number of blue ties and the cost of a red tie.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties is:
200 / 40 = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
5 x 2 = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of a red tie is:
40 + (40 x 0.5) = 60

The total amount spent on red ties is:
10 x 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is:
200 + 600 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is:
15 * 8 = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
3/4 * 120 = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
120 - 90 = 30 units

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:
7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. 
To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

Adding the individual raspberries: 120 + 67 = 187

There are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

Janet paid $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years separately.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500. 

So, her annual pension for the remaining 10 years will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500

The final answer is: $52,500."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, she paid:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is:
140 * 0.1 = $14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
840 + 756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

We can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon: 
100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles ÷ 3 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
100 * 3 = 4x
300 = 4x
x = 300 / 4
x = 75

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent each day and then multiply it by 4 weeks.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and Cecilia will feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 910 / 110 = 8.27 (round up to 9 bags, since you can't buy a fraction of a bag).

"To find the number of games won, we need to first find the number of games lost. 

Let's say the number of games lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Total amount of potato salad needed: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the age differences between the children.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

So, Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept.

2/3 of 9 hours = (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours

Since Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, we can find the difference by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

16 / 3 = 5.33 (round down to 5 since we can't use a fraction of a tomato)

So, Freda used 5 cans of tomatoes.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is:
2 * 40 = 80

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is:
80 + 18 = 98

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. So, the number of potted plants she will have left is:
98 - 40 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). So, he drinks 5 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 1 glass of water on Sunday, but he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water on Sunday. So, he drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 0 glasses of water on Sunday.

Total glasses of water John drinks in a week = 5 (weekdays) + 1 (Saturday) = 6 glasses.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which it covers the distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

So, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. 

14 sets of 10 minutes is 140 minutes.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year.

This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet to reach the shore.

Since the shore was 64 seconds away and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can divide 64 by 16 to find the total number of 20-foot intervals: 
64 / 16 = 4

Since she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, she rowed 4 x 20 feet in 4 x 16 seconds = 64 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took on for each 20-foot interval. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Since 20 feet is 2 x 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 20 feet.

Since Julia rowed 64 feet, the boat took on 64 / 20 = 3.2 times 2 liters of water.

3.2 x 2 = 6.4 liters

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to divide the total number of photographs on Jamal's phone by 6, since his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

First, we need to find the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we divide 1800 by 6 to get the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we divide the number of photographs on Brittany's phone by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 
$270 - $180 = $90

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as:

60 (letters needing stamps) / 3 = 20 letters

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the current total:

   Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

2. Now, find the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.
   Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

To find out the total number of questions Mark completed, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 + 30 = 70 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, we subtract to find the number of questions left incomplete: 
75 - 70 = 5 questions

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22

= 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Let's assume the number of queens is Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, and the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees. So, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Since the total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens, we can write the equation:

700 = 4Q + 2Q + Q

Combine like terms:
700 = 7Q

Divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
Baby bees = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:
Worker bees = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his weekly earnings would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To find the total cost, first, we need to calculate the total cost of the food items (milk and eggs) and the non-food items (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps).

The total cost of the food items is: 
2 (milk) + 3 (eggs) = 5 dollars

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
3 (light bulbs) + 3 (cups) + 4 (roach traps) = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on the non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
10 (non-food items) * 0.10 (10% tax) = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items:
10 (non-food items) + 1 (tax) = 11 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items (including tax):
5 (food items) + 11 (non-food items) = 16 dollars

The total cost of everything is 16 dollars.

"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients. 

8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = 16 bottles of bleach
16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle = $32
8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = 8 packs of cloths
8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack = $40

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Total income = $92
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. So, the total number of bees that left in the first 3 periods is 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees.
5. Since 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that left in the first 3 periods and hadn't returned yet is 105 - 15 = 90 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left in the first 3 periods return, which is 90 bees.

Therefore, Debra saw 90 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Final answer: 90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of friends James has, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then add them together.

For bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * 25 cents = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50
For tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * 25 cents = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25
For the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * 25 cents = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25

Now, let's add the amounts together: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: 
$10 - $6 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

1. Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind.
2. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'x'. Then, 1/3 of 'x' is 5. So, x = 5 * 3 = 15.
3. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries, so the remaining fries before the raccoon ate 15 - 2/3 * 15 = 15 - 10 = 5.
4. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries before the pigeons ate 5 + 9 = 14.
5. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7. Dave ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries.
6. Dave initially ate 14 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, Kimo spends 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches.

Now, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length by 12.

Total length in feet = (1200 + 720 + 2880) / 12
Total length in feet = 4800 / 12
Total length in feet = 400 feet

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. The tank had 17 feet of water on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we need to calculate two thirds of 24 feet.
   Two thirds of 24 feet is (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each type of toy.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

We are also given that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:

This is the amount Jessica pays per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.5833 minutes

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

Converting the total time to seconds for easier understanding:
94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 5699.94"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 / 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Since they made 1 gallon, they spent $35 on lemons.

"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

Total number of Asians = 240
Number of Japanese = 80
Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all his expenses and donations."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got as follows:

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:

Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. 
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner on the less well-rounded team.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in total time between the two teams is:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = (0.5 - 0.1111) * 100% ≈ 58.89%

So, Jerry is approximately 58.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 58.89%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom.

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.
Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Total apples picked = 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first find the total number of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits.

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw used is 160, the number of straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for rats is 3 x 6 = 18.

Since 90 pieces of straw are used for rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces, the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first calculate the interest for 1 month, then multiply it by 3.

Interest for 1 month = Principal * Rate
Interest for 1 month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for 1 month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the number of bags sold, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's assume the trader bought x bags of wheat.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 
Total Revenue = 30x

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation:
Total Cost = 20x + 2x
Total Cost = 22x

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
400 = 30x - 22x
400 = 8x

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

50"
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Total amount of insects per week = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years:

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees a year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:

100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is: 56"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are now 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24."

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them up.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find out how much Mark makes from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark makes from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amount he makes from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award:
He makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:
$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the award amount:
$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

However, since the award is a one-time monetary reward, it's not a raise in salary. It's a lump sum payment. So, his salary remains the same, and the award is just an additional amount he received.

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $109,000.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. 
She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she has 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.
She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she has 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens together:
22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the average of the six tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by 6. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
To do this, we multiply the desired average by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is:
$30 + $20 x 2 = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn:
$70 - $10 = $60

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we can divide $60 by $5:
$60 / $5 = 12

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60. To do this, we can divide $60 by $4:
$60 / $4 = 15

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to find the perimeter of the park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

2. Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

4. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons of water, it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

5. We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

6. We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

7. Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 8 - 16 = y, so y = -8. However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be negative. We made a mistake in our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate our steps. We made a mistake in step 4. We should have set up the equation 2x - 16 = 4y and 2x - 32 = 4y. 

2x - 16 = 4y
2x - 32 = 4y

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get -16 = 0, which is not true. This means our initial assumption that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago was incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy from her hourly wage.

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

Final answer: 44"
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of the initial amount.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay:

$165 x 12 = $1980

Since the total amount she needs to pay is $2200 and she will pay $1980, the remaining balance will be:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to find their current ages and add them up, then divide by 3.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34.
Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is 54."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%."

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to first find out how many penguins went in each direction.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to John's candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first find the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes. 

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students.

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

Since the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.
2. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.
3. Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.
4. Now, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed: 
   - Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
   - Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
5. Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to first find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of cows in each stall becomes:
20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) / 20 stalls = 6 cows per stall.

Now, we need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. 
Number of cows in 8 stalls = 6 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 48 cows.

The final answer is 48."

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to 44:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.

"Let's break down the problem:

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches, so the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents.

To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 
40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of 80 flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

The customer will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. The total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's call this number 'x'. So, we can set up the equation: 10x = 39.
5. To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 / 10 = 3.9.

Since the number of medals given out must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question does not specify that the number of medals given out must be a whole number, so we can provide the exact answer.

The final answer is: 3.9"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. 

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works and then multiply it by her earnings per minute.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

In the fourth round, all players get an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since all players have more than 20 points, they will get an extra point each.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old, and he washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity on both days and add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there were 3 other people who bid once. So, the bids were $200, $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids were $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350, so we need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid. 

$350 (final bid) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) = $650

However, we also need to add the cost of the bids made by the other 3 people. 

$50 (first bid) + $50 (second bid) + $50 (third bid) = $150

Now, we add the cost of the desk to the bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen's last bid. 

$650 + $150 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. 

Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the cost of driving plus the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the tabloid.

Since the tabloid is folded in half, we have two sides: left and right. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper.

However, we also need to consider the front and back of each side. 

- The left side has 8 pages (pages 1-8) on the front and 8 pages (pages 9-16) on the back.
- The right side has 8 pages (pages 17-24) on the front and 8 pages (pages 25-32) on the back.

So, we need 8 + 8 = 16 pieces of paper for the front and 8 + 8 = 16 pieces of paper for the back.

In total, we need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she brought.

Annika brought $50.
She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total money spent = $25 + $10 = $35

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month. 

Since Watson works 5 days a week and there are 4 weeks in April, he works a total of 5 * 4 = 20 days in April.

He earns $10 per hour and works for 10 hours each day, so his daily earnings are 10 * 10 = $100.

His total earnings for the month are 20 * $100 = $2000.

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the month since the company performed well. So, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300."

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses per week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks by the weight lost per week to find the total weight lost.

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

Cost of 6 business suits: 6 * $100 = $600
Cost of 3 suitcases: 3 * $50 = $150
Cost of flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200
Total cost of items purchased: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total cost of items purchased from his total budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we need to subtract that from the remaining amount: $4050 - $2000 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs consumed per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old six years ago.
   Noah's age six years ago = 40

2. Now, we can calculate Noah's current age:
   Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
   Noah's current age = 40 + 6
   Noah's current age = 46

3. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
   Population of Chile six years ago = 120000

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can calculate the current population of Chile:
   Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
   Population of Chile now = 2 * 120000
   Population of Chile now = 240000

The final answer is: 240000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people who had previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is required. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of sets of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3.

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since each set of 3 electric wires requires 1 electric pole, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women.

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 3 men left, and 10 people in total left. Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book.
2. The book costs $4.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine.

Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

So, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got and then work backwards to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can divide the total number of new records by 5 to find out how many new records each person got:

7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll assume that each person got 1 new record (as you can't trade a fraction of a record).

Now, we know that each person got 1 new record, and they traded 2 old records for each new record. So, for each person, the number of old records traded is equal to the number of new records they got.

Since each person got 1 new record, they must have traded 1 old record.

Now, we multiply the number of old records each person traded by the number of people:

1 old record per person * 5 people = 5 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 5 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 of 100 = (2/5) * 100 = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Salary of junior programmers = $2000 per month
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Total salary of junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month
Total salary of senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to add the number of people who got on at the first stop to the number of people who got on at the second stop, and then subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop.

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 - 7 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break down the events:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000. 

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that number by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

There are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we know that John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. 

Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students. 

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, we can set up the equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

So, the smallest group has 105 students.

105"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows.

Let's say the number of cows is x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and add them together:

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

He started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. 

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

So, at the end of the fourth week, Josh had 6 balls. 

However, he dropped 3 balls, and 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 

6 - 1 = 5 balls.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the weight of the blue beetle, we know that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird)
Total weight = 200 pounds.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, calculate the discount on one shirt:

Discount on one shirt = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:

Price of one shirt after discount = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:

Total cost of 2 shirts = $18 * 2 = $36

"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the number of pots she needs from the total she had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since she saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $0"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

2. Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

3. Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have had $8 initially. Since he spent $1.5 on candy, he must have had $8 - $1.5 = $6.5 left.

4. Since Billy had $6.5 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide $6.5 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. $6.5 / $1.5 = 4.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: 
C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:
45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S
S = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The final answer is 0.0375."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.

So, a bed for a collie takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   This means 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   This means 3 * 7 = 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50.

Now, let's find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:
50 (total) - 3 (refusing to wear masks) - 7 (shoplifting) - 21 (physical violence) = 19

So, 19 customers were kicked out for other reasons.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4.67
Erin's points before = 14

However, this doesn't make sense, as Erin scored 14 points after scoring 14 points. This means Erin must have had 0 points before scoring 14 points.

The correct answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs:

   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000 and 160,000 are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is:
400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 240,000

Final answer: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
Total amount = $3,650 + (10% of $3,650)
Total amount = $3,650 + $365
Total amount = $4,015

Since Karan has to pay for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment = Total amount / 5
Monthly payment = $4,015 / 5
Monthly payment = $802

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $802."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also need to multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

Final answer: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Since she spends $18 on supplies, her total cost is $18.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14 people who can't make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."

"To find out how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Dasha saves $30 - $18 = $12.

So, David saves $12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

Total number of gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Total amount of ribbon = 144 inches

Now, divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 1.5 hours
- Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total capacity is 6 x 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we need to find double the capacity first. 

Double the capacity is 2 x 36 = 72 books.

Then, we add 20 more books to that, so 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she received 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

"To find the energy saved, we need to first find the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate.

Original energy usage per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)
Total energy usage in 30 days = 7200 Wh * 30 = 216,000 Wh

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours:
New energy usage per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate = 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh

Energy saved per day = Original energy usage - New energy usage
= 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh
= 135,000 Wh

To convert Wh to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:
Energy saved per day = 135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh

Energy saved in 30 days = 135 kWh * 30 = 4050 kWh

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400.
The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800.
The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240.
The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. 

However, we can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, since the problem doesn't provide any other information. 

So, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as 5% of 50,000:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

So, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 380"
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the number of heads and bumps.

Let's assume the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'.

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of bumps is 2c + d.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

c + d = 180

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304, so we can write another equation:

2c + d = 304

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' and 'd' by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size.

Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the elevation of Stanley and the distance the comb fell. 

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Elevation of Stanley + Distance the comb fell
= 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet
= 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Difference in elevation = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Elevation of Oliver
= 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet
= 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total capital = Initial capital + Amount received from the first bank + Amount received from the second bank
Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000
Total capital = $14000

The final answer is: $14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: 30 * 3/5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: $8/month * 6 months = $48
2. The next 8 months: $12/month * 8 months = $96
3. The last 8 months: $14/month * 8 months = $112

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total amount Cole saved. Since he saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. 

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). 

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4.
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.
The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first find out how much money he made from selling the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he must have made $50 from selling the cards. 

Let's say he started with x cards. He sells x - 1/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5(x - 1/3).

We know that the amount of money he made from selling the cards is $50. So we can set up the equation:

1.5(x - 1/3) = 50

To solve for x, we need to first simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.5 = 50

Now, add 0.5 to both sides:

1.5x = 50.5

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 50.5 / 1.5
x = 33.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 33

So, Kenny started with 33 cards."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. 

Since 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, the remaining guests who only had one hotdog are:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of 6 is 3. 
Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons = 15 * 1/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

So, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first calculate how much money he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends to find out how many each friend received.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 4 = 16 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 16 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, divide the total oranges by the total number of people:
56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it takes Bernadette 4 x 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Jon's bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
James' bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Jon's run time: 50 minutes
James' run time: We don't know this yet, but we can call it x.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = x

So, James' run time is 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards
Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards

Total cards: 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student got 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30 students.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9.
She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount.
Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8, so Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $1 more.

The final answer is: $1"

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total number of minutes (240) by the number of days he can walk (7 days in a week, but he can only walk 4 days a week).

First, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total. Since he wants to break in the shoes in 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 3 weeks by 7 days per week.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21).

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 11.43 minutes per day for 4 days a week to break in his new shoes in 3 weeks.

11.43"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books she bought.

$300 / $15 = 20 books

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books / 4 kids = 5 books per kid

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both, as they were counted twice: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by 5 (the number of days).

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds his horses twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by 50 to find out how many bags: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest).
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3x + x = 120,000
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

So, the house cost $30,000."

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the amount of money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48. 
The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first find the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the triplets and multiply the number of skeins required for each item.

For a hat: 3 grandchildren * 1 hat = 3 hats
For a scarf: 3 grandchildren * 1 scarf = 3 scarves
For a sweater: 3 grandchildren * 1 sweater = 3 sweaters
For a pair of mittens: 3 grandchildren * 1 pair = 3 pairs
For a pair of socks: 3 grandchildren * 1 pair = 3 pairs

Now, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed:
- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs * 1 skein = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs * 2 skeins = 6 skeins

Total number of skeins needed: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

Total loaves baked = 200
Loaves sold in the morning = 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132
Loaves returned = 6
Loaves left = 200 - 132 + 6 = 74

The bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the smallest number of rows, which is 3 rows.

The final answer is: 3"

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Original daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since half a house takes 5 days).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10/5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, we can set up the equation:

20 = x - 2

Solving for x, we get:
x = 20 + 2
x = 22

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: 108"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, let's divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought:
$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours, the weeks he worked 5 hours, and the week he worked 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked 4 hours: 4 hours/week * 5 weeks = 20 hours
For the week he worked 5 hours: 5 hours
For the week he worked 6 hours: 6 hours

Now, we add up the hours: 20 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 31 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers now is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 years old, which is x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400. We know the cost of the computer and the printer, so we can subtract these from the total to find the cost of the monitors.

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 / 2 = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

3. The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

5. He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the target for the second half of the month: 
$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half of the month. 

We know that the total amount saved in the first half of the month is equal to the total amount saved in the second half of the month, so we can set up the equation:
x * 15 = 2x * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = $562.50

Since Elvis saves $562.50 per day in the first half of the month, he will save 2x = $1125 per day in the second half of the month.

$1125 / 15 = $75

The final answer is: $75"

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance from his home to work. 

Distance from home to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since James has two sons, he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles needed by 5.

2 (candles for the 12-year-old) + 2 (candles for the 8-year-old) = 4 candles

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by dividing the total minutes by 1.5 and multiplying by 2. 

105 minutes / 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let Shiloh's current age be S and his nephew's current age be N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to follow the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

From the first statement, we can write an equation: 
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = M + 20

From the second statement, we can write another equation:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for Mark's goals:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now, we can solve for Anna's goals:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $55 left, so he can buy:
$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have:
- 3 wooden action figures
- 27 plastic action figures

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4:

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied in a month: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses supplied to the shops:

260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days and then divide by 7.

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5: (20 + (20/2)) / 5
   First, calculate half of 20: 20/2 = 10
   Then, add 10 to 20: 20 + 10 = 30
   Finally, divide 30 by 5: 30 / 5 = 6
3. The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12)
   First, subtract 12 from 20: 20 - 12 = 8
   Then, multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie to minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is $10.00. So, the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

First, we need to find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words from 52 WPM, so the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' spouses, and the number of people she directly invited.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited brought 2 friends, so the total number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, so the total number of additional people invited is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. The total number of people attending the event is 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it is taller than Mark's window.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window.
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it is now 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can divide 200 grams by 100 grams to find out how many cups he eats per day: 
200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day

Since each cup has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup: 
2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 
6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight he initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Total games after 3 years: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

"To find the total cost of the outfit, first, calculate the discount on the shirt: 
$25 * 0.3 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, the total cost will be the total cost of the outfit plus the sales tax. However, the problem does not specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), the sales tax is:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe started with $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase."
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

4 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."

"To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of seats occupied by administrators is:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents is:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students is:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is:
24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed = 20 kb per second
To convert to Mb per second, divide by 1000:
20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we need to multiply her speed by 60 to get the speed in Mb per hour:
0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/hour

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and James sold 10 cars. So the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is the total cost minus the amount paid by the company, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, the price of a silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel.

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
3. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
4. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 off = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.
The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'.

From the second equation, we can express 'g' in terms of 's': g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, the cost of the apple pie is:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
= 32 recipes

The final answer is 32."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of history teachers = 60% of 150
= 0.6 * 150
= 90

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars.

Final answer: 120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the month is:
12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

Final answer: 15"
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog needs 1 toy. This means he has 4 toys.

2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs.

3. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys in total.

4. When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

5. However, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

6. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:
   1200 * 2/5 = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
   1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3:
   720 * 2/3 = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:
   720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 x 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 x 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

Number of potatoes = 96
Number of hash browns = 36

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to find out how many cookies each person has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies:
Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies of all three:
Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to first find the length before the 50% extension. 

Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

The final answer is: 14."

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in a year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in a year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is the cost of the heartworm check. We can write this as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He spent $100 on the vet visit, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6

"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free"", Erin can actually get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

Cost of picking blueberries: $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store: $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 x $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 x 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to follow the given percentages step by step.

1. 100 people apply, and 30% receive interviews. 
   30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

2. Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer.
   20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

3. Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position.
   A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

Last week: 4 boxes

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4

Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply by the number of minutes.

When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are up, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Since she dances for 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes, we can calculate the total number of taps as follows:

- When her arms are down: 550 taps per minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
- When her arms are up: 400 taps per minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 = -20. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this means that the friends ate more slices than the total number of slices available. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 
The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, so the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
The average time is (9 * 30 + 9 * 20) / (2 * 9) = (270 + 180) / 18 = 450 / 18 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find the total number of smores needed, we need to calculate the number of smores for kids and adults separately.

For kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34

"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and then add them up.

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 = 0.05 x $140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

Final answer: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists: 20
Number of songs in each playlist: 300
Length of each song: 10 hours

Total number of songs: 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours: 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that 1/3 of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Let's set up an equation: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first find out how many cases the first house needs.

The first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, which is 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases.

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2 * 125 = 250 cases.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

The total amount spent is $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to 200.

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to first find out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs for 4 liters of juice. 

Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice, for 4 liters, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * 3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also add the number of books Ahmed read (150).

300 + 150 + 150 = 600

The total number of books read is 600.

Final answer: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Since Tanya earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns this bonus on both Monday and Wednesday. So, we add $5 * 2 = $10 to her total earnings for both days.

Total earnings for Monday and Wednesday = $300 + $60 + $10 = $370

The final answer is: $370"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made:
20 * 3 = $60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling eggplants, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount he wants to make:
$135 - $60 = $75

This means he needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):
$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time taken to drive back home
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
   1/3 * 600 = 200 movies

2. Since Mike can get these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find out how much the series would cost if they were bought individually. Since a normal movie costs $10, the series would cost:
   200 * $10 = $2000

   But Mike can get them for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, so we need to divide the cost by 6:
   $2000 / 6 = $333.33

3. Now, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total number of movies:
   600 - 200 = 400 movies

4. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate this as:
   0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

5. Since these older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies:
   160 * $5 = $800

6. Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies that are not in series or older movies. Since there are 400 movies left, and 160 are older movies, we subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:
   400 - 160 = 240 movies

7. Since these movies are not in series or older movies, they cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. So, we can calculate the cost of these movies:
   240 * $10 = $2400

8. Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:
   $333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 mph
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we can multiply the hiking speed by the time:
Distance = Hiking speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

First, subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so the total number of times is:
3 * 5 = 15

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. 
So, the total number of times for these 2 days is:
6 * 2 = 12

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 17 = -14 (this is not possible, so we will assume the assistant took out 3 orange fish and 14 white fish, or 14 orange fish and 3 white fish, but we will use the first scenario for our calculation).

Let's use the first scenario: 3 orange fish were taken out, and 14 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish (this is not possible, so we will use the second scenario for our calculation).

Let's use the second scenario: 14 orange fish were taken out, and 3 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 + 14 = 17 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

After adding the new fish to the pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(1)

Since this equation is not true, we will re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x.

The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the problem states that Bob bought some fish. So, we will round up to the nearest whole number.

Rounding up 4.5 to the nearest whole number is not possible in this case, so we will use 4.5 as the answer.

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we will re-evaluate the problem again.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we will re-evaluate the problem again.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

Final answer: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150.

Final answer: $150"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4.

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour
For 3 hours, she earns:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and then multiply it by the salary per employee.

- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

Total number of employees after 3 months: 260

Salary per employee: $4000
Total salary paid per month: 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

Total salary paid after 3 months: $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after each raise.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings are $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Since Sally also works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = -10.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals, then the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day for 14 days. 
Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours per day for 7 days.
Total hours played in the last week = 2 * 7 = 14 hours

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
Hours still needed to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first car: Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second car: Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car is traveling faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled:
Distance between them = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, first, we need to calculate the cost of the premium. 

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per square inch and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 square inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find the total number of S'mores they can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Marshmallows left = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To find out how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 120 minutes as well, so they will also use 6 quarters.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest is also x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Since the amount of salt and citrus zest is x, and the amount of oil is 2x, the amount of fragrance is also x.

So, the equation is: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

4. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

5. After giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Now, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Number of students = 20

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first.

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the pay per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per day = 5 * 30 = 150
Total number of tasks in a week = 150 * 7 = 1050

Pay per task = $1.20
Total pay per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

"To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 
88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of cards each person has.

Let's say PJ has x cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, she will lose:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we need to consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. So, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Milly will lose $8.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them up.

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on TikTok per week: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours

The cost of the standard items is: 
$129.00

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- The cost of the additional pictures is: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is: 
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, and Eva has $20, Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's money, we multiply Anthony's money by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's money to find Roy's money. $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to find the height Saskay can lift first, then the height Kagiyami can lift, and finally the height Naruto can lift.

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time for kangaroos = 18 hours
Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
18 = Distance / 3
Distance = 18 * 3
Distance = 54

Now we can find the time it will take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
Time for turtles = 54 / 3
Time for turtles = 18 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 18 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to first find out how many dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each of them to find the total number of dishes.

Total number of dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 (the new price of the laptop after trading in her old one) - 50 (the amount she still needs to buy the laptop).

x + 230 = 350

Now, we need to solve for x.

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used. 
For the first glue stick, 5/6 of 12 mm is 10 mm, so 1/6 of 12 mm is 2 mm. 
For the second glue stick, 1/3 of 12 mm is 4 mm, so 2/3 of 12 mm is 8 mm. 
For the third glue stick, 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm, so 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of socks Peter and Jack have, and then add them together with the number of dishes they have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2:
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2:
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing the number of dishes Jack has by 2:
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can add the number of socks and dishes they have together:
60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 120

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then:
- Your brother's age is x + 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 2.
- Your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, which means she received 90% of what Rafaela received. To find 90% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.9. 
$800 * 0.9 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Paige baked 2 loaves per hour for 5 hours, so she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so she raised 80 * 0.50 = $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10 = 500

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
Total burritos eaten = 20

Now, we subtract the total burritos eaten from the total burritos given to the students to find the leftover burritos.
Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books, Anne has y books, and Sofie has z books.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: z = y + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: y = x - 12.

We are also given that together, they have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: z + y + x = 85.

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now we can substitute y = x - 12 into this equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we need to first find out how many chickens he sold. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 300 is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

Since he sells the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he made from selling 180 chickens is 180 * 50 = $9000.

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. So, the total cost of the chickens he sold must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

To find out how much he bought each chicken for, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold: $7000 / 180 = $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that were not able to fit in pairs.

20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. 

So, the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the speed of the thingamabob. 
Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. 
We know the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. 
So, 11x = 121. 
Dividing both sides by 11, we get x = 11. 
Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. 
Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

$2"
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original wage of $10. 

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * 117 = 702

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.
Martha had 3x notebooks.

Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation:
3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

So Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has approximately 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - 2.33 = 4.67

So, Martha has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:
Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

   Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
   60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
   52 = 2x - 8

2. Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
   52 + 8 = 2x
   60 = 2x

3. Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
   x = 60 / 2
   x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

4. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles of water: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Let's start by finding out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons:
20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can subtract the pieces thrown at the red balloons to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons:
58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many yellow balloons there were:
18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them together.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They spent $11 on a cake and $7 on 2 tubs of ice cream, so the total amount spent on these items is $11 + $7 = $18.

Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons, and each balloon costs $0.5, the total amount spent on balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl had initially. 

$24 / 2 = $12.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12.

12"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

Number of students playing tennis: 6
Number of students playing volleyball: 2 * 6 = 12
Number of students playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38

Total number of students: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
= 30 * 10
= 300 lollipops

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Total slices eaten per day = Abby's slices + Josh's slices
= 2 + 4
= 6 slices per day

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):
24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 / 3 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 / 2 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water first. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:
5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$124 / $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 x 5
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 x 8
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let Peter's age be P, Paul's age be P + 10, and Jean's age be J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(P + 10) + J = 100

Substituting P = (P + 10) + J, we get:

((P + 10) + J) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

P + 10 + 2J = 100

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J:

(P + 10) + 10 + 2J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + 20 + 2J = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 40

Now, we know that P = (P + 10) + J, so we can substitute P + J = 40 into this equation:

(P + J) + 10 = 40

Subtract P + J from both sides:

10 = 0

This is a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that P = (P + 10) + J is incorrect. However, we can try to find a solution by re-examining the equations.

Let's go back to the original equations:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

(P + 10) + J = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + J = 90

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the second equation:

(P + 10) + J = 90

Subtract J from both sides:

P + 10 = 90 - J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P = 80 - J

Now, substitute P = 80 - J into the equation P + J = 90:

This is still a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that P = (P + 10) + J is incorrect. However, we can try to find a solution by re-examining the equations.

Let's go back to the original equations:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

(P + 10) + J = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + J = 90

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the second equation:

(P + 10) + J = 90

Subtract J from both sides:

P + 10 = 90 - J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P = 80 - J

Now, substitute P = 80 - J into the equation P + J = 90:

(80 - J) + J = 90

Combine like terms:

80 = 90

This is still a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that P = (P + 10) + J is incorrect. However, we can try to find a solution by re-examining the equations.

Let's go back to the original equations:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + J = 90

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the second equation:

Subtract J from both sides:

P + 10 = 90 - J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P = 80 - J

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Adding the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons, the total number of balloons is:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we need to subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the total distance spat by both, add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total money made from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6 = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6 = $192,000

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200."
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each animal needs and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There are 15 goats, so the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.
There are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars left

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, he has:
250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25:
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

"To find out how much James spent, first, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount.

The total cost of the CDs before the discount is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount.

Discount amount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the total cost after the discount.

Money James was out = Total cost after discount - Amount made
= $90 - $200
= -$110

Since James was out of money, the answer is -$110."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 5: Calculate the distance James swims at half the speed (1 mile per hour).
Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Distance = 8 miles

Step 6: Calculate the time James spends swimming 8 miles at 1 mile per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

So, Dinar scored 15 points. 

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she was awake.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total sleep time. 

She also woke up at 2:15 a.m. instead of 2:00 a.m. We need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and she usually wakes up at 6 a.m., we can calculate the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time she woke up from her usual wake-up time. 

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3:45 a.m.

Now, we need to subtract the time she went to sleep from her usual sleep time to find the time she was sleepwalking. 

10 p.m. - 3:45 a.m. = 6:15 p.m.

Now we can calculate the total minutes she slept on her bed that day. 

6:15 p.m. - 10 p.m. = 4 hours
4 hours * 60 minutes = 240 minutes

However, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those minutes to the total sleep time. 

240 minutes + 23 minutes = 263 minutes

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day.
   Total emails per day = 16
   Work emails per day = 7
   Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
   Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails per day = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.
   Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
   Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
   Emails to family per day = 6

3. Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)

Jeffrey's balls = 1

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up another equation:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

Now, we know that the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A + 4A - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

Carlton's team has 13 players, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.
2. Calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.
3. Calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 60 oranges.
4. Calculate the number of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.
5. Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 140 oranges.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Half of 50 is 25. 
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

Total cost of books = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Amount saved = $14

Amount needed = Total cost of books - Amount saved
= $39 - $14
= $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work:

Number of hours = Amount needed / Hourly wage
= $25 / $5
= 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries (60) and subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday, we need to follow the given information:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150
Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $90 = $180

Total earnings for two days: $150 + $180 = $330

The final answer is: $330"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32 / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - 40% of the price of the blue car
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

2. We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

3. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.

4. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get D = 48.

5. We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

6. We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get B = 12.

7. Now we have the current ages of Emil (19), his dad (48), and his brother (12).

8. To find the sum of their ages, we add the three ages together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day:

- Thursday: 3 pounds
- Friday: 4 times Thursday's amount = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds
- Saturday: half of Friday's amount = 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, the space between each plant is 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

Now, we subtract the space between plants from the total length of the bed: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit: 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5.

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can multiply 18 by 1/2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63 pretzels per week

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

Cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that by 3.

Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel 30 shrimp.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, it will take her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp.

So, it will take her 5 minutes to peel and 10 minutes to cook, for a total of 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to peel and cook 30 shrimp.

To find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 15 minutes by 3: 15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

2. The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. It ran on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was off for 2 hours, so it warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

5. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we need to find out how many years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet.
4. Let's assume the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is x. Then, Bill saw the comet x + 75 years after his dad saw it.
5. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was 90 years old, so we can set up the equation: x + 75 = 90.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 15.
7. Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet: 30 + 15 = 45 years old.
8. Now, we know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3 * 45 = 135 years old.

So, Bill was 135 - 75 = 60 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This amount will be subtracted from the total amount collected, so the new total is $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Now, Walter's lawyer will contribute 3 times the new total amount, which is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide 750 by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, the adult slices are 2 times the size of the kid slices. Let's assume the size of a kid's slice is y. Then, the size of an adult's slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 2 kid slices and 4 adult slices, the total size is:

2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y

Now, we know that the total size of the watermelon is 10y, and we want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2 slices, the total size of the adult slices is 2(2y) = 4y.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, divide the size of the adult slices by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

So, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm."
"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by both Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold and multiply it by the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons for a month.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost, which is $480.

480"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

Final answer: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge can't be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's recheck the calculation for the last 3 hours:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:

"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he has spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $0, he can't buy any plums.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

780 / 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages.

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he reads:

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The hotel initially had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4): 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2:
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
18 * 0.5 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x.
2. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.
3. The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
4. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'y' large stuffed animals and '2y' small stuffed animals.
5. The total amount earned from the sales is $120.
6. The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 3x * y.
7. The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2y = 8y.
8. The total amount earned is the sum of the amount earned from large and small stuffed animals: 3x * y + 8y = 120.
9. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x, we can substitute 3x with 3 * 4 = 12 (since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4).
10. Now the equation becomes: 12y + 8y = 120.
11. Combine like terms: 20y = 120.
12. Divide both sides by 20: y = 6.

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

Final answer: $300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by the friends from the total number of eggs.

The twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 10 eggs that were not found by the friends.

So, the total number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"To find the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

There are 30 days in a month, so the total amount of ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $1.50 * 8 = $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he got from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the number of red balloons remaining:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

4. Calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining:
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

6. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
   15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: 80%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, he can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small beans.

The final answer is 450."
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Total daily income: $15 per day
Total daily expenses: $3 per day

Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216

Jury pay per hour: $216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour

Final answer: $12"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box and then divide by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of boxes: 2
Number of apples in each box: 40

Total number of apples: 2 * 40 = 80
Number of packs: 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 2 x $11 = $22.
Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
$50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year, so the total amount of money he lost is:
$50,000 x 4 = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
He had a $25,000 per year job before college, and his college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:
$25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years, the total amount of money he earned is:
$75,000 x 4 = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school:
$200,000 (lost money) + $50,000 (loans) = $250,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$250,000 / $75,000 = 3.33 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 3.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 3.33"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: $576.67"
"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team:
3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 7 days:
9 hours/day * 7 days = 63 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours per painter

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. 

We can write the equation: 
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the books are written in German, so there are 10% of 50 = 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The increased cost is $72. To find the total cost, we add the increased cost to the normal cost:

$120 + $72 = $192

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched.

Total trucks dispatched = 20
Trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. We know that 5 trucks could not deliver, so the number of trucks that delivered is:
20 - 5 = 15

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the promotion.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy, we divide the total amount of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3.

Since each set costs $4.00, and Dennis needs 3 sets, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * 60 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had.
$120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
10 * 7 = 70 bananas
14 * 7 = 98 bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 - 168 = 147 bananas

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats:
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since she bought a dozen (12) roses for $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Total amount of money she has = $25
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, she will not have enough money to buy the roses. However, if we assume she has enough money, we can calculate the change:
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:
$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and add them together.

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time from the first train's arrival to its departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can set up the equation:

$2666.67 * 1.20 = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price.

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the sale price is higher than the original price, so Mr. Rogers' friend actually paid more than the original price. The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 20% off the original price.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours, and then multiply that number by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 times the number created by one spring in 4 hours, which is 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

Frankie's score is 195."
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually:
10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas
40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= 67500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= 11250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= 52500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= 67500 + 11250 + 52500
= 132500

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

So, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 + 540 = 1620 kilograms.

"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 9 (unshaken sodas) = 10.

So, the likelihood is 1/10 or 10%.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so if we let the total number of jellyfish be x, then the number of large jellyfish is x/5.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.
3. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.
4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the amount she saves as a percentage of her income.

$20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20% of her income.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will save the same amount each year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for 20 years, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

However, we need to know how much she needs to save for 20 years. Assuming she wants to save the same amount each year, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will save $20,000 per year.

To find the total amount she needs to save, we can multiply the amount she saves per year by the number of years she wants to save for.

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need 20 years to save $400,000.

However, this is the amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to save, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for the same amount of time to earn the same amount.

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save $400,000.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the total miles per day she needs to hike.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total amount received: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate a quarter of 12 kg for Pierre and 1/3 of 12 kg for Paul.

A quarter of 12 kg is 12 / 4 = 3 kg for Pierre.

1/3 of 12 kg is 12 / 3 = 4 kg for Paul.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

Since the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can divide 5 minutes by 255 to find the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

Time per blink = 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks to find the total time.

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fish:
Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish:

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by 2 (since he visits twice a month).

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

70 / 2 = 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the 5th worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam was twice as old as Vince two years ago, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age 2 years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

2. We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

3. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So, C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

4. Since C = S + 12, we can substitute this into the equation C + S = 30, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

5. Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

6. Since C = S + 12, we can substitute S = 9 into this equation, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

7. We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

8. Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

9. Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, since each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the number of logs he can make and then the number of planks from each log, and finally the total amount he earns.

1. Number of logs: 
   Since John can make logs from 80% of the tree, he can make 80% of 80 feet.
   80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet
   Since each log is 4 feet, the number of logs he can make is:
   64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

2. Number of planks:
   Since each log is cut into 5 planks, the total number of planks is:
   16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

3. Total earnings:
   Since each plank is sold for $1.2, the total earnings are:
   80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, which is 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we need to find their combined salary first. Valerie's salary is $5000 and her brother's salary is $10,000, so their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Now, their mother's salary is twice their combined salary, which is 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 40 minutes is spent on the beach. 

Time = Distance / Speed
We don't know the speed, but we know that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach. Let's call the speed on the beach 'x'. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x.

We know that 2 miles is walked at a speed of x, so the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We also know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We also know that the total distance is 3 miles, so we can set up the equation:

2 + 1 = 3
2 + 1 = 3

This equation is true, so we can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk and the time it takes to walk on the beach:

40 + 30/x = total time

We don't know the total time, but we know that the total time is equal to the time it takes to walk 3 miles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach and the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

(2/x) * 60 + (1/(2x)) * 60 = 3

We can simplify this equation:

120/x + 30/x = 3

Combine like terms:

150/x = 3

Multiply both sides by x:

150 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

50 = x

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = 30/x = 30/50 = 0.6 minutes

Now we can find the total time:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 0.6
Total time = 40.6 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:
$4 x 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob has 36 marbles initially.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. The total amount of water is 5 ounces, so the amount of water in the other mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Since the amount of water in the other mug is 1 ounce, the temperature of the water in the other mug is also 1 ounce. 

We know that the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, and the temperature of the water in the other mug is x degrees. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the average temperature of the water is (33 + x) / 2. 

We also know that the average temperature of the water is at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 >= 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x >= 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides:

x >= 47

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to calculate the total cost first. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs. 
Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell pays. 
Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
6 - 3 = 3 scoops
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we are told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
Since 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, we can divide 18 scoops by 2 to find out how many scoops of potatoes Gomer ate.
18 / 2 = 9 scoops

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, so we can multiply 9 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.
9 * 3 = 27 potatoes

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the number of men is 5 parts, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 84

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 16.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 16.8 to 16 (as you can't have 0.8 of a person). 

Now, we know that the number of men is 5x = 5 * 16 = 80. 

The number of women is 9x = 9 * 16 = 144, but we know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up another equation:

9x + 5x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now we know that the number of women is 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

100 rocks * $5/rock = $500

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 100 rocks, which is:
60% of 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so the total amount he earns is:
60 rocks * $7/rock = $420

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:
Total cost - Total earnings = Loss
$500 - $420 = $80

Adam loses $80.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, the total cost for one fish for the entire month would be:

31 days * $1/day = $31

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all of them for the entire month would be:

$31 * 3 = $93

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Number of roses left = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother
= 30 - 24
= 6

Then, we add the number of roses she bought:
= 6 + 15
= 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The final answer is 50."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person collected.

Let's start by finding out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Carlos collected x seashells. Then, Jim collected x + 5 seashells.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's say Carrey collected y seashells. Then, we can set up the equation:

22 = 2y

Solving for y, we get:

y = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.

Dividing 60 seashells equally among the three people, we get:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:
60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices = 6 * $40 = $240

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, the answer is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers) 
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= (number of purple wearers) / (number of purple wearers + number of blue wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75
= 75%

The final answer is 75."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received in the first two days and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received in the first two days = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received in the first two days from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land. The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

Abraham initially earned $50 + $30 = $80 from the first two sales. He then earned an additional $60 from the last sale. In total, he earned $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of eggs found, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person found:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we need to first find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much money Rissa was given. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

1/5 of $15 is $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Now, Rissa had $15 and gave $3 to her sister. So, she is left with $15 - $3 = $12.

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money, but the problem doesn't mention Ronnie giving any money to her sister. Therefore, Ronnie still has the $5 she was given initially.

The final answer is $5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since there are four colors in total, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We also know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

Now, we know that the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors. So, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 'x', which is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the total number of clouds counted across all five days:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find the number of cycles, we need to first find the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, we can divide $1 by the cost of one pod:

Cost of one pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12
= 8.33 cycles

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

Final answer: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since $1000 / $20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45

Since 0.45 is equal to the amount of chalk used on Monday, we can set up an equation:

0.20 * (2.25 - 0.45x) = 0.45

Simplifying the equation:

0.20 * 2.25 - 0.20 * 0.45x = 0.45

0.45 - 0.09x = 0.45

Subtracting 0.45 from both sides:

-0.09x = 0

Dividing both sides by -0.09:

x = 5

So, the teacher will have 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Since he has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school can get.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out how many books each school can get.

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

6 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 14 pizzas

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

4. Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the beginning of the third day.

So, the nurses started with 93 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 93"
"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each activity and then add them together.

- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 x $0.50 = $3.00
- He did his laundry once, so he earned $3.00
- He took the trash out twice, so he earned 2 x $0.75 = $1.50
- He cleaned his room once, so he earned $1.50

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a single shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to get the amount of blood a shark has: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them together.

1. The first 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total is now 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. So, the total is now 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens = 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens

Total number of pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were drunk, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

The equation is: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the height of the first floor: 
   Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, 
   the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

2. Then, we find the height of the second floor: 
   Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, 
   the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

3. Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor: 
   The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, 
   which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first.

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. 

Half of 10 diaper changes is 10 / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, first, calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Since he is traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

There were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To find the total amount Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 52.

Weekly cost:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00
Total weekly cost: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is:
$10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Final answer: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost:
Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.
So, the total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total number of eggs:
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total selling price:
Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He found 1 bead, but it wasn't a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers.
Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16.
The total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first find out how many calls he deals with in a day. 

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many calls he deals with in an hour.

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Since Tim works 6 hours a day, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with per hour by the number of hours he works per day.

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with per day by the number of days he works per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the land distance and the water distance separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

The land distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.
The water distance is also 100 yards.

Time taken to cover the land distance = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.
Time taken to cover the water distance = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speaking speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped from the residual heat is 10.

Now, let's add the total number of kernels popped and the number of kernels popped from the residual heat:
200 + 10 = 210 kernels

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons needed for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."

"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is given as 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. 

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Now, we add 2 hours to this half to find Anna's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, the total cost will be:
6 * 2 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

Total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40
Total income from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40
Total income: $40 + $40 = $80

Total cost of trays: 5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Total expenses: $20

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income:
$80 - $20 = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The original 5 children are already following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck.

25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals.

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Meals left = Total meals - Meals given out
Meals left = 1,360 - 142
Meals left = 1,218

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16. 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 

12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is:
15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is:
1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga per week is:
5 hours * 4 weeks = 20 hours

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
30 minutes * 4 weeks = 120 minutes
120 minutes * 4 = 480 minutes

Converting the total time from minutes to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"".

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce:
5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is:
70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 x $8 = $16.
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4.
- So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4.
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16.
- The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we can divide $13 by $6.50 to find out how many tickets he can buy:
13 / 6.50 = 2

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
3. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
4. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.
5. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29 (total items).
6. However, we know that Igor lost some beakers, so we need to subtract the number of beakers he had from the total number of beakers he should have had. Let's call the number of beakers he lost 'x'. Then, the correct number of beakers is 7 - x.
7. We can set up the equation: 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 31 - x = 29.
9. Solving for x, we get: x = 2.

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and she ran 4 miles, we can divide 4 by 2 to find the distance Aaron ran. 

4 / 2 = 2 miles

Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find his speed by dividing the time by the distance.

Speed = Time / Distance
Speed = 16 / 2
Speed = 8 minutes per mile

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time by multiplying her distance by her speed.

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes

Cost per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit.
Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they start at the same time, we can assume that they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute. 

Let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges (since she has already peeled one orange in the first minute), and Jane will peel x oranges.

We can continue this pattern, and we can see that Ana will peel x - 1, x - 2, x - 3, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Jane will peel x, x, x, x, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane will be the same in each subsequent minute.

Let's calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Ana will peel x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) + ... + 1 oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of 1, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + 1)
Sum = 30 * (x + 1)

Jane will peel x + x + x + ... + x oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of x, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + x)
Sum = 30 * 2x
Sum = 60x

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is the difference between the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Ana and the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

Difference = 30 * (x + 1) - 60x
= 30x + 30 - 60x
= -30x + 30

Since x is the number of oranges peeled in the first minute, x must be a positive integer. 

However, the difference -30x + 30 is negative for all positive values of x. This means that Ana will peel fewer oranges than Jane after an hour.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: 0"
"To find the cost of the new radiator, Mark gets 80% off the original price of $400. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 
So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The number of cows is 20 - 5 = 15.
