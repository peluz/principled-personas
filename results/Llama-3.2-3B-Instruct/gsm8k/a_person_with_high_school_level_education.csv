"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then how many she sells.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she uses 4 eggs for baking. Now she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs in a week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out the total amount of feed she has given to her chickens so far.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
15 cups / 20 chickens = 0.75 cups per chicken

In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
25 cups / 20 chickens = 1.25 cups per chicken

Now, we need to add the amount of feed per chicken for both meals. 
0.75 cups + 1.25 cups = 2 cups per chicken

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we multiply the amount of feed per chicken by the number of chickens. 
2 cups per chicken * 20 chickens = 40 cups

So, Wendi needs 40 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The first glass costs $5.
The remaining 15 glasses cost 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.
The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 = 120 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download 60% of the file.

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download the remaining 40% of the file.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the entire file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, we add up the distances: 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

So, John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Final answer: 315"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime rate) = 5 * 12 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the profit per year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90.
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons and can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.
The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The annual profit is the revenue minus the cost: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90. To do this, we divide the initial cost by the annual profit: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine the x terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + x/3 + 2 = 5

Combine the constants:

-2 + 2 = 0

Combine the x terms:

x - x/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x - x = 10

Combine the x terms:

x = 10

So Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial price: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
New price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial price: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
New price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4 to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we need to find the total time she needs to spend to cover the entire 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to cover the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. To find the required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of water to the 24 liters of pineapple drink. Since 24 liters is equal to 24/1, we can rewrite it as 24/1 = 24. 

Now we add 24/1 and 26/3. To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 3. We can rewrite 24 as 72/3. 

Now we can add: 72/3 + 26/3 = 98/3 liters.

The final answer is: 32.67"
"To find the answer, we need to know the age of Raymond. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age:

Raymond's age - son's age = years since son's birth
25 - 23 = 2

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.

Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 servings by 15 to find out how many cartons she will buy:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then add the distance from his second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance before the second stop = Total distance - Distance traveled before the first stop
Distance before the second stop = 60 - 20
Distance before the second stop = 40 miles

Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = Distance to the end - Distance from the second stop
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 40
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 20 miles

Now, we add the distance before the second stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip to find the total distance between the first and second stops.
Total distance between the first and second stops = Distance before the second stop + Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
Total distance between the first and second stops = 40 + 20
Total distance between the first and second stops = 60 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 7x + 11x = 18x. 

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation 18x = 162. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 18: x = 162 / 18 = 9.

Now that we know x, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 
Darrell's age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63.
Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the sum by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know he had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. The question asks how many Lego sets he still has, but it doesn't say he sold any more. So, the answer is 13.

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. 
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving: 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams.

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips.

Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs:
20 candles * 1 pound = 20 pounds of beeswax
The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is:
20 pounds * $10.00 = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The negative sign indicates that Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

Total notes = 80 + 220 = 300

Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can find the number of notes in the package by subtracting the remaining notes from the total notes.

Notes in the package = Total notes - Remaining notes
= 300 - 23
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is:

40 * 1.5 = 60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost per tie:

10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:

200 + 600 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of 120 units. 

3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

So, 90 units are occupied. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 

120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 
252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
147 dozen * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 per week."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the same formula, but this time we will divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days: 
$520 (Thursday) > $480 (Friday)

The mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we multiply 12 by 3 to get 36. 

Now, we add the 7 adopted kittens to the 36 kittens from Patchy and the 12 kittens from Trixie. 

36 (from Patchy) + 7 (adopted) + 12 (from Trixie) = 55

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so we subtract 2 from 30:
30 - 2 = 28

Now, Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops (28) by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14
Total money Peter has: $42

Now, let's divide the total money by the cost of the ticket and popcorn:
$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight available for boxes by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes:

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of clusters and the individual fruit.

There are 6 clusters with 20 fruit each, so 6 x 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual fruit, we get 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the bad and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 3 oranges

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe and bad/sour oranges from the total number of oranges: 
25 - 5 (unripe) - 3 (bad/sour) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

Janet paid $1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years separately.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension value is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500. 

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500.

Final answer: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = 840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find 10% of 140, we multiply 140 by 0.1:
140 * 0.1 = 14

So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = 126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = 756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service:
840 + 756 = 1596

The final answer is: 1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles per gallon."
"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the total hours per week by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach, so the total number of coaches is 1 coach per school * 4 schools = 4 coaches.

The total number of people is the sum of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the total number of gems: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. 

Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since there's a 2% interest for each unit, we need to calculate the interest for each month. The interest for the first month is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total amount to be paid for the first month is $150 (cost) + $3 (interest) = $153.

For the second month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. The total amount to be paid for the second month is $150 + $3 = $153.

For the third month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. The total amount to be paid for the third month is $150 + $3 = $153.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much laundry David does and then compare it to Raymond's amount.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find out how much David does.

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find out how much Raymond does.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. We can write this as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x is the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold by 11 (since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's).

Let's do the math:

Total copies sold = 88,000
Marilyn's copies = 10x
Harald's copies = x

Since Marilyn's copies sold 10 times as many as Harald's, we can write an equation:
10x + x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8,000"
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests since 1/4 don't show up. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply 12 by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost of each gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * 2 = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate the amount of potato salad each adult and child will eat, then add them together.

An adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

A child eats half as much as an adult, so a child eats 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children together: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets the three have: 
4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's say Gerald's original time is x seconds. Then, Lee's time would be x - 2 seconds.

We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 38

To solve for x, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 38 + 2
x = 40

So, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Now, we add 4 seconds to his original time:

40 + 4 = 44

So, Gerald's new time is 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, we need to multiply the final volume of the sauce by 2.

32 ounces (final volume) * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used.

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, and there were originally 30 cars. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

Then, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 1 * 40 = 40 plants.

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she already has: 80 - 40 = 40.

So, Mary will have 40 potted plants left."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. To do that, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 110 - 10
2x = 100

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 100 / 2
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas, we need to multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons.

Cost per gallon: $3.00
Number of gallons: 10

Total cost = Cost per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost = $3.00 * 10
Total cost = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the cashback rewards:
Cashback per gallon: $0.20
Number of gallons: 10

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost:
Total cost - Total cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each person.

For Beatrice: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups they ate: 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet to reach the shore. 

Since the shore is 64 feet away, and Julia rows 20 feet at a time, we divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2. Since Julia can't row a fraction of a time, we round down to 3 times. 

So, Julia rows 3 times of 20 feet, which is 60 feet. 

Now, we need to find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 60 feet. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we multiply 16 by 3 to get 48 seconds.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in 60 feet. We divide 60 by 10 to get 6. 

Now, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 liters of water taken on by the boat.

The final answer is 12."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many birds are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

Now, subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The total amount John paid is $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary:
Adrien's current salary = Adrien's old salary + 40% of Adrien's old salary
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's current salary = $56,000

Now, we can find their total salary four years later:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

So, Jennie puts 20 stamps on the letters needing stamps. This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters increases by 20.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in that pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract 20 from 30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is x.

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of x spoons, so she had x spoons.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We know that she had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time:

   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   10 elves quit from the 40 remaining, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

The number of elves left is 30."
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May: $500
Expenditure in June: $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = $500 + $440 = $940

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the luge.

Now, let's add up the total number of tickets used:
12 (Pam's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (Fred's roller coaster tickets) + 12 (luge tickets) = 48 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 48."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. We also know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked. 

41 (total miles) - 4 (Monday miles) - 24 (Tuesday miles) = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

Total cost per year: $60 * 12 = $720

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we multiply Brian's current number of video games by 3 and subtract 5.

3 * 15 = 45
45 - 5 = 40

Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we multiply 27 by 1/3.
   27 * 1/3 = 9

2. Now, we know that 9 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply 9 by 2/3.
   9 * 2/3 = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To find the total cost of the order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the number of questions by the time taken: 
75 questions * 8 hours = 600 questions completed.

Since Mark completed 5 questions per hour, we can find the time taken for the second test by dividing the total questions by the rate:
100 questions / 5 questions per hour = 20 hours.

However, Mark only had 6 hours to complete the second test. So, he completed 5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions in the second test.

To find the total questions completed, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
600 questions + 30 questions = 630 questions completed.

Since the total questions in both tests are 75 + 100 = 175 questions, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions to find the questions left incomplete:
175 questions - 630 questions = -455 questions.

However, this is incorrect as we cannot have a negative number of questions. The correct approach is to subtract the total questions completed from the total questions in both tests:
175 questions - 630 questions = -455 questions.

Let's recalculate the total questions completed:
600 questions + 30 questions = 630 questions.

Since Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second test, we can find the total time taken:
8 hours + 6 hours = 14 hours.

Now, we can find the total questions Mark can complete in 14 hours:
5 questions per hour * 14 hours = 70 questions.

Since Mark completed 630 questions, we subtract the total questions he can complete in 14 hours from the total questions:
630 questions - 70 questions = 560 questions.

Now, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions in both tests:
175 questions - 560 questions = -385 questions.

However, this is still incorrect. We should find the total questions Mark completed in 14 hours:
5 questions per hour * 14 hours = 70 questions.

Now, we subtract the total questions Mark completed from the total questions in both tests:
175 questions - 70 questions = 105 questions.

Since Mark completed 105 questions, we subtract this from the total questions in both tests:
175 questions - 105 questions = 70 questions.

The correct answer is 70 questions."
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of queens. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, we can represent the number of queens as x. This means there are 2x babies.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, the number of worker bees is 2 times the number of babies, which is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700. This includes the queens, babies, and worker bees. So, we can set up the equation:

x (queens) + 2x (babies) + 4x (worker bees) = 700

Combine like terms:

7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queens, we can find the number of babies:

2x = 2 * 100 = 200

And the number of worker bees:

4x = 4 * 100 = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, in 14 hours he would earn 14 * 10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the tax on non-food items first. 

Non-food items:

Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, let's add the tax to the non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11

Now, we add the cost of food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food cost: $2 + $3 = $5

Total cost: $11 (non-food) + $5 (food) = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit: Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

The total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 30 that left fly from the hive and leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. So, after the next 18 hours, the total number of bees that left is 45 + 60 = 105 bees.
6. Now, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. Since 105 bees left, and 45 bees had already returned, 105 - 45 = 60 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since you can't have a negative number of fries, this means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull ate. We'll ignore this part and continue with the information we have.

6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, but we don't know how many fries were left after the pigeons ate. Let's assume the remaining fries after the pigeons ate were x. Then, the raccoon ate 2/3 * x fries.
7. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are x - 2/3 * x = 1/3 * x.
8. Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 1/3 * x - 1 fries.
9. We know that 1/3 * x - 1 = 5. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides: 1/3 * x = 6. Then, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 18.

So, there were 18 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total number of hours is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to follow the given information. 

Ethel has $8. 
Jimmy has 2 more than twice the money Ethel has. 
So, we need to multiply Ethel's money by 2 and then add 2. 
2 * 8 = 16 
16 + 2 = 18 

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 x 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 days in a weekend, so he walks 2 x 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so they have 80 * 8 = 640 legs.
Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so they have 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since Sally Four is 8 years old, and Sally Two is 19 years old, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the total age of the two older birds. However, we don't have the total age of the two older birds. 

We can find the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red by adding their ages: 19 + 16 = 35 years.

Now, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red from the total age of all four birds. However, we still don't have the total age of all four birds.

We can find the age of the fourth bird by adding the ages of Sally Four and the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red: 8 + 35 = 43 years.

Now we have the age of the fourth bird, which is 43 years.

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 43 = 86 years.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

Now, let's multiply the new monthly payment by 12 to find the yearly payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato: 1.5 + 5 = 6.5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60:
60 * 6.5 = 390 seconds

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
390 / 60 = 6.5 minutes

So, it will take Billy 6.5 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they sell each gallon for $10 and it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since they made $25 in profit, and the profit is the revenue minus the cost, we can set up the equation:

$10 (revenue per gallon) - $5 (cost per gallon) = $25 (profit)

However, this equation doesn't make sense because the profit is the difference between the revenue and the total cost, not just the cost of lemons. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's assume they made x gallons of lemonade. The total revenue is $10x and the total cost is $5x. The profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5x = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

x = 5

So they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese people. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese people and 240 total people. So, the number of Chinese people is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people. 

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese people - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60

"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

3. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   1500 + 2000 = 3500

4. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
   6000 - 3500 = 2500

5. Calculate the amount donated to charity:
   Half of 2500 = 0.5 * 2500 = 1250

6. Calculate the amount left after donation:
   2500 - 1250 = 1250

7. Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:
   200 + 700 = 900

8. Calculate the final amount left:
   1250 - 900 = 350

The final amount Zaid will have is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. 
Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 
Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has 36 crabs, and Rani has 46 crabs. 
Total number of crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in total, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours. 
So, his earnings for the first week are 10 * 5 = $50.

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours. 
So, his earnings for the second week are 10 * 8 = $80.

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can multiply the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

3/4 * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes. 

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (rolling 4, 5, or 6) and divide it by the total possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (rolling 2, 4, or 6) and divide it by the total possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 3/6 or 1/2.

Since both probabilities are equal (1/2), the difference between them is 0.

However, to express it as a percentage, we can multiply by 100.

0 * 100 = 0%

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide her mom's apples by 2, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, so Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out the total number of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the remaining straw by 6 to find out the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages, we divide the total number of rats by 3 to find out the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

"To calculate the interest, we need to first find out the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.

Total interest = Interest for one month * Number of months
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total selling price. 

Total selling price = $30 per bag
Total profit = $400
Total selling price - Total profit = Total cost
$30 - $400 = -$370 (This means the trader actually lost $370)

Since the trader lost money, we need to add the cost of transportation to find the total cost. 

Cost of transportation per bag = $2
Total cost = Total cost of bags + Cost of transportation
Let's say the number of bags is x.
Total cost of bags = $20x
Total cost = $20x + $2x
Total cost = $22x

We know the total cost is -$370, so we can set up the equation:
$22x = -$370

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 22:
x = -$370 / 22
x = -16.82 (round down to -17, since you can't sell a fraction of a bag)

However, since the number of bags cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's recheck the calculation:
Total cost = Total cost of bags + Cost of transportation
$22x = $20x + $2x
$22x = $22x

This means the total cost is equal to the total selling price, which is not possible. 

However, we can try to find the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
Profit per bag = $30 - $20 = $10
Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $400 / $10
Number of bags sold = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the number of trees he planted and the number of trees he chopped down over the 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so over 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so over 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

So, Tom has 15 trees left.

25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   So, the cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she can earn $60 in 12 babysitting sessions, she can afford the jacket and shoes in 12 sessions. However, she needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the same amount. 

So, she needs to mow the lawn 15 - 12 = 3 more times.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Since w = r + 2, we can substitute this into the equation 3r + 5w to get 3r + 5(r + 2). This simplifies to 3r + 5r + 10, which is 8r + 10.

Now we know that 8r + 10 = 42. To solve for r, we need to isolate r. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 8r = 32. Dividing both sides by 8 gives us r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time he spends walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find out how many customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so it lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. The big pool also lost 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so it lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it now has 2x - 16 gallons. The small pool lost 16 gallons, so it now has x - 16 gallons.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides, we get:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

x = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, it now has:

x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 gallons

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy from her hourly wage.

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

44"
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the information given.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we have the ages of all three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age = (21 + 42 + 63) / 3
Average age = 126 / 3
Average age = 42

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66

Now, we can find the average age in three years:
Average age in three years = (Harriet's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Adrian's age in three years) / 3
Average age in three years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in three years = 135 / 3
Average age in three years = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34.
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial 36 watermelons from the total.

120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons.

3/4 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we need to subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of minutes in a week by the number of minutes it takes him to write one page to find out how many hours he spends writing per week. 

30 pages per week / 6 pages per minute = 5 minutes per page
5 minutes per page * 30 pages per week = 150 minutes per week
150 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 2.5 hours per week

4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave him x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

The final answer is 27."
"To find the number of apps Travis has now, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the number of apps he had initially, then add the number of new apps he downloaded.

Initial number of apps: 61
Number of apps deleted: 9
Number of new apps downloaded: 18

First, subtract the number of apps deleted from the initial number: 61 - 9 = 52
Then, add the number of new apps downloaded: 52 + 18 = 70

Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to multiply his starting floor (3) by 4 and add 6.

3 * 4 = 12
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Now, he divides the 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall, we divide 240 by 20.

240 / 20 = 12

So, there are 12 cows in each stall. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8.

12 * 8 = 96

The final answer is 96."
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to first find the total weight of the wood. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount Nancy owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has:
44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has:
48 / 2 = 24 bananas

Now, let's add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits is:
52 + 24 = 76

The final answer is: 76"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12 (since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies).

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
Total cookies = 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 12.
66 cookies / 12 = 5.5

So Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

5.5"
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

9,300 * 2/3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to add the marbles she already had (5 boxes * 50 marbles per box) to the marbles she got from her friend (20 marbles).

First, let's calculate the marbles she already had: 
5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Then, let's add the marbles she got from her friend: 
250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Maddison now has 270 marbles.

270"
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. We know that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find out how much all three girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes + 40% of 20 minutes
   40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
   Total time for heating the oil to the desired temperature = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to the desired temperature
   Time to cook the chicken = 28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Total time = 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we multiply that by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows.

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body, collar, and rosette take 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. 
To find out how many stitches the two sleeves take, we subtract the total stitches of the body, collar, and rosette from the total stitches of the sweater: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches of the sleeves by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines from each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines are Sean's, he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the number of cards with the letter A: 
   2/5 of 80 cards = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards

2. Now, find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A:
   80 - 32 = 48 cards

3. Next, find the number of cards with the letter B:
   1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards

4. Now, find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter B:
   48 - 24 = 24 cards

5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter C:
   5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards

6. Now, find the number of cards with the letter D:

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. 

Let's say Mico's current age is M and Marco's current age is M + 1 (since the sum of their ages is 20). 

We can write the equation: 
M + (M + 1) = 20

Combine like terms: 
2M + 1 = 20

Subtract 1 from both sides: 
2M = 19

Divide both sides by 2: 
M = 9.5

So, Mico's current age is 9.5 and Marco's current age is 9.5 + 1 = 10.5.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be 9.5 + 10 = 19.5 and Marco's age will be 10.5 + 10 = 20.5.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 19.5 + 20.5 = 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expand the equation: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18.

Divide both sides by 3: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid.
$5 + $2 = $7.

The total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. 
The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.
The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, the total number of people is 15 + 30 = 45.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in a necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week: 
40 (Alani) + 80 (Braylen) + 120 (Margot) = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week:
20 (Alani) + 40 (Braylen) + 60 (Margot) = 120 stories in the first week.
Adding this to the 240 stories from the second week: 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have in total. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. 

So, 39 = 10 * x / 10. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 10. 
39 * 10 = 10 * x 
390 = 10x 

Now, divide both sides by 10. 
390 / 10 = x 
x = 39

The final answer is 39."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * 5 = $75.

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."

"To find the total distance John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Distance to work and back is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven per year = 15000 miles
Total cost of driving per year = 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000

John also gets a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

Total cost per year = Total cost of driving per year + Total bonus per year
Total cost per year = $30000 + $1800
Total cost per year = $31800

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how many new limbs the person will grow, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs they will get in 15 days.

Since the person gets an extra arm every 3 days, we divide 15 by 3 to find out how many extra arms they will get: 15 ÷ 3 = 5.

Since the person gets an extra leg every 5 days, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many extra legs they will get: 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The person will grow 8 new limbs in 15 days.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

Cost of 6 business suits: 6 * $100 = $600
Cost of 3 suitcases: 3 * $50 = $150
Cost of a flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Total cost of items purchased so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo has $6000 and wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left.

To find out how much he has to spend on gifts, we subtract the total cost of items purchased from the amount he has left: $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person eats in a week and then add them up.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family, which is 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs eaten per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Cera was half as old as Noah, we can set up an equation to find Noah's age six years ago. Let's call Noah's age six years ago 'x'. Since Cera was half as old as Noah six years ago, we can write the equation as:

Cera's age six years ago = (1/2) * Noah's age six years ago
46 = (1/2) * x
x = 46 * 2
x = 92

So, Noah was 92 years old six years ago.

2. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can write the equation as:

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 92
Population of Chile six years ago = 276,000

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the equation as:

Population of Chile six years ago = (1/2) * Population of Chile now
276,000 = (1/2) * Population of Chile now
Population of Chile now = 276,000 * 2
Population of Chile now = 552,000

The final answer is: 552,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16 people.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14 people.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and Solomon bought 20 marbles, we multiply 20 by 2/5.

2/5 * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles.

3. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles in the store.

20 + 8 = 28

4. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by 2 to find the total weight.

28 * 2 = 56

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 56kgs.

56"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total cost = $12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 
30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of sets of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since there is 1 electric pole for every 3 electric wires, there are 15 electric poles. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 

1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men. 

Number of men who left = 1/4 of 40 = 10

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 10 = 15

Since 15 men stayed, and we know that 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is 22 - 15 = 7.

Therefore, 7 women are left at the party.

7"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26 (total pencils Jam has). 

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 26.

Now, let's add Meg's pencils to Jam's pencils. 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the weakening caused by the added cream. The problem states that adding any liquid weakens the coffee, but it doesn't specify the exact amount of weakening per milliliter. However, we can assume that the weakening is proportional to the amount of added liquid. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, we can assume that the weakening is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got and then divide that by 2 to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we multiply 5 by 7 to find the total number of new records: 5 * 7 = 35.

Now, we divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records: 35 / 2 = 17.5.

Since you can't trade half a record, we round down to 17 old records.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after subtracting the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the second stop: 
8 people got in.

Now, let's subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 
20 - 7 = 13

Since 5 people got on at the first stop, we need to add those to the result: 
13 + 5 = 18

So, 18 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The customer spent $80 initially.
2. They used their rewards for $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.
3. The rewards are $1 off for every $20, so 4 rewards would be $4 off.
4. However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.
5. Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the initial amount: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total tax amount first. 

Total tax for Job A = 20% of $15 * 2000 hours = 0.20 * 15 * 2000 = $6000
Net pay for Job A = $15 * 2000 - $6000 = $30,000

For Job B, we need to calculate the net income first. 

Net income for Job B = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax on net income for Job B = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * 36,000 = $3600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3600 = $30,600

Since $30,600 is greater than $30,000, Job B has a higher net pay rate. 

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $30,600 - $30,000 = $600."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that number by 2.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50%
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + $4 = $12
Decrease in the second year: 25%
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - (25% of $12) = $12 - $3 = $9

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. 

Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students. 

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, we can set up the equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

So, the smallest group has 105 students.

105"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has.

We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's say the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens will be 2x.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's find out how many legs the animals have. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. 

The total number of legs is:

- Week 1: 3 balls
- Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
- Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
- Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the information given:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
- The total weight of the animals is 50 (frog) + 50 (beetle) + 50 (toad) + 60 (snake) + 30 (bird) = 240 pounds.
- The container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from tractors and silos separately.

Earnings from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day
Earnings from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original earnings and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now. 

The final answer is: 10"

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time he spent on each activity.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his time was spent sightseeing. We can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 40%:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she earned from her jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs to her initial savings: $80 + $200 + $75 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, we need to subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone to find out how much she still needs to save: $400 - $355 = $45.

Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
2. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.
3. The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gives him an extra $10. So, Dean now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

1. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost for mini-golf is $5.
2. She also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens.
3. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10. So, the cost for go-karts is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents or $1.

Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. 
   He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

2. Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left. 
   This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

3. Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

4. The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5).
   $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

1.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, we need to solve for x. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2:
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities.

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance by the service interval.

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 675 miles is less than 18,000 miles, so the train will need service after the first trip.

So, the train will need service after 1 day."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a bed for a collie takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the beds:

- 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
- 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds

Total amount of stuffing needed: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip to his friend's house, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

To find the time taken for the trip back home, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip: 2.86 + 3 = 5.86 hours

The trip took 5.86 hours."
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students:
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade students at Small Tree School on Friday.

The number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 87 - 43 (number of girls) = 44."
"To find the number of boys, we need to multiply the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids in the park.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   So, 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   So, 3 * 7 = 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Total number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence over goods on sale is 7 + 21 = 28.
5. Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, 
   the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 28 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. 

Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Then, Erin had 3x points before.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4.67
Erin's points before = 14

So, Erin had 14 points before.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of gift and add them together.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add the costs together: $884 + $10 + $132 = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * 400 = $320

So, the cost of the materials is $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the original cost of the wallpaper. 

Total cost = $320 (materials) + $400 (original cost) = $720

The final answer is: $720"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the amount of Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice, we need to add up the hours she practiced each day.

She practiced 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days is 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, she practiced twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 hours. 
So, the total hours for Saturdays is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's add the hours for all three days: 
3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 4 hours (Saturdays) = 7 hours.

The total hours Hallie had dance practice per week is 7 hours.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x.

Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 40% of x, which is 0.4x.

The total amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on faulty pieces, which is 400000 - 0.4x.

However, we also know that the total amount spent on functioning pieces is 60% of the total amount spent, since 40% were faulty. So, we can set up the equation:

0.6 * 400000 = 400000 - 0.4x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240000 = 400000 - 0.4x

Subtracting 400000 from both sides, we get:

-160000 = -0.4x

Dividing both sides by -0.4, we get:

x = 400000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400000, we can find the number of faulty pieces:

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4x = 0.4 * 400000 = 160000

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 400000 - 160000 = 240000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is 60% of the total amount spent:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6 * 400000 = 240000

The final answer is: 240000"

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, so she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks to find out how many she has missed.

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to find the total interest. The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The final answer is: $1,105"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Axel's silver: 50
Anna's silver: 100
Total silver: 50 + 100 = 150

Axel's gold: 80
Anna's gold: 120
Total gold: 80 + 120 = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350."
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total amount of money she makes from selling lemonade is:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Since she spends $18 on supplies, her total profit is:
$36 - $18 = $18

To find the profit per hour, we need to know how many hours she runs the lemonade stand. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we can divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour to find the total hours:
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we can find the profit per hour:
$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 girls + 26 boys = 52.

Half of the people can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

1/3 * 66 = 22

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Now, we add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

66 + 22 = 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, this means David actually spends more money by buying the ride bracelet."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but since he's bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so he saves $2 on each of the two services. 
The total savings on the two services is $2 + $2 = $4.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $4 (discounted Hulu and Disney Plus) = $14.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 - $14 = $46.

So, Tim saves $46 by cancelling his cable subscription and getting streaming services."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 1.5 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100:

Initially, Erica had 20 cards.
Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each with 15 cards. So, she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.
Now, Erica has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
Now, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.
Now, Erica has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny has left, we need to first calculate how many slices she gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
Then, she gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices. 

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left. 

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to divide the cost of the bike ($300) by the amount he earns per day ($10).

$300 ÷ $10 = 30

So, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, let's add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find the total calories John consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses he drank by the number of ounces in each glass and then multiply that by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Number of ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total ounces = 2 * 8 = 16
Total calories = 16 * 3 = 48

John consumed 48 calories."
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year.

He works 4 weeks a month, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 52 = 208 weeks.

He works 6 days a week, so the total number of days he works in a year is 208 * 6 = 1248 days.

He gets paid $50 every day, so the total amount he earns in a year is 1248 * 50 = $62,400.

The final answer is: $62,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4 since he's making a quadruple batch. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total energy used in a day is 900 watts * 24 hours = 21600 watt-hours (or 21.6 kilowatt-hours).

In 30 days, the total energy used is 21.6 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 648 kilowatt-hours.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage is 900 watts * 19 hours = 17100 watt-hours (or 17.1 kilowatt-hours).

The new total energy used in 30 days is 17.1 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 510 kilowatt-hours.

The energy saved is the difference between the original energy usage and the new energy usage: 648 kilowatt-hours - 510 kilowatt-hours = 138 kilowatt-hours.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's add up the stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 x 17 = 34
- One zebra with 36 stripes: 34 + 36 = 70
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes of the first one: 17 / 2 = 8.5
- Total stripes: 70 + 8.5 = 78.5

Now, let's divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 
78.5 / 3 = 26.17

The average number of stripes is 26.17."
"To find out how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make, we need to divide the total number of people (20) by the number of people each sandwich serves (4). 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 2 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $14.00
The cost of the cheese is 2 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $6.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $14.00 + $6.00 = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns initially. He bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

He also bought 40 fewer corns, so he has 0 - 40 = -40 corns. However, since we can't have a negative number of corns, we can assume that Allan didn't buy any corns. 

So, the total number of cannolis is 100, and the total number of corns is 0. The combined total is 100 + 0 = 100."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps he completed before his jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, we need to subtract this from the time it takes to finish the book to find out how many minutes early Toby will be.

Time to finish the book - Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes - 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
Total amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees left. 
3/4 of 40 employees = 30 employees
Total amount paid in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. She bought 2 pounds, but the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, she paid for 2 pounds at $3 each, which is 2 x $3 = $6.

She also bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The mixed bag of seashells cost $1.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $6 (taffy) + $1 (magnets) + $1.50 (seashells) = $8.50.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $8.50 = $1.50.

Sally has $1.50 left."
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 
$1200 x 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. 
$960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days.

Since she eats 2 cookies per night, for 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 ÷ 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05.

50000 * 0.05 = 2500 candles

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem doesn't provide information about the probability of a candle exploding. We can only assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, as the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect.

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of candles that smell like wet dog, which is 2500.

Final answer: 2500"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
30% of $20 is 0.3 x $20 = $6.

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since they have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. 

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation based on the number of heads:

2c + d = 180 (since each camel and dromedary contributes to the total number of heads)

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have 2 bumps and dromedaries have 1 bump, we can set up another equation:

2c + d = 304

However, we can simplify the problem by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + d) - (2c + d) = 304 - 180
0 = 124

This doesn't make sense, as we can't have 0 on the left side of the equation. This means our initial assumption that the two equations are the same is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

Since camels have 2 bumps and dromedaries have 1 bump, we can set up the correct equations:

2c + d = 180 (heads)
2c + d = 304 (bumps)

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2c + d) - (2c + d) = 304 - 180
0 = 124

This still doesn't make sense. Let's try again.

Since camels have 2 bumps and dromedaries have 1 bump, we can set up the correct equations:

2c + d = 180 (heads)
2c + d = 304 (bumps)

However, we can see that the number of bumps is actually 2 times the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries. So, we can set up the correct equation:

2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve for 'c' in terms of 'd':

2c = 304 - d
c = (304 - d) / 2

Substituting this expression for 'c' into the first equation, we get:

2((304 - d) / 2) + d = 180
304 - d + d = 180
304 = 180

This is still not correct. Let's try again.

Substituting this expression for 'c' into the first equation, we get:

2((304 - d) / 2) + d = 180
304 - d + d = 180

This is still not correct. Let's try again.

Since camels have 2 bumps and dromedaries have 1 bump, we can set up the correct equations:

2c + d = 180 (heads)
2c + d = 304 (bumps)

However, we can see that the number of bumps is actually 2 times the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries. So, we can set up the correct equation:

2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve for 'c' in terms of 'd':

2c = 304 - d
c = (304 - d) / 2

Substituting this expression for 'c' into the first equation, we get:

2((304 - d) / 2) + d = 180
304 - d + d = 180

This is still not correct. Let's try again.

Since camels have 2 bumps and dromedaries have 1 bump, we can set up the correct equations:

2c + d = 180 (heads)

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size.

Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

Final answer: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 20 months.

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The last 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

Now, let's add the costs together: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total amount Cole saved. We know he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, we know that the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4 from them. To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we need to add the amount he saved to the price he paid. $28 + $4 = $32.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $32 + $6 = $38.

To find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the price of the tattered jeans from the price of the jogger jeans. $38 - $28 = $10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds from the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds from the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so we need to calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.
25% of $4 is 0.25 * $4 = $1.
The cost of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first find out how much money he has from selling the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the money he has from selling the cards is the remaining 2/3 of the total amount. 

Let's say the total amount of money he has from selling the cards is x. Then, 2/3 of x is $50. 

We can set up the equation: 
(2/3)x = 50

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny has $75 from selling the cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can divide $75 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold:
75 / 1.5 = 50

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the total number of cards he started with is 3 times the number of cards he sold:
50 * 3 = 150

The final answer is 150."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many guests were initially told to have two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were told to have two hotdogs, we can calculate that as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests

These 18 guests were initially told to have two hotdogs. However, since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, we can assume that all 40 guests got a second hotdog.

Since the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs for the guests who were initially told to have two hotdogs, and 40 guests got a second hotdog, the caterer must have prepared 40 hotdogs in total.

Since the caterer prepared 40 hotdogs and there are 40 guests, we can assume that each guest got one hotdog. 

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 0.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it's 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost.
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132."
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: 
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

The final answer is 1."

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 
   Three quarters of 100 is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
   Twice 75 is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
   One-fifth of 150 is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons = 15 * 1/4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equal to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

Now, we know that 1% of 500 is 5 cents, so we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars. We subtract the 5 cents he had left from the 380 cents he had after buying chips:

380 - 5 = 375 cents

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide 375 by 75 to find out how many candy bars George bought:

375 ÷ 75 = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom ate from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces eaten = 2

Weight of the pieces eaten = 2 * 1 piece = 2 ounces (since each piece weighs 1 ounce)

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the pieces eaten
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 2 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. 

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can multiply the length by 3.

Length in feet = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 1 * 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 * 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike. So, James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We also know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting James' swim time and bike time from James' total time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can multiply the distance by the cost of hay per mile:

Total cost of hay = Distance * Cost per mile
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $3/mile
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find the change, we subtract the total cost of hay from the total money:
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money he made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from those sales.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31.

He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 * $25 = $775 from those sales.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the total cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

Now, let's add the colors together: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the regular price of popcorn is x.

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $12 + x + $3 = $15 + x.

The total cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the difference in cost is $21 - ($15 + x) = $6 - x.

We know that you saved $2, so we can set up the equation: $6 - x = $2.

Solving for x, we get x = $4.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. 
So, the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase. 
The cost of filling 170 balloons is $65 * 170 = $11,100.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
Number of bags needed = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags needed = 320 / 2
Number of bags needed = 160

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost will be:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We also know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
   Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. 
   So, 25 fairies join the initial 50 fairies, making a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   To find the remaining fairies, subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35%"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Frederick has 10 plants.
2. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 
   To find the number of plants Toni has, we need to calculate 60% of 10 and add it to 10.
   60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6
   Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.
3. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.
   To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has.
   Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. 
6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box.
5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

In total, Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students. 
So, the number of cards given to the students is 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student got 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to the students by 10.
300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
Total cost = 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, 
Total cost in dollars = 900 cents / 100 = 9 dollars
Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
Total cost = 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, 
Total cost in dollars = 1000 cents / 100 = 10 dollars
Kelly received a 10 percent discount. 
Discount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar
Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost. 
Difference = Kelly's cost - Becky's cost = 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items per room by 80:
15 items per room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

The final answer is: 1200"

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to first find the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot. 

The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we divide the length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiply by 100.

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we need to first find the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can set up an equation.

Let's say the total number of students is x. Then, the number of students with desktop computers is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without desktop computers is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

Since 20 students do not have desktop computers, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

300 ÷ 15 = 20

So, Sarah bought 20 books. Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide 20 by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Therefore, each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both (to avoid double counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, let's subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to feed his horses. He wants to feed them for 5 days.

Total amount of oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.

Number of bags needed = 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost of 2 packs of razors, first, we need to calculate the total cost without the coupon. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and there's a buy one get one free deal, Heather will pay for 2 packs. 

2 packs * $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Since the deal is buy one get one free, she will pay for 2 packs, but get 1 pack free. So, the total cost is $8.00.

Now, we need to subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. 

$8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert the dollars to cents. 

$6.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 600 cents

Since Heather is buying 2 packs, we need to divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each individual razor.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects they found together is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first find out how much money Suzie spent on the grape and green apple gum. 

She bought 2 packs of grape gum and 1 pack of green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2 per pack, so 2 packs will be 2 x $2 = $4. The green apple gum cost half as much, so it's $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $4 + $1 = $5. 

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $5 = $2. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, each pack costs $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 wood:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 wood to get the most popsicle sticks.

Number of 2 x 8 wood he can buy = $24 / $6
Number of 2 x 8 wood = 4

Total sticks from 4 x 2 x 8 wood = 4 x 400 sticks
Total sticks = 1600 sticks

The most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes. 

Number of dogs: 6
Cost per pair of snowshoes: $12.00

Total cost = Number of dogs * Cost per pair of snowshoes
Total cost = 6 * $12.00
Total cost = $72.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. 
So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. 
So, Sophia bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions and 4 / 4 = 1 potatoes.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potatoes.

3 + 1 = 4"

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns:
30 * 7 = $210

He spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned:
210 - 100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out how many kilometers she will run in total. 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we multiply the total kilometers by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost of the lot. 

$120,000 / 4 = $30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3.

$30,000 * 3 = $90,000

The house costs $90,000."

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Suzanne made 36 cookies.
2. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. 
   To find Josh's cookies, we multiply Suzanne's cookies by 1/4.
   Josh's cookies = 36 * 1/4 = 9 cookies
3. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh.
   To find Kelsie's cookies, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.
   Kelsie's cookies = 9 * 2 = 18 cookies

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48. 
The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To find out how long it takes Royce, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert it to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. 

Adding 40 minutes to that, we get 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

"To find the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the triplets and multiply it by the number of skeins required for each item.

There are 3 grandchildren, and each needs 5 items (hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks). So, the total number of items is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed:
- Hat: 15 x 2 = 30
- Scarf: 15 x 4 = 60
- Sweater: 15 x 12 = 180
- Mittens: 15 x 1 = 15

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, then add the number of loaves returned.

First, subtract the number of loaves sold: 
200 (total loaves) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) = 68

Then, add the number of loaves returned: 
68 + 6 = 74

So, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the smallest number of rows, which is 3 rows.

The total number of rows Jackson will plant is 3.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies = 3/4 cup

Number of batches of oatmeal cookies = Total raisins / Raisins per batch
= 27 / (3/4)
= 27 * (4/3)
= 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her current and future weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours per week
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week

Future weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
Future weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week
Future weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since half a house takes 5 days).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10/5 days, which is 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has by adding 2 to the number of sofas she has. 

20 (sofas) + 2 = 22 (chairs)

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3.

22 (Ophelia's chairs) * 3 = 66 (Jenna's chairs)

Now, we can find the total number of chairs by adding Ophelia's and Jenna's chairs.

22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88 (total chairs)

The total number of sofas is given as 20. To find the total number of furniture, we add the number of sofas and chairs.

20 (sofas) + 88 (chairs) = 108

The final answer is: 108"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought.

Number of CDs = $44 / $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours and the weeks he worked 5 hours, and then add the hours for the week he worked 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked 4 hours, there were 6 weeks. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked 5 hours, there was 1 week. 
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked 6 hours, there was 1 week. 
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, let's add the hours for all the weeks: 
24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off, so the number of people left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off, so the number of people left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of people who got off (21) get on. So, 1/3 * 21 = 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 years old, which is x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 years old, which is 5 + 8 = 13 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 13 - 5 = 8 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors.

Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2.

Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 20 kids in total, the boys brought 20 * 60 = 1200 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 1200 + 4 * 60 = 1200 + 240 = 1440 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, we can divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

1440 / 10 = 144.

The final answer is: 144."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make.

Total vlogs she wants to make: 72
Vlogs she has already made: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total: 
72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we multiply x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 
Distance to work is 3 miles, so the total distance he walks each day is 3 * 2 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

3. She re-writes everything she has already written: 52 letters (from step 1) + 13 letters (from step 2) = 65 letters

Total number of letters written by Elise: 65"
"To find the total number of families notified, we need to calculate the number of families notified in each round and add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:
3 (first round) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120

Therefore, 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can find Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we have the number of goals scored by each teenager:
- Richie: 80
- Mark: 60
- Anna: 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * 4 = $84

Now, let's compare this to what Liam made. Liam made $63.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

Difference = Total amount Mitchell made - Total amount Liam made
= $84 - $63
= $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day. Since there are 4 days, he spent 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day. Since there are 3 days, he spent 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his initial $70. 
$70 - $20 = $50
$50 - $6 = $44

Since he spent $44, he has $44 left. Now, we need to find out how many action figures he can buy with $44.

For wooden action figures, he can buy $44 / $5 = 8.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of an action figure, he can buy 8 wooden action figures.

For plastic action figures, he can buy $44 / $2 = 22.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures.

Total action figures = 8 + 22 = 30"
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to get the yearly amount:
$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Since there are 2 years, we multiply the yearly amount by 2:
$1200/year * 2 years = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The answer is 600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Number of loaves * Cost of bread per loaf
Cost of bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room and then add the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: 10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Let's add up the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. This value is divided by 5: 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the movies, we need to add the length of the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. 
2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, so 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both movies: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
$100.00 * 10% = $10.00
So, the price of 1 box after the discount is:
$100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box has 90 pairs, 2 boxes will have:
90 * 2 = 180 pairs

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 times 100 ml of water, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
His typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
His typing speed increased by 5 words, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add the three numbers together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of Jared's typing speed is 52 WPM.

"To find out how many seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

Initially, Alex invited 100 people. Each of them invited 2 friends, so the number of additional people invited is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the number of additional people invited from her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by the initial invitees, and the 18 additional people invited by Alex's friends. 

Total number of people = 100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Alex needs 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

1. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.
2. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
3. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it is taller than Mark's window.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window (20 feet).
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can divide 200 grams by 3 grams to find the daily protein intake.

200 grams / 3 grams = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake.

66.67 grams/day * 7 days = 466.69 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 467"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced."

The discount is 30% of the total price of the items. The total price of the items is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60. 

30% of $60 is 0.3 x $60 = $18. 

The discounted price of the outfit is $60 - $18 = $42. 

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the discounted price. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Let's assume a 8% sales tax for this example. 

8% of $42 is 0.08 x $42 = $3.36. 

The total cost of the outfit is $42 + $3.36 = $45.36. 

Joe started with $50, so he will have $50 - $45.36 = $4.64 left after the purchase."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed for each dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat. 

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Since each member posts 3 posts per day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day and then by the number of days in March.

Total posts = 1000 members * 3 posts/member * 31 days
Total posts = 93,000 posts

The total number of posts in the group in March will be 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 loads of laundry per week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so he uses 2 * 20 = 40 gallons of water per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of water used in a year. A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. 
So, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg / 150kg = 5 days.

"To find the total number of seats, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = Total seats - seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second.

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second.

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour.

Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/second x 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. 
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed.
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's subtract his current height from the required height:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cars: 
   Total cost = Number of cars * Price per car
   Total cost = 10 * $25,000
   Total cost = $250,000

2. Calculate the amount the company paid for the cars:
   Company's payment = 30% of the total cost
   Company's payment = 0.3 * $250,000
   Company's payment = $75,000

3. Calculate the profit:
   Profit = Total cost - Company's payment
   Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
   Profit = $175,000

4. Calculate James' commission:
   James' commission = 10% of the profit
   James' commission = 0.1 * $175,000
   James' commission = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25 (100% - 60% = 40%). 
0.4 * 25 = 10.

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. 

Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 - 55
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed

Distance = 75 miles (the distance between Bob and Tom)
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find out how many classes he can afford with $10 per class.

$10 per class * 10 classes = $100

Since Manny has already paid $60, he can afford 40 more classes at $10 per class. 

However, the question asks how many classes he can miss before his parents won't sign him up again. 

If he misses 10 classes, the total cost will be $100. 

So, Manny can miss 10 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Since the final price paid on Tuesday ($398) is higher than the final price paid on Wednesday ($540), the difference is negative."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month.

In the first month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half of the total sales from green hats. So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is 2 x $400 = $800.

Total sales in the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
3/4 of $1200 = (3/4) * $1200 = $900.

Weekly wage: $300
Amount in bank account: $420

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens.

Total eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12

Total dozens needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days left = 30 - 20
= 10

So, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 x $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 x $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 x $10,000 = $120,000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, the cooking time for beans is 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information about the total number of animal legs and heads.

Let's assume the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

Since each sheep and goose has one head, the total number of heads is:
s + g = 20

We can solve these two equations to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' the same in both equations:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation:
(2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70
This simplifies to:
-2s = -30
Dividing both sides by -2 gives us:
s = 15

Now that we know the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting 's' into one of the original equations:
s + g = 20
15 + g = 20
g = 5

So, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 days. He uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the coffee: 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:
- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
- Bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- Bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of other items) = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to find 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers. 

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
3/4 * 120 = 90

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
90 + 60 = 150

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 
120 + 90 + 150 = 360

To find out how much each person would have if they share equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 
360 / 3 = 120

So, each person would have $120."
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees.

First, we find 20% of the total employees: 
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Then, we find 30% of the result:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find out how much candy they have in total, we need to add the amount of candy each person had. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 
3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount of candy by 3, since they are sharing it equally among themselves.

12 / 3 = 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

$15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first find the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

- Good days: 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 11
- Bad days: 8 (second 8 days)
- Neutral days: 8 (third 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 11

Now, we know that the total number of days is 30. We can set up an equation to represent this:

11 (good days) + 8 (bad days) + 11 (neutral days) = 30

However, this equation is not correct because it counts the last 3 days twice. We need to subtract the last 3 days from the total number of days to get the correct total number of good, bad, and neutral days.

Let's recalculate the total number of days:
- Good days: 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 11
- Bad days: 8 (second 8 days)
- Neutral days: 8 (third 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) - 3 (last 3 days) = 8

Now, we can set up the correct equation:
11 (good days) + 8 (bad days) + 8 (neutral days) = 27

Since the total number of days is 30, we can subtract 27 from 30 to find the number of good days left:
30 - 27 = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.
4. However, when James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs 24 - 4 = 20 more toys.
6. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 20 - 3 = 17 more toys.

In total, James needs 12 (initially needed) + 20 (additional needed) + 17 (additional needed after 3 dogs left) = 49 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5.

Dylan's investment = 1200 * 2/5 = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.

Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3 to find Frances' investment.

Frances' investment = 720 * 2/3 = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment.

Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was 240.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The 9 people will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up all the cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 
68 + 5 = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
73 - 12 = 61

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
73 + 23 = 96

Now that we know Summer has 96 cookies, we can add up all the cookies:
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The total number of cookies is 298."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress.

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's say the age of the younger twin is 'x'. Since there's a twin who is 7 years older, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'.

The triplet's age is not specified, but we can represent it as 'y'. Since there are three triplets, we can represent the combined age of the triplets as '3y'.

We know that the combined age of all four children is 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 3y = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 37

Now, we need more information to solve for 'x'. However, we can try to find a possible solution by assuming the triplet's age is a multiple of 3. 

Let's try y = 7 (since 7 is a multiple of 3 and it's a reasonable age for a triplet). 

Substitute y = 7 into the equation:

2x + 3(7) = 37
2x + 21 = 37
2x = 16
x = 8

So, the age of the younger twin is 8 years old.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

Since we want to know the total number of coins saved after 10 years, we multiply 240 by 10. 
240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we multiply the number of coins Neil saves per month by the number of months in a year. 
28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since we want to know the total number of coins saved after 10 years, we multiply 336 by 10. 
336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check together is 100% of the total bill. 
So, 0.6x + 40 = x

Now, let's solve for x.

So, Mia has 40 regular chairs. Now, we need to add the number of high chairs to get the total number of chairs.

40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to add them to the total number of chairs.

42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city display and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 12 friends initially, and 7 more friends join them, making a total of 12 + 7 = 19 people.

Each person has 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so the total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks.
The total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The total amount of gravel that Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. When Gary joins them, the total amount of gravel they can carry is 11,600 pounds.
5. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the amount that Gissela and Gordy can carry from the total amount: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he initially got. 

Since the total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5, and Gerald got 3 parts, we can divide 100 by 5 to find out how much money he got per part. 

100 / 5 = 20

Gerald got 3 parts, so he initially had 3 x 20 = 60 dollars.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 dollars left.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, we find 80% of 40%:
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32

Now, we subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

So, the city uses 68% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: 68"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 10% (or 0.10): $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, Erin can buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. 

To find out how many scoops she should buy, we can calculate the total number of scoops she can get with 4 scoops.

4 scoops - 2 scoops (free) = 2 scoops

So, Erin should buy 2 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day. In two weeks, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's candy from Amy's candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles for every square foot, we multiply 24 by 24. 

24 * 24 = 576 

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom.

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends from the total number of slices. 60 - 80 = -20. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, we need to recalculate the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends.

Let's recalculate the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can find the number of slices they ate by multiplying 2/3 by 12: (2/3) x 12 = 8 slices. 

Now, we subtract the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 8 = 52 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we subtract the slices eaten by the two remaining friends from the remaining slices: 52 - 18 = 34 slices.

"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time the cat takes. 

The cat takes 30 minutes, so 2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

The dog takes 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages. 

The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. To find the average, we add the two times and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Now, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Initially, there were 12 birds. After 4 were scared away, there were 12 - 4 = 8 birds left.

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Now, the total number of birds is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first find the total number of students in each class. 

Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2 to get the number of students in each class. 

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mara started with 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. She added 3 more slices, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. She tripled the number of slices she currently has, so she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
4. She ate 2 slices, so now she has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so now she has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals and divide it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Total number of animals = 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses
Total number of animals = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost of the first amusement park, we need to multiply the number of adults by the adult fee and the number of children by the child fee, then add the two amounts together.

For the first amusement park: 
Adults: 2 * $26 = $52
Children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
Adults: 2 * $14 = $28
Children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:
$76 - $48 = $28

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50 per day

To find out how much he saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:
$50 per day * 7 days = $350 per week

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4. 
Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups already required (12). 

However, the question states that 12 groups are required, but the activity needs 54 students. This means the 12 groups are not enough to accommodate all the students. 

Since 54 divided by 12 is 4.5, we can't have a fraction of a group. We need to find the closest whole number of groups that can accommodate 54 students. 

54 divided by 12 is 4.5, so we need 5 groups to accommodate 54 students. 

Since we already have 12 groups, we need 5 - 12 = -3 more groups. However, this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of groups. 

The question seems to be incorrect or misleading. If 12 groups are required, we can't form more groups."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 days.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 days.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = chairs rented during weekdays + chairs rented during weekends
Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so we need to divide 48 by 2: 48 / 2 = 24 bananas stolen by Arnold.
   Now, Gunther has 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
3. Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so now he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile, so we need to subtract 12 from 49: 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.
5. Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, so now he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month and then multiply it by 12.

The electricity bill is $100 per month. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the bill by 4 to find out the share of each roommate per month.

$100 ÷ 4 = $25 per roommate per month

Now, we multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly share.

$25 per month × 12 months = $300 per year

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches he played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
He played 1 match on Friday.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, so he played 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation ""x"". 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of votes is 33. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying it by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to first find out how many people think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find out how many people are remaining after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 or horse #7 will win. 
The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 34 = 16 people.

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up an equation for the total number of puppies:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges he needs for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms will cost 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Now, we need to add the additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes. Since Tanya teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the extra $5.

Total earnings for Monday: $300 + $5 = $305

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 ÷ 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Find the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Find the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 3: Find the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 4: Find the cost of the movies in series.
Since the cost of the series is $6 less than the cost of a normal movie, the cost of the series is:
Cost of series = Cost of a normal movie - $6
= $10 - $6
= $4

Step 5: Find the cost of the older movies.
The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost is:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Step 6: Find the cost of the normal movies.
The cost of the normal movies is the remaining movies minus the number of older movies, multiplied by the cost of a normal movie:
Cost of normal movies = (Remaining movies - Number of older movies) * Cost of a normal movie
= (400 - 160) * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Step 7: Find the total cost of replacing the movies.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:
Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $4 + $800 + $2400
= $3204

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so Ava jumps on 8 + 8 = 16 enemies. Emma jumps on 16 - 8 = 8 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. 

Emma's score is 8 * 10 + 15 + (60 - 4) = 80 + 15 + 56 = 151 points.
Ava's score is 16 * 10 + 12 + (60 + 4) = 160 + 12 + 64 = 236 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). We will assume that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange, but some were orange and some were white.

Let's say the number of orange fish taken out is x. Then the number of white fish taken out is 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) = 4 - 17 + x = -13 + x white fish.

We are told that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(-13 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = -26 + 2x

Adding x to both sides, we get:

3 = -26 + 3x

Adding 26 to both sides, we get:

29 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 29/3

x is not a whole number, but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can solve the equation exactly.

x = 29/3 is not a whole number, but we can solve the equation exactly.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, he travels 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the amount of gas he uses per week by dividing the total distance by his fuel efficiency:

25 miles / 10 MPG = 2.5 gallons

Now, we can multiply the amount of gas used by the current price of gas to find the total cost:

2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.50

So, Andy's car is consuming $7.50 per week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

She spent 6 twenties, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 twenties left.

Carrie had 140 quarters. She spent all of them, so she has 0 quarters left.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent. 
She spent 6 twenties, which is 6 * 20 = 120 dollars.
She also spent 140 quarters, which is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, Carson needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to the desired temperature."

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to add their scores together to find the total. 
Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 
There are 40 classes with 25 students per class. 
Total number of students = 40 * 25 = 1000 students.

Number of teachers: 
There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class. 
Total number of teachers = 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Number of trees planted by students: 
Each student plants 1 tree. 
Total number of trees planted by students = 1000 * 1 = 1000 trees.

Number of trees planted by teachers: 
Each teacher plants 2 trees. 
Total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240 trees.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. To do this, we multiply 14 by 0.3 (since 30% is equal to 0.3):

14 * 0.3 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy 0.2 of a stuffed animal, so we will round down to 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she played 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the diamond and the gold separately, then add them together and add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.

Total cost of the diamond and gold = $600 + $300 = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per square inch and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount.
Initial amount = 10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount to gallons by dividing by 4.
Initial amount in gallons = 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first find out how many candies he has in total. 

Dale started with 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, he sold 150 candies, so he now has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

The answer is 50."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 15 - 1 = 14 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 24 - 1 = 23 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 20 - 1 = 19 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 42 - 1 = 41 petals

Now, let's add the remaining petals together: 
14 + 23 + 19 + 41 = 97 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 97."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used: 
John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows: 
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used marshmallows) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 
17 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 8.5 S'mores.

Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores for each kid.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jack played for 4/60 = 1/15 hours.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half as long, so they played for 20/2 = 10 minutes, or 1/6 hours.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so they played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes, or 1/2 hour.

Now, let's add up the total time played by all three friends: 
1/15 + 1/6 + 1/2 = (4 + 5 + 15) / 30 = 24/30 = 4/5 hours.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, or $0.25, the total cost is 4/5 * $0.25 = $0.20.

The final answer is: $0.20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar used is also x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

We also know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. Let's call the amount of citrus zest and fragrance y ounces.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

x (salt) + x (sugar) + 2x (oil) + y (citrus zest) + y (fragrance) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x + 2y = 10

We know that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, so we can substitute x for y:

4x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 10/6
x = 5/3

Now that we know the amount of salt, we can find the amount of oil. Since the amount of oil is 2x, we multiply 2 by 5/3:

2 * 5/3 = 10/3

So, Tanya uses 10/3 ounces of oil.

10/3"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500.

John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% is equal to 0.2). 
   40 * 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. We subtract the cars he sold and gave away from his total.
   40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations ($50,000) from the total amount raised ($175,000).

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the remaining amount by 20 to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked for half of the time she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Total time = 480 + 240 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had gone. To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35.
4. So, 35 cars left, leaving 70 - 35 = 35 cars in the parking lot.
5. Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 x $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, the total amount he earns per day is 30 x $6 = $180.

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find the weekly earnings: $180 x 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins.

88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say PJ has x cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and then subtract the refund amount from the original purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
Weight: 4 pounds
Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles
Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Total shipping cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Original purchase price: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan started with $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, it means she is in debt."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
Production for the fourth week = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends on each activity: 72 videos (recording) + 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. 
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items. 
The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, so we need to find 40% of $30.00. 
   40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00
4. Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's amount to find Roy's amount.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and finally how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of one turtle is:

Speed of one turtle = Speed of one kangaroo / 2
Speed of one turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of one turtle = 3 hours

Since there are four turtles, the total time it will take for them to travel across the highway is:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
We don't know the total distance, but we can use the fact that 3 kangaroos can travel it in 18 hours. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can use the speed of the kangaroo to find the distance:

Distance = Speed of one kangaroo * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now we can find the total time it will take for the four turtles to travel across the highway:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
Total time = 108 hours / 3 turtles
Total time = 36 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4:

Total time = 36 hours * 4
Total time = 144 hours

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she also received $150 for her part-time job. Her mom agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 (since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop).

Now, let's solve for x:
x + 230 = 350
x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day.

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we can divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find out how many liters one cow produces per day.

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow to find out the number of cows needed.

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs.

15 cows - 3 cows = 12 cows

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and then add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of each glue stick that is not used:
- The first glue stick has 5/6 used, so it has (1 - 5/6) = 1/6 left. 
- The second glue stick has 1/3 used, so it has (1 - 1/3) = 2/3 left.
- The third glue stick has 1/2 used, so it has (1 - 1/2) = 1/2 left.

Now, let's convert the fractions to decimals to make it easier to calculate:
- The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is approximately 0.17 mm.
- The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is approximately 0.67 mm.
- The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 0.5 mm.

Now, let's add the lengths together:
0.17 + 0.67 + 0.5 = 1.34 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 1.34 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 
Total amount Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

The total cost of the items he wants to buy = $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Now, let's subtract the total amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600.

Final answer: 5600"
"To find the change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills. 

Four $20 bills equal 4 * $20 = $80.

The hat costs $70, so we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she paid: $80 - $70 = $10.

Thea got $10 in change."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so that's 6 x $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so that's 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 60 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks, we add 60 + 60.

60 + 60 = 120

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is 3/4 * $525 = $393.75, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $393.75 = $918.75.

For the third year, the interest earned is 3/4 * $918.75 = $693.5625, so the total amount after 3 years is $918.75 + $693.5625 = $1612.3125.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is approximately $1612.31.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs bought in a year.

Total amount spent on shoes in a year = $2640
Number of pairs bought in a year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent on shoes in a year / Number of pairs bought in a year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 x $3) = $48.

The total cost will be $75 + $48 = $123.

Final answer: $123"
"To find the total time it takes to clean half of the rooms, we need to first find the total time it takes to clean all the rooms. 

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. 
Total time = 90 * 20 minutes
Total time = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2.
Time to clean half the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean half the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.
Time to clean half the rooms = 900 / 60
Time to clean half the rooms = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Then, my brother's age is x + 3, and my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of our ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs: 
27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in a pack:
54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs to have enough glue sticks for all the students. This will also give him some extra glue sticks, as 7 packs * 8 glue sticks/pack = 56 glue sticks, which is more than the 54 glue sticks needed."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

Therefore, after three days, 490 people are infected.

490"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips.

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so she received $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of tips received by both, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 x 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns 1 / 2 = 0.5 badges per month. In a year, she earns 0.5 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 * 1 = 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she baked. 

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. 

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. 

To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Then, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

So, there were 480 burritos leftover from the picnic.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find out how much the sweet potatoes weighed. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, that means Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan pays in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
Tobias ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36 pieces remaining.

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26 pieces remaining.

On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.
26 - 14 = 12 pieces remaining.

So, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda: 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.

The total cost of 2 bottles of water: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

She earned $33 for 3 hours, so her hourly rate is $33 / 3 = $11 per hour.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias will sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5 = 900 / 5 = 180 chickens.

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = 9000 dollars.

Isaias needs to make $2000 to break even. To find out how much he spent on the chickens, we subtract the amount he needs to make from the amount he will make:

9000 - 2000 = 7000 dollars.

So, Isaias spent $7000 on the chickens he took to the market for sale.

The final answer is: 7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 10.67 (Micah's glasses) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

40 - 30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find out how many microphones were able to fit in the stage. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means 80% of the microphones can fit in the stage. 

Number of microphones that can fit in the stage = 80% of 50
= 0.8 * 50

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5

Cookies left = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 55 - 5
Cookies left = 50

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = Cookies left / 5
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to first find out the total number of petals of each.

The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals of the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals of the daisies is 10 * 4 = 40.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies. 

40 (daisies) - 25 (orchids) = 15

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100. 
One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the thingamabob first. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x meters per second. 
Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x meters per second. 
We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation: 
11x = 121 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 
So, the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second. 

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. 
Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5: 
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11 
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first find out the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we divide the cost of the carrots by 2 (since she eats 2 carrots a day). 

$2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, we can set up the equation: 6x = total amount from mowing lawns.

We know that she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, so the total amount from mowing lawns is 6x + 15x = 21x.

Now we can set up the equation: 6x = 21x. However, this is not possible, as it would mean that the amount she earned from mowing lawns is infinite.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total amount from mowing lawns is 6x. We also know that she made $80 in total. Since she made $80 from both lemonade and mowing lawns, we can set up the equation: 6x + 80 = 80.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it would mean that she made $0 from mowing lawns.

Let's try again. We know that she made $80 in total, and she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. We can subtract $6 from $80 to find out how much she made from lemonade: 80 - 6 = 74.

Now we know that she made $74 from lemonade. We can set up the equation: 6x + 74 = 80.

Now we can solve for x: 6x = 80 - 74, 6x = 6, x = 1.

So, she mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now we know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, $18 from mowing Kamala's lawn (3x = 3 * 6 = 18), and $30 from mowing Alba's lawn (5x = 5 * 6 = 30).

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many notebooks Joseph had.

7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't have a fraction of a notebook)

Now, we know Joseph had 2 notebooks. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

12 - 2 = 10

Joseph has 10 fewer notebooks than Martha."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis' distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 + 1/5. 

1 + 1/5 = 6/5

Now, multiply Dijana's distance by 6/5:
50 * 6/5 = 60 miles

So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."

"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 
Daniel didn't read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel. 
Denise read 18 pages today and Daniel read 0 pages today. 
So, Denise read 18 - 0 = 18 pages more than Daniel.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many bowls of soup Calvin has, we need to know how many bowls he has in total. Since he can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say he has 4 * 2 = 8 bowls of soup.

There are 3 people eating (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children), so 3 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls of soup are left. 8 (total bowls) - 3 (eaten bowls) = 5 bowls of soup left.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the leftover soup by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 5 / 2 = 2.5. Since you can't have half a bowl, we round down to 2."

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 / 4 = 5 times the material. 
So, for 20 small masks, she would need 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material. 
So, for 8 large masks, she would need 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material.

In total, Jo would need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets per movie = 27 tickets

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, let's subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes.

Number of blue shoe boxes left = Total blue shoe boxes - Blue shoe boxes used
= 7 - 3
= 4

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes.

Number of red shoe boxes used = 1/3 * Total red shoe boxes
= 1/3 * 9
= 3

Number of red shoe boxes left = Total red shoe boxes - Red shoe boxes used
= 9 - 3
= 6

So, the total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 4 blue + 6 red = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had before he lost any. 

Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

Then, Joseph lost 2 books. So, he now has 18 - 2 = 16 books.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away.

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie. 
1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6 marbles.

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald.

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total marbles he had initially.
30 - 16 = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'A' and Duncan's current age as 'D'. We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

2. We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

3. Now, substitute D = 60 into the equation:
   60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
   52 = 2A - 8

4. Add 8 to both sides of the equation:
   52 + 8 = 2A
   60 = 2A

5. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for A:
   A = 60 / 2
   A = 30

6. Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:
   Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we need to add the acres of both farms together. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of both farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons. 

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

Let's say the number of yellow balloons is x. Then, the total number of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 3x. 

We know that the total number of bologna thrown is 58, and 2 pieces were thrown at each red balloon. So, the total number of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 40 = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:
3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. The cost of 2 balloons is $0.5, so the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * 0.5 = $6. 

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can say that the total amount they had initially is also $31.

To find out how much their mother gave each of them, we need to divide the total amount by 2. 

$31 / 2 = $15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

15.50"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

Total number of fruits Kira bought: 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 fruits

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total cost of lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost of lollipops = 300 * $0.5
Total cost of lollipops = $150

Total profit = Total number of lollipops sold * Selling price per lollipop - Total cost of lollipops
Total profit = 300 * $0.8 - $150
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices eaten per day (6).

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. 

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and is now 10 years old. 

10 years - 5 years = 5 years

Since she collects one shell per month, we multiply the number of years by 12 (months in a year).

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday. 

60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row. 

27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups per row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and there are 9 cups in each row, she must have 9 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide 24 berries by 2 trips to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:
5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$124 / $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156
Total Junebugs removed on Thursday and Friday = 48 + 57 = 105
Total Junebugs removed in 5 days = 39 + 156 + 105 = 300

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the initial number of balloons each person had and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 balloons. Maria had 1 balloon for herself. So, the total number of balloons initially is 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (9) and the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.
They already own 10 boxes, so 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2

= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the total amount of money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 in 30 days is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

The total amount of money Fern will make from the WidgetMaster 9000 in 30 days is 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the amount of money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay. Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs:
10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150

Since James got 40% off, we need to calculate the discount:
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he got:
5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200

Now, subtract the amount he got back from the total cost:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She was given 15 stickers initially.
2. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. Her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

Commission for the New York Times: 
6 copies * $5 * 10% = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Commission for the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * $15 * 8% = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission: 
$3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we need to know Deanna's age and the relationship between Marcus and Leo. 

We know Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

We also know Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, Leo's age is 2 times Marcus's age. 
Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up an equation. Let's say Dinar scored x points. Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points, and Bahati scored (x + 10) + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points. Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
Azibo scored x + 10 points = 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, we need to find out how long she was asleep in the usual time frame. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total time.

480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep while sleepwalking. She was asleep from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes.

475 minutes + 23 minutes = 498 minutes

The final answer is: 498"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons and received 6 more for his birthday. 

So, the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has now is 16 + 6 = 22 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups. 

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 measuring cups + 22 measuring spoons = 46 utensils.

46"
"To find the total number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 200 beds are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 * 14 = 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:
200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the unoccupied beds:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails sent per day = 16
   Work emails = 7
   Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   Non-work emails = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her boyfriend. 
   Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, so one-third of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * Non-work emails
   Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * 9
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then multiply it by 3. 

Aliya is 3 years old. 
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jeffrey carried half of Jason's amount. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day and then determine how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116.

Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms again:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we need to multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first leg and then a northerly direction for the second leg, and finally a southerly direction for the third leg, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she got from her office party, and the ones her friends brought.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She got 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies from her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies.

Now, let's add them together: 
12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. 
We need to subtract these from the total: 
66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

48"
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

John paid a total of $2100 for the new phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total number of players.

Total number of players = 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total number of slats needed = 50 * 2
Total number of slats needed = 100

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:

Half of 50 states is 50 / 2 = 25 states
India has 4 more than that, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states

Now, we add the number of states in both countries: 
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we subtract this from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25 at $5 per hour. 

To do this, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5): $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation: 
Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. 
Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting 50 from 60:
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday = 15
Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days. 

Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday = 10
Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday = 10 * $6 = $60
Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday = 15 * $6 = $90
Earnings from apple pie on Saturday = 11 * $15 = $165
Earnings from apple pie on Sunday = 15 * $15 = $225

Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.

We can multiply both sides by 2 to get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

We can divide both sides by 2 to get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the total space needed for the plants and the space between them. 

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there's 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. 
So, the total space needed for each plant and the space between is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, let's divide the total space by the space needed for each plant and the space between them:
1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:
27 * 6 = $162

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 9. 
So Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. 
There are 7 days in a week. 
9 pretzels a day * 7 days = 63 pretzels.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can say that she can peel 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 

Now, to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6 (the number of shrimp she can peel per minute). 
90 / 6 = 15 minutes

So, it will take her 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

To find out how long it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to add the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp to the time it takes her to saute 90 shrimp. 
Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can multiply 10 by 3 to get the time it takes her to saute 90 shrimp.
10 * 3 = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp (15 minutes) to the time it takes her to saute 90 shrimp (30 minutes).
15 + 30 = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. So, the room cooled 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. So, the room cooled 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour, so it warmed up 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total change in temperature. The room started at some temperature, then cooled 6 degrees, then warmed up 4 degrees, and finally cooled 6 degrees (since it was turned off for 2 hours). So, the total change in temperature is 6 - 4 + 6 = 8 degrees.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 
2. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can say that Bill's dad was 30 - x years old when he saw the comet.
3. Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   So, Bill's age at the second time is 3 * (30 - x).
4. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years. 
   Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
   x + 75 = 3 * (30 - x)
5. Now, let's solve the equation:
   x + 75 = 90 - 3x
   4x = 15
   x = 15 / 4
   x = 3.75

So, Bill was 3.75 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's add Akbar and Alessandro's ages: 3 + 4 = 7.
4. Since the total age is 20, we subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13.
5. We know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's call the average age 'x'. Then, Helene's age is 2x.
6. The sum of the ages of all four children is 20, so we can write the equation: 3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20.
7. We know the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages is 7, so we can rewrite the equation as: 7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20.
8. Now, we can simplify the equation: 2x + Wilfred's age = 13.
9. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write: 2x = 2 * (average age) = 2 * (20/4) = 10.
10. Solving for x, we get x = 5.
11. Now that we know the average age is 5, we can find Helene's age: 2x = 2 * 5 = 10.
12. Now that we know Helene's age is 10, we can find Wilfred's age: 2x + Wilfred's age = 13, 10 + Wilfred's age = 13, Wilfred's age = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 
Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute to make the total amount a multiple of 3.

Let's assume Walter's lawyer is going to contribute x. Then, the total amount will be $2000 + x.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we can set up the equation:
2000 + x = 3 * (2000 + x)

Simplifying the equation:
2000 + x = 6000 + 3x

Subtracting x from both sides:
2000 = 6000 + 2x

Subtracting 6000 from both sides:
-4000 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:
-2000 = x

Since the amount cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-examine the situation.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we can assume that Walter's lawyer is going to contribute the remaining amount to make the total amount a multiple of 3.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. 
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Half of the cookies were given to the church: 
1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were in the church:
750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6.

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each slice is a unit, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100.

Percentage of watermelon for each adult = (4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $60 = $360.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons. However, the question does not provide the total number of sessions in a month. 

Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions in a month is 10 students * 4 weeks * 3 days per week = 120 sessions.

The total monthly earnings of the dance studio is $25 * 120 = $3000.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $3000 - $360 = $2640.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so we divide 64 by 4 to get 16 chocolate bars per box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7 to get 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box: 16 - 8 = 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 8230 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = 8230 gallons * $0.10 per gallon
Cost = $823

The cost to fill the pool is $823."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue sticks first. 

Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. 

450 - 220 = 230

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. 
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

To find the number of female students over 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16. 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16. 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 years old to find the total number of female students. 
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
34% = 28% + x
x = 6%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 6%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide the total hours by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total money spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. Since he can't spend a negative amount of money, this means he has spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $0.25 left, he can buy 1 plum at $0.25.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

780 / 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means that each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies, we multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies. 

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, we multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits. 

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

27

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to first find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

Since James reads 18 pages, we divide 18 by 3 to get 6 sets of 3 pages. 

6 sets of 3 pages is 6 * 3 = 18 pages.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, it will take him 10 minutes to read 18 pages. 

So, James spends 10 minutes reading.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The hotel initially had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining from the initial check-in) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide 60 by 2 to find the number of each type of question.
60 / 2 = 30

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 30 = 15.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 15 = 33.

The final answer is 33."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

Now, let's say Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals and 'l' large stuffed animals. We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so s = 2l.

We also know that she earned $120 from the sales. The total amount earned from selling small stuffed animals is 4s, and the total amount earned from selling large stuffed animals is 12l. The total amount earned is the sum of these two, which is equal to $120.

So, we can set up the equation: 4s + 12l = 120.

Substituting s = 2l, we get: 4(2l) + 12l = 120
Expanding the equation, we get: 8l + 12l = 120
Combine like terms: 20l = 120
Divide both sides by 20: l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold: s = 2l = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found, so the number of eggs that were found is 100 - 10 = 90.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found from the total number of eggs that were found: 90 - 60 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we multiply the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe by 40 dwarves and 30 days:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

The final answer is 43,200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment. Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate it as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

   Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   Half of the yellow balloons = 1/2 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons released.

   Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6

3. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

   Total balloons now = 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% chance (100% - 40% chance of extension)
   - In this case, Marcus still has to turn in his homework: 100% chance

2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% chance
   - In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 0% chance

3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance
   - In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 100% chance

Now, let's calculate the total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

Probability of normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension: 0.6 * 1 = 0.6
Probability of normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Probability of substitute teacher coming in: 0.5 * 1 = 0.5

Total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework: 0.6 + 0.24 + 0.5 = 1.34

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
1.34 * 100 = 134%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 134%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we can multiply 75 by 2 to find out how many medium beans he can eat.

75 * 2 = 150

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide 150 by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat.

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Daily income: $15 per day
Total daily expenses: $3 per day (parking)
Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours
Total income after expenses: $12 per day * 3 days = $36

"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of times he needs to move by the time it takes to move:

7 times * 5 seconds per time = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes. 

Total apples = 40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 11 * 2 = $22.

Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of mozzarella cheese is 6 * 3 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year, so the total amount of money he lost is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
He had a $25,000 a year job before college, and his college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years, the total amount of money he earned is:
$75,000 * 4 = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school:
$200,000 (lost money) + $50,000 (loans) = $250,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$250,000 / $75,000 = 3.33 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 3.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 3.33"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric separately and then add them together.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.

The area of the first piece of fabric is 8 x 10 = 80 square feet.
The area of the second piece of fabric is 8 x 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to add the areas together: 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he lost 2 * $5 - $1 = $9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
He won $9 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $9 = $13.5.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost: $5 + $9 + $13.5 = $27.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $27.5 / 3 = $9.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $9.17."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26

The total population in South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's say the first person took x dollars.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

"To find the total hours of work, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert 3 weeks to days. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, we multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day worked: 21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 3/8 = 63/8 = 7.875 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours: 7.875 * 24 = 189 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x.

Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set, the number of balls in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of books written in English and German.

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. So, the total becomes 140 + 100 = 240.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total becomes 240 - 80 = 160.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160."
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles needed and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and the floor area is 200 SqFt, we can fit 200 tiles in the floor.

Now, to find the total number of tiles, we need to divide the total area by the area of a single tile. However, since the tiles are square (1ft x 1ft), the area of a single tile is 1 SqFt. 

So, the total number of tiles needed is 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we can multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost.

Total cost = 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * 120 = $72

Now, add the increased cost to the normal cost:
$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this amount for a month, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost:
$192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: 2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
So, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from the previous years: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's slices: 
10 - 3 = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find Silvia's slices: 
7 * 2 = 14

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices together: 
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The visit: The visit is 30 minutes long, so we need to convert it to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300/hour, so the total cost of the visit is 0.5 * $300 = $150.

2. The cast: The cost of the cast is $200.

3. The painkillers: The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

4. The parking: The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the total cost of the parking is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails don't require a response, so we need to find 80% of 80 emails. 

80% of 80 is 0.8 x 80 = 64. 

So, 64 emails don't require a response. 

The rest of the emails that James responds to are 80 - 64 = 16.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

16 x 5 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. 
70% of 20 = 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. 
The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
80% of 40 = 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the pizzas eaten by both groups: 
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.
To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (left) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds of butter he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2. 
6 / 2 = 3

Since he gets one half off for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds. So, for 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter.

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. 
Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 
Number of guests = 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 
Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests. 
Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the total cost. 
Total cost = $125 (for 20 guests) + $6 * 21 (for additional guests) 
Total cost = $125 + $126 
Total cost = $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they initially had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent 1/4 of her money. Let's call the amount of money Maggie had 'x'. Then, the amount she spent is x/4.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent 1/3 of her money. Let's call the amount of money Riza had 'y'. Then, the amount she spent is y/3.

Since they each had $60, we can set up the following equations:

x - x/4 = 60
y - y/3 = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the first equation by 4:
4x - x = 240
3x = 240
x = 80

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides of the second equation by 3:
3y - y = 180
2y = 180
y = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 and Riza had $90, we can find out how much money they have left.

Maggie has 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.
Riza has 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.

They have a total of 60 + 60 = 120 dollars left.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey. 
There are 315 bananas in total. 
The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 
So, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas per day.

However, since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, we need to divide 291 by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day. 
291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

Since we can't have a fraction of a banana, we can round down to 41 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (since 15 is 1.25 times a dozen) = $18.75.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she will need to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. For the remaining 75 cents, we need 3 quarters (since 3 * 25 = 75).

So, Jenny will leave with 52 quarters + 3 quarters = 55 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total and she already has 120, we need to subtract 120 from 200 to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 more toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we need to divide 2000 by 0.75 to get the original price. 

Original price = 2000 / 0.75
Original price = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 

Selling price = 1.2 * 2666.67
Selling price = 3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount = (Original price - Selling price) / Original price * 100
Discount = (2666.67 - 3200) / 2666.67 * 100
Discount = -533.33 / 2666.67 * 100
Discount = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the selling price is higher than the original price, which means there is a loss. The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it will create 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). In 4 hours, it will create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours. Since each spring creates 240 jellyfish in 4 hours, 5 springs will create 5 * 240 jellyfish = 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, we can divide the distance by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked to the store and then back home, we need to double the time:

Total Time = 2 x 1 hour
Total Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

Now, to find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:
100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."

"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which is 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract them from the total to find the number of MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from each type of bike: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 6 classes per day, but he has 2 extra classes, so he attends 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. His weekly minutes are 1600, so he spends 1/16 * 1600 = 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra learning time: 1600 + 100 = 1700 minutes per week.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1700 / 60 = 28.33 hours per week.

The final answer is 28.33."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the ball on its second bounce. The ball will bounce to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find out how many bags were sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the initial amount is 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

The answer is 1080."
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda, we need to calculate the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda if she picks the last shaken soda. 

There are 12 sodas in total, and 1 of them is shaken. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 1/12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/12) * 100 = 8.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to first calculate the total number of days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31.

20% of 31 = 0.2 * 31 = 6.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available by the number of people he can help per day.

25 days * 6 people per day = 150 people

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Number of people in cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Total number of people: 
420 people (in buses) + 60 people (in cars) = 480 people

The church was not mentioned to be empty, so we assume that all the people were inside the church. 

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the information given:

1. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. 
   Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
   Martha's age = 24 - 4
   Martha's age = 20

2. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
   Jeff's age = 20 + 10
   Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes first.

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes per day, and he takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each. 
So, the total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent on lunch and breaks is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 
To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance. 
52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that cost $15.00 was returned, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00. The new price of the frying pan is $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. The new price of the towels is $27.00.

Now, we add the new prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and these are the large jellyfish that change color. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This means that Lauren is actually spending more than she saves, which is not possible. 

However, if we assume that Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

Total amount needed for 20 years = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Since Lauren is spending more than she saves, we can't calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $400,000."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys in the school.

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can divide the number of boys by the decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 600 - 240 = 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate a quarter of 12 kg for Pierre and 1/3 of 12 kg for Paul.

A quarter of 12 kg is 12 / 4 = 3 kg for Pierre.

1/3 of 12 kg is 12 / 3 = 4 kg for Paul.

Now, let's add the kilograms that Pierre and Paul have: 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, we subtract the amount that Pierre and Paul have from the total: 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left."

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she actually spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide 20 toys by 10 hours, which is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Arnold painted x eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted x eggs.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's say Sarah painted y eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah: 
y + (y + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 
2y + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 
2y = 18

Divide both sides by 2: 
y = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each. We also know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We can write an equation to represent this:
x + x + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine like terms: 
2x + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2x = 26

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 13

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get the number of boxes: 
200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by 8 to get the total weight of the crayons:
25 * 8 = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight of the crayons by 16 to get the weight in pounds:
200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log.

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns. 
So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. 
So, their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together.
$5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can divide 40 minutes by 2 miles to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

40 minutes / 2 miles = 20 minutes per mile

Now, we know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the rate of speed on the beach. So, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

20 minutes per mile / 2 = 10 minutes per mile

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 10 minutes.

Now, we can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8 to get the total amount she has saved so far: 
4 * 8 = 32

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save ($60) to find out how much more she needs to save:
60 - 32 = 28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take:
28 / 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 
   60 - 24 = 36

2. Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles initially, we need to subtract 10 marbles from this number to find out how many marbles he will have after losing 10.
   36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the amount of water in the second mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is x degrees. We also know that the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, we can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means that the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is y degrees. We know that the amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce, and the amount of water in the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces.

We can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * y) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

y = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try again. We know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is at least 40 degrees. We also know that the amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce, and the amount of water in the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces.

We can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * 40 degrees) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 132 = 5

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows:
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to calculate the total cost first. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs. 
Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell paid. 
Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we need to divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that 3 scoops of mashed potatoes require 6 potatoes. 

So, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide 18 scoops by 3 scoops. 

18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. 
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs eaten in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51

Let's divide 84 by 14 to find the value of 1 part:
84 ÷ 14 = 6

Now, we can multiply 6 by 9 to find the number of women on the bus initially:
6 * 9 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women:
54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, 34 women have remained on the bus.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total amount he earns from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. 

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Since we don't know the number of rocks, let's represent it as 'x'. 
Total cost = 5x

Adam sells 60% of his inventory, so the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The total amount he earns from selling the rocks is:
Total earnings = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
Total earnings = 0.6x * 7
Total earnings = 4.2x

Now, we know that Adam invested all his money in the rock stand, so the total cost is equal to the total earnings. We can set up an equation:
5x = 4.2x

However, this equation doesn't make sense because it would mean that Adam has more money than he started with. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6x rocks. This means he has 0.4x rocks left. The total cost of the rocks is still 5x, but the total earnings is 4.2x. 

Let's assume Adam bought x/0.6 = 5/0.6 = 25/3 rocks. This is the total number of rocks he bought.

Now, we can calculate the total cost and total earnings:
Total cost = 5 * (25/3) = 125/3
Total earnings = 4.2 * (25/3) = 35

Since Adam started with $100, we can set up an equation:
100 = 125/3 - 35

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:
300 = 125 - 105
300 = 20

Now we know that Adam bought 20 rocks. The total cost is 5 * 20 = 100. 

Adam started with $100 and spent $100 on rocks. He sold 60% of his inventory, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. The total earnings is 12 * 7 = 84.

Adam loses 100 - 84 = 16.

The final answer is 16."

Since 9 days is the maximum number of days, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project."
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs to a numerical value. One dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen eggs is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, we multiply 31 days by $1.

31 days * $1/day = $31

Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the roses she gave to her mother and then add the roses she bought.

She started with 30 roses.
She gave away 24 roses, so she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left.
Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be written as 0.2.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing 22 by 2.

Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally.

Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 weekend days, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

The first song is 5 minutes, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time. 
5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 x $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

"To find out how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, they don't need to produce any more bottles to meet the demand.

Final answer: 0"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing a bow.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them are dressed in purple, so 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are dressed in purple.
1/4 of them are dressed in blue, so 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Now, 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.

To find the total number of babies wearing a bow, we add the number of blue wearers (2) and the number of purple wearers wearing bows (2), which is 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
The number of babies wearing purple and a bow is 2, and the total number of babies wearing a bow is 4. 
So, the percentage chance is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from this sale.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he earned $30 from this sale.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from this sale.

To find the total amount of money Abraham earned, we need to add the money from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

He changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day. So, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many eggs each person found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we need to first find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) apartments. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments. 

John collects garbage from 3 complexes, 3 times a week. 

He collects garbage from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments per week. 

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1440 * 0.40 = $576 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

Now, we know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she was left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

1/5 of $15 is 15/5 = $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Now, we know that Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money, which is 4/5 * 15 = $12.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, she had $15 - $3 = $12 initially. 

Now, we know that Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, Ronnie is left with $5 + $3 = $8.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of red, white, and purple paint used is x pints each. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of paint used for these three colors is 3x pints.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is half of the total amount of paint, which is 12 pints. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of paint used:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation gives us:

3x = 6

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.2).

Number of pods in the new box = 100 * 1.2 = 120 pods

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with 120 pods for $1. 

Cost per pod = $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod

Number of cycles = Total amount / Cost per pod
= $1 / $0.12
= 8.33 cycles

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, you can run 8 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he has 50 bills initially.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

Now, we need to find out how much chalk is left.

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches.

Let's divide 2.75 by 0.2 (20%):

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So Colin's current age is 20.

$27000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since he has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets he can buy per school.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is cut into and then divide that by the number of slices each friend eats.

For cheese pizza: 12 slices per pizza * 6 friends = 72 slices
For pepperoni pizza: 8 slices per pizza * 6 friends = 48 slices

Since each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, we need to find the total number of slices each friend eats per pizza type and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 6 slices per pizza / 12 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas per friend
For pepperoni pizza: 4 slices per pizza / 8 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas per friend

Since each friend eats 0.5 pizzas per type, we need to find the total number of pizzas needed for each type.

For cheese pizza: 6 friends * 0.5 pizzas per friend = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 6 friends * 0.5 pizzas per friend = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 pizzas of each type, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 2 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 18 snowballs per hour. 

To do this, we divide 60 by 18.

"To find Jim's age, we need to know how old John was when Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim back then, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at that time was x. Then John's age at that time was 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (number of years since then) = 28

Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, we can substitute 20 for the number of years since then:

2x + 20 = 28

Now, let's solve for x:

2x = 28 - 20
2x = 8
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. To find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 19

So, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in the length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings for the hours worked will be:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since she has complete attendance, she also receives an additional $10. So, her total earnings will be:
$270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each task and then add them together.

- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 x $0.50 = $3.00
- He did his laundry once, so he earned $3.00
- He took the trash out twice, so he earned 2 x $0.75 = $1.50
- He cleaned his room once, so he earned $1.50

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in two weeks."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to find the amount of blood a shark has. 

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we need to multiply this amount by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have. 

120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding this to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

He also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since he bought 25 red pens, he bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

Now, let's add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30. So, the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Now, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons among 4 people (Fred and the 3 guests). 

5 gallons / 4 people = 1.25 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.25."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. 

Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

The problem also states that this expression equals 40. So, we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of 66. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of 44. 
5/11 of 44 is 5 * 4 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the height of the first floor: 
   Since the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, 
   the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

2. Then, we find the height of the house: 
   Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison's height, 
   the height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

3. Now, we find the height of the second floor: 
   Since the first floor is 180 inches high, 
   the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

4. Finally, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor:

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first.

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 
2% of $300 is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

Total number of students = 10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

Time taken by 3 full groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes
Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 45 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken by 3 full groups + Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

20 - 4 = 16

Eve gave away 16 pomelos."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
   2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. 
   So, he ate 24 apples and has 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

2. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 
   25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. 
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples and has 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

3. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 
   The total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters is the same as 3/4.

9 * 4 = 36

So, Regina has written 36 novels this year.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he traveled for 3 days, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to follow the steps:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. Since the total grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes, and we know that 48 grapes were used for the pies, the initial number of grapes must be 84 + 48 = 132 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is 132."
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers and the number of substitute teachers.

Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers = 13 + 9 = 22

There were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he buys 1 box per week, so the pasta cost per week is $1.00.

The cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. So, the total cheese cost per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
Total hours worked = 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the total number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase can hold 45 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide 110 by 45.

110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total selling price:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total selling price = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 
   Half of 100 hats is 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

2. Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find the remaining hats: 
   100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.

3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 
   3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

4. Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 
   50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).

70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the questions she got right on the first test from the total questions she needs to get right to pass.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, we can set up the equation:

x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

Combine like terms:

x + 5x - 4 = 116

Combine the 'x' terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"

Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To find out how many marbles Brendan had initially, we know he started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. 

Now, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. Then, he found 3 more marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, he picked up a bead instead of a marble, so we need to subtract 1 from the total. 

8 - 1 = 7

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: First, we need to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we divide 15 by 1.5 (since 2 customers result in 1 car sold). 
15 / 1.5 = 10 customers

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 10 customers. Since for every 25 calls, 1 customer comes in, we divide 10 by 0.4 (since 25 calls result in 1 customer). 
10 / 0.4 = 25

So, Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. 

There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110 chips.

Since there are 5 family members, we divide the total number of chips by 5 to find out how many chips each person gets. 

110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips per person.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
20 * 2 = x
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
20 * 2 = y
y = 40

Now that we know there are 40 robots, 40 footballs, and 20 helmets, we can find the total number of items:
Total items = 40 (robots) + 40 (footballs) + 20 (helmets)
Total items = 100

The total number of items Dominick saw is 100."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the hours to minutes and then divide by the time it takes to deal with a call.

6 hours = 6 * 60 minutes = 360 minutes

Now, divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5:
24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls per week

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in drying time. To do this, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply 10 dozen by 30 days.

10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day
120 doughnuts per day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut.

3600 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $7200

Derrick makes $7200 in June."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 60 seconds is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds.
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in the first 90 seconds is 80 + 240 = 320.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate of the past 30 seconds was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds.
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in 120 seconds is 320 + 120 = 440.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.
   So, 30 more kernels pop from the residual heat.
   The total number of kernels popped is 440 + 30 = 470.

Garrett has 470 pieces of popcorn."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as the other gallons:
2 * 1 cup = 2 cups

Now, we add this to the total amount of lemon juice needed for the other 4 gallons:
2 cups + 5 cups = 7 cups

Now, we multiply the total cups by the number of lemons per cup:
7 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 42 lemons

So, Tim will need 42 lemons in total."

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

We know that the bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies is 43."

Now, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. 
Cost of one bus trip = 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel
Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80
Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 * $80
Cost of one bus trip = $8

Now, we need to find the total cost of the bus trips. 
Number of bus trips = 7
Total cost of bus trips = $8 * 7
Total cost of bus trips = $56

Now, we need to find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels.

The cost of the child ticket is $8. Since there is one child, the total cost for the child ticket is $8.

The cost of 2 popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost for the popcorns is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 (adult ticket) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and Emma is 16 years older than Mia, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years.

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2. 

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
= (40 + 56) / 2
= 96 / 2
= 48

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells each person found and subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

Total number of seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732

Number of cracked seashells = 67

Number of good seashells = Total number of seashells - Number of cracked seashells
= 732 - 67
= 665

The final answer is: 665"
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $6.00 = $72.00

For the bowls, Avery needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

For the salad plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, let's add the costs together:
$72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. 

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours. 

Now, we add 2 hours to this half of Steve's time to find Anna's time. 

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 days = 40 pounds of feed per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds of feed per week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total amount.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to add the number of guests and the leftover hot dogs. 

20 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs
40 hot dogs + 4 leftover hot dogs = 44 hot dogs

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide 44 by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs 8 packs of hot dogs.

8 packs * $2 per pack = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's calculate her total income:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money Frances has left:
$80 (total income) - $20 (total expenses) = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The original 5 children are already following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so we subtract them from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

There are 25 children now following the truck."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she gave out from the total number of meals she had.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals Mamou had = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals Mamou had - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 
25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, we can multiply 12 by 2 to find the age of the older brother. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16. 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings together: 
12 + 24 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so she meditates for 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so she practices yoga for 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she meditates for 210 * 4 = 840 minutes and practices yoga for 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time she spends on meditation and yoga is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"

For small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt: 
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to first find the number of seeds in a small sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply 3 by 12 to get the total number of seeds in a small sunflower.

3 * 12 = 36

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we can multiply 36 by 0.5.

36 * 0.5 = 18

Now, we add the 50% (18) to the number of seeds in a small sunflower (36) to find the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

36 + 18 = 54

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower (36) and a large sunflower (54) to find the total number of seeds.

36 + 54 = 90

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow the information given in the problem.

George has 18 pens. 
Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens: 18 * 3 = 54 pens.

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we divide Timothy's pens by 2: 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The first T-shirt costs $8.
The second T-shirt costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40. The shoes are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.4 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

"Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies
5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes Nate's dog dug during his vacation and then find out how many holes Nate fills in per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to find the net change in holes per day. 
The net change is 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. 
We divide the total number of holes by the net change in holes per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

The final answer is: 4"

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average.

To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
- Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, so B = 7.

Now, we know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. We can write an equation to represent this:
T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know, we get:
8 + 7 + 16 = 29

This equation is true, so we don't need to do anything else. However, we want to find out how many beakers Igor lost. We know that Igor had 7 beakers and the total number of items is 29. Since the total number of test tubes and Petri dishes is 8 + 16 = 24, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
29 - 24 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs.
The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Let's say Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we need to find out how long it took her to run that distance. 

Since Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed
16 = 1 / x (since Aaron ran 1 mile)

Now we can solve for x:
x = 1 / 16
x = 0.0625 miles per minute

Now that we know x, we can find Vanessa's time:
Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / 0.0625
Time = 128 minutes

The final answer is: 128"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate how much line he needs for the existing dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line for the dock.

He already has 6 feet of line, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of line needed for the dock. 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week).

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- They get 6 reservations a night.
- Each reservation has 2 meals that cost $5 each, so 2 x $5 = $10 per meal.
- They also get a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
- So, the total revenue per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.
- Since they get 6 reservations a night, the daily revenue is 6 x $15 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the weekly revenue:
- They are open 2 days a week, so the weekly revenue is 2 x $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

To find the cost of one watermelon, we divide the total cost by 50:
$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we calculate 25% of the cost of one watermelon:
25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Now, we add the profit to the cost of one watermelon to get the selling price:
$1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they start at the same time, we can assume that they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute. 

Let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

Ana will spend 3x minutes peeling x oranges, and Jane will spend 4x minutes peeling x oranges.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can set up the equation:

3x + 4x = 60

Combine like terms:

7x = 60

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 60/7
x = 8.57 (round down to 8, since you can't peel a fraction of an orange)

So, Ana peels 8 oranges in the first minute, and Jane peels 8 oranges in the first minute.

Now, let's calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour:

Ana peels 8 oranges/minute * 60 minutes = 480 oranges
Jane peels 8 oranges/minute * 60 minutes = 480 oranges

Since they peel the same number of oranges in an hour, the difference is 0 oranges.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320.

The cost of the new radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours. So, the labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4): 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
