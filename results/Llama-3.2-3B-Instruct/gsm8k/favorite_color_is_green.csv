"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, so she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells at the market. She has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.

Janet sells each egg for $2, so she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3

Total meters per week = 3 * 60 = 180 meters

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given to the chickens.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives 3 meals a day, and she has already given 2 meals, she needs to give the remaining 1 meal.

Total feed needed for the final meal = Total feed given so far
Total feed needed for the final meal = 800 cups

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * 0.6 * $5 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. This takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 40 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes + 40 minutes = 80 minutes.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts.

1. The first part: John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 60 * 3
   Distance = 180 miles

2. The second part: John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.
   Distance = 0 miles

3. The third part: John drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 30 * 0.5
   Distance = 15 miles

4. The fourth part: John drives for 3.5 hours at 80 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 80 * 3.5
   Distance = 280 miles

Now, we add up the distances from each part to find the total distance John traveled.
Total Distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 280
Total Distance = 455 miles

John is 455 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings are:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost of $90.

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to break even and start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 vacuum cleaners.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/3 - 2) / 2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x - 4 - x/3 + 2 = 10

Combine like terms:

2x - x/3 - 2 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - x - 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

5x = 36

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 36 / 5

x = 7.2

Since Melanie can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is not a whole number, which is unusual for this type of problem. 

The final answer is 7."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential profit: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
Total value: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential profit: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
Total value: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the total value of the jewelry ($5,125) is greater than the total value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit. 

The final numerical answer is: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. 

On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
$20/hour * 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000

Her annual salary from coaching: 
$30/hour * 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500

Total annual salary: 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply 21 eggs per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to complete the 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour on the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 8 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the total amount of water becomes 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The remaining 24 liters is the total amount of liquid after spilling, so the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 16 liters.

"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond and his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75). 

Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - (60 - 15) = 15 miles

Now, we add the two distances together: 40 + 15 = 55 miles

Henry traveled 55 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find Allen's age, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 11 = 18.

We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.

7x + 11x = 162
18x = 162
x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now, we know that Allen's age is 11x, so Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person said 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person said 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day:

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know he had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. The question asks how many Lego sets he still has, but the information given doesn't provide any information about the number of Lego sets he has left after selling them."
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day, so the distance covered is 60 miles.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per day.
- Total distance covered on the other two days is 30 * 2 = 60 miles.
- Total distance covered in a week is 60 + 60 = 120 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
- Total time spent running on the other two days is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.
- Total time spent running in a week is 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate his running speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 20 miles per hour.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To find the distance Polly could stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings: 300g / 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48g.

The final answer is 48."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. The cost of the beeswax and the wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, net profit = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

The net profit is -$160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

Total notes = 80 + 220 = 300

Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can find the number of notes in the package by subtracting the remaining notes from the total notes.

Notes in the package = Total notes - Remaining notes
= 300 - 23
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). 

200 / 40 = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of 15 floors. 

3/4 * 15 = 11.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a unit, we'll round down to 11 occupied units.

Now, we'll find the total number of units in the building: 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

The total number of unoccupied units is: 
120 - 11 = 109 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since we are looking for the amount more earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one outing.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: 1596"

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = approximately 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles per gallon."
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He spends half as long reading, so he spends 2 / 2 = 1 hour reading per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

Now, we know the total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:
Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total students = 120 + 60
Total students = 180

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers:

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as x. Then, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
x = 36

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his improved time. Since his speed improved by 10%, we can multiply his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement):
Gerald's improved time = 1.1 * 36
Gerald's improved time = 39.6

The final answer is 39.6."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply 32 by 2 to get the total volume of the tomatoes. 

32 * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide 64 by 16 to find out how many cans of tomatoes she used.

64 / 16 = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply 4 by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

4 * 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, and there were originally 30 cars. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 
So, the total number of plants she has is: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 
So, the number of plants she will have left is: 
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 5 * 1 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 1 glass of water on Sunday. 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekends is 2.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week.
Total glasses of water in a week = 5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has placed, we first need to find out how many pieces she started with. Since she placed a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we calculate that as 1000 * 0.25 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To do that, we first need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy places her 250 pieces. That would be 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

Then, we calculate a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * 0.33 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

The final answer is 500."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions of each box.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting the wall thickness of 1 inch from each dimension, we get:

Inner length: 5 - 1 = 4 inches
Inner width: 6 - 1 = 5 inches
Inner height: 4 - 1 = 3 inches

Now, we multiply the inner dimensions to find the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = length * width * height = 4 * 5 * 3 = 60 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 60 * 3 = 180 cubic inches

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days and subtract that from the total time he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time watched on other days from the total time: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 to find the number of episodes: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Average = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. 

Since Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can find the rate of feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Now, we can find the total number of sets of 10 feet Julia rowed: 64 seconds / 16 seconds per set = 4 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply the number of sets by 2: 4 sets * 2 liters/set = 8 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many ducks are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total costs of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation: 
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary. 
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

"To find the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters were stamped. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate the number of letters stamped as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters stamped = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. To find the initial number of letters in the pile, we can subtract the number of letters stamped from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters stamped

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. The sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his total earnings in a week would be 14 * $10 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the tax on non-food items first. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. 

The total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.
The tax on non-food items is 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar.

Now, let's add the cost of food items (milk and eggs) to the total cost of non-food items and the tax.
The total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.
The total cost of everything is 10 + 1 + 5 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. He has 3 clients, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, he will need 3 * 2 = 6 bottles of bleach and 3 packs of cloths.

The total cost of bleach will be 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of cloths will be 3 * $5 = $15.

The total expenses will be $12 + $15 = $27.

Since Kim's total income is $92, his profit will be $92 - $27 = $65.

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 that left fly from the hive and leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. So, the total number of bees that have left so far is 30 (initial) + 60 (new) = 90 bees.
6. Since 45 bees have already returned, the number of bees that still need to return is 90 (left) - 45 (returned) = 45 bees.
7. In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees return to the hive, which is 45 bees.

Therefore, Debra sees 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change. So, the amount of money she gave the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has: 
12 / 3 = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply this number by 4 to find out how many friends James has: 
4 * 4 = 16

James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve is faster, he will finish the race first. To find the waiting time, we subtract Tim's time from Steve's time:

Waiting time = Steve's time - Tim's time
Waiting time = 36 minutes - 40 minutes
Waiting time = -4 minutes

Since the waiting time can't be negative, we need to re-evaluate the situation. Since Steve is faster, he will actually finish before Tim, and Tim will be waiting for Steve. The correct calculation is:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time
Waiting time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes
Waiting time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: 
$10 - $6 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The seagull ate 7 fries, so the remaining fries are 14 - 7 = 7.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are 7 - 9 = -2. However, since we can't have negative fries, we need to re-evaluate the situation. Let's assume the initial pack had x fries. After the seagull ate 7, the remaining fries are x - 7.
6. The pigeons ate 9 fries, so the remaining fries are (x - 7) - 9 = x - 16.
7. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 16).
8. The remaining fries are (x - 16) - (2/3)(x - 16).
9. Ants carried off 1 fry, so the remaining fries are (x - 16) - (2/3)(x - 16) - 1.
10. We know that the remaining fries are 5, so we can set up the equation: (x - 16) - (2/3)(x - 16) - 1 = 5.

Now, let's solve the equation:

(x - 16) - (2/3)(x - 16) - 1 = 5
x - 16 - (2/3)x + 32/3 - 1 = 5
(1/3)x + 11/3 = 5
(1/3)x = 5 - 11/3
(1/3)x = (15 - 11)/3
(1/3)x = 4/3
x = 4

The initial number of fries in the pack was 4."
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.
Converting the total length of the croissants to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs 15 times back and forth on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire 100 yards twice for each run. So, the total distance Blake runs is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 40 yards twice for each run. So, the total distance Kelly runs is 34 * 2 * 40 = 2720 yards.

Since 3000 yards is greater than 2720 yards, Blake wins the contest. 

The difference in distance between the winner and the loser is 3000 - 2720 = 280 yards.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3, which is (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of an action figure as follows:

1 red car = $4
1 action figure = 3 * $4 = $12

Now, we know the cost of an action figure. We can calculate the cost of the other items:

5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20
3 action figures = 3 * $12 = $36
1 doll = $12

Now, we can add up the costs of all the toys to find the total value:

$20 (red cars) + $36 (action figures) + $12 (doll) = $68

The total value of all the toys is $68.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since the problem doesn't mention the age of the fourth bird, we can't determine its age. However, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know: 8 + 19 + 16 = 43.

Since they sell each gallon for $10 and it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since they made $25 in profit, the total revenue must be $25 + $5 = $30.

Now, we can divide the total revenue by the revenue per gallon to find the total gallons sold: $30 / $10 = 3 gallons.

Since they spent $5 per gallon on lemons, the total amount spent on lemons is 3 * $5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members: 160 - 60 = 100.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.

"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

Since both probabilities are equal, the difference between them is 0%."
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom. 

Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so she picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the straw used for the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.

Next, let's calculate the straw used for the rabbits: 20 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

The trader bought 114 bags."
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

Total amount of insects per week: 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week: 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years: 
10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees a year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:
100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of trees Tom had after 10 years. To do this, we multiply the total number of trees by 0.3:
80 trees * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had after 10 years:
80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, as he edits an equal number for both publishers. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups.

"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she needs to earn $60 in total, and she can earn $5 per babysitting session, she can earn $60 in 12 babysitting sessions. However, she needs to earn $60 in total, and she can earn $4 per lawn mowing session. So, she needs to mow the lawn 15 - 12 = 3 more times.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water in the last 4 minutes. The big pool has also lost 16 gallons of water in the last 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool had 2x gallons 4 minutes ago, it has lost 2x - 4x = -2x gallons in the last 4 minutes. However, we know it has lost 16 gallons, so -2x = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 8.

So, the small pool had 8 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it has lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes, it now has 8 - 16 = -8 gallons. However, since we can't have negative gallons, this means the small pool is empty.

The final answer is 0."

"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she borrowed. 

The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, the total amount Janeth borrowed is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she will pay $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount borrowed: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Harriet's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Adrian's age in 3 years) / 3

68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54

The final answer is: 54"

The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. 
A third of that amount is 15000 / 3 = 5000. 
So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years: 
15000 + 5000 = 20000.

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is 20000."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new total is:
90 - 8 = 82

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards, so the new total is:
82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
He had 40 water type cards initially and lost 8, so the new number of water type cards is:
40 - 8 = 32

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"To find the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat is $2.00.
Extra cheese is $1.00.
Avocado is $1.00.
2 sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The upgrade is $3.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $0.50 = $10.00
$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:
$13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

Chad still owes $8.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

60 / 60 = 1 hour

The answer is 1."
"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready = 84 - 63 = 21

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to know that there are half as many bugs as ants. Since there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of ants and bugs. 
Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, the total number of penguins that leave is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced per vine.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies. 
Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can add 6 to Robert's candies to find James' candies.
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we can find out how many more candies John has than James by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.
John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33
John's candies - James' candies = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he sends and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he sends 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of minutes in a week by the number of minutes it takes him to write one page to find out how many hours he spends writing per week. 

420 minutes / 6 minutes per page = 70 pages per week
70 pages / 5 pages per letter = 14 letters per week
14 letters / 2 letters per week (he receives and sends) = 7 letters per week

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends writing per week. 

7 letters per week * 5 pages per letter = 35 pages per week
35 pages per week / 5 pages per hour = 7 hours per week

The final answer is: 7"

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and adds them to the existing 20 stalls. So, the total number of cows in the 20 stalls is 20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) = 60 cows.

Now, we divide the total number of cows (60) by the number of stalls (20) to find out how many cows are in each stall: 60 / 20 = 3 cows per stall.

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall (3) by 8: 3 * 8 = 24 cows.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Net proceeds: $400,000 - $368,000 = $32,000

The final answer is: $32,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating up the oil, heating up to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating up the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating up to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 20 minutes - 5 minutes = 15 minutes

Now, let's add up the time: 20 + 28 + 15 = 63 minutes

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$75 * 15 = $1125

To find the total amount spent on all ads, add the amounts spent on newspaper and television ads: 
$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

The answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the total number of M&Ms: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

To find the total number of windows in the additional windows not connected to bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the costs of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards
2. Calculate the remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter A: 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. Calculate the remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter B: 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. Calculate the number of cards with the letter D: 24 - 15 = 9 cards

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide that information. 

Let's assume their current ages are x and y. We know that x + y = 20. 

In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the second equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles: 20 popsicles * $0.25 = $5
The cost of the ice cream bars: 4 ice cream bars * $0.50 = $2

Now, let's add the costs together: $5 + $2 = $7

So, Peter paid a total of $7."
"To find the number of spots on the mambas, we first need to find the number of spots on one mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba. 

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the mambas. 

Total spots on mambas = 35 * 60 = 2100

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras. 

Total spots on cobras = 70 * 40 = 2800

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the snakes. 

Total spots on all snakes = 2100 + 2800 = 4900

Finally, we can find half the number of spots on all the snakes. 

Half the total spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

The total number of people attending the soccer game is 15 (team members and coaches) + 30 (guests) = 45.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225.

225"
"To find the total length of the space between the gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

There are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Now, subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by 0.25 to find the number of beads: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week: 20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 120 = 280 stories.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The cost of the pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8. 

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have in total. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. 

So, 39 = 10 * x / 10. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 10. 

39 * 10 = 10 * x 
390 = 10x 

Now, divide both sides by 10. 

390 / 10 = x 
x = 39 

The final answer is 39."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she worked.

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she worked for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she paused for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she worked. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked. 150 / 10 = 15.

So, she worked 15 intervals of 10 minutes each. Since she earns $5 for each interval, she earns 15 * 5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the points of each player, we need to calculate their points before the extra points.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if they have over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round.
- Mike has 21 points, so yes.
- Jim has 18 points, so no.
- Tony has 42 points, so yes.

Since they all get an extra point, their new points are:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim: 18 + 0 = 18
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up their points to find the total.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The rice will last for 3 weeks."

The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250.
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300.
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $350, $400, and $450.

Carmen wins the desk at the $500 bid. 

The desk costs her $500."
"To calculate the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total distance driven per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Distance driven per day = 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles
Distance driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Distance driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving per year = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gets a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus per year is:
Total bonus per year = $150 * 12 months = $1,800

Total cost per year = Total cost of driving per year + Total bonus per year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost of the trip: 
$1950 - $2000 = -$50

However, since you can't spend a negative amount, we need to recalculate the cost of the flight ticket. 
Let's rephrase the problem: 
The flight ticket costs 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit plus $700. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost of the trip: 
$1950 - $2000 = -$50

However, since you can't spend a negative amount, we need to recalculate the cost of the flight ticket. 
Let's rephrase the problem: 
The flight ticket costs 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit plus $700.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40
   Noah's age six years ago = 40

2. Now, we can calculate Noah's current age:
   Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
   Noah's current age = 40 + 6
   Noah's current age = 46

3. Now, we can calculate the population of Chile six years ago:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
   Population of Chile six years ago = 120000

4. Now, we can calculate the population of Chile now:
   Population of Chile now = Population of Chile six years ago * 2
   Population of Chile now = 120000 * 2
   Population of Chile now = 240000

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms: 7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the beginning, we need to add the number of men and women.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have is 3x + 2 + 46. 

We know that the total number of pencils is 26. So, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3
x = -7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense)

However, let's re-examine the problem. We can assume that the 3 boxes are full, and the 2 loose pencils are the ones that make up the difference between the total number of pencils and the number of pencils in the boxes. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have is 3x + 2. We know that this total is 26. 

3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

Now, we know that each box has 8 pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, so she has 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 24 + 46 = 70. 

Since each box has 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 
70 / 8 = 8.75 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes were used. 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

The added cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for each new one, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each new record was obtained by trading 2 old records, we multiply the number of new records by 2 to get the total number of old records.

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of people who got off at the second stop. 
7 people got off at the second stop.

Now, we know that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. 
We also know that 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal and got on the bus at the second stop is 20 - 7 = 13.

Since we already know that 5 people got on at the first stop, the remaining 8 people who got on at the second stop must have also gotten on at the terminal. 

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Oscar has 31 lollipops."
"To find the total time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they got 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they got were $4, but the coupon took twice that amount off, which is $8. 

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the total amount spent: 
$80 - $4 (rewards) - $8 (coupon discount) = $68

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To calculate the net pay for Job A, we need to first calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes.

Total income for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
Total tax for Job A: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To calculate the net pay for Job B, we need to first calculate the net income after property tax, then apply the tax rate.

Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Net pay for Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay for both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay.

Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: 8400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to calculate the amount Thomas ate first. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students.

We know that the total number of students is 200. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students.

40"
"To find the number of chickens and cows, we know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'x'. Then the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

Total legs = (20 cows * 4 legs) + (40 chickens * 2 legs)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh has, we need to calculate the number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week. 

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. 
- Week 1: 3 balls
- Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
- Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
- Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can find the weight of the other animals as follows:

- The blue beetle weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight + (pink frog weight + blue beetle weight + green toad weight + yellow snake weight + red bird weight)
= 20 + (50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30)
= 20 + 240
= 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel received 24 outfits from her friend.
She received twice that amount at the baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

"To find the new distance Tyson runs each day, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new distance Tyson runs each day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day
Revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day

The difference in revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100 per day.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his time was spent sightseeing. We can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25.

Morgan has a $90 budget, and she wants to spend $25 on activities. So, the remaining budget for her friends is $90 - $25 = $65.

Since each friend will get $5 in arcade tokens, we can divide the remaining budget by $5 to find out how many friends she can invite. $65 / $5 = 13.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

0"
"To find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs, we need to calculate the total cost of the gumballs. 

Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left from his original $10. This means he spent $10 - $2 = $8 on candy.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on candy ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5).

$8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: 
C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:
45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S
S = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled per day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels per day by the distance it travels between services. 

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider the train's service interval in terms of days, so we'll keep the answer as a decimal for accuracy.

The train goes between services approximately 0.0375 days per trip."

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before. 
We know Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

So Sara had 4.67 points before. 
Since Erin had 3 times more points than Sara, Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before."

2. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.
3. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.
4. The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday, and she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday, she picked 2 * 14 = 28 apples on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 28 (Wednesday) = 54 apples

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten by her brother from the total number of cookies she initially had.

Total cookies initially = 23 (Rachel's cookies) + 42 (Janet's cookies) = 65 cookies
Cookies eaten by her brother = 44

Cookies left = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten by her brother
= 65 - 44
= 21

There are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate and divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12 = 0.008333 (approximately)

Total amount = $3,650
Number of months = 5

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
= $3,650 / 5

So, Karan has to pay $730 per month.

The final answer is: $730"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho hiked 14 km/h * 8 hours = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe hiked 9 km/h * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances.

112 kilometers (Cho) - 45 kilometers (Chloe) = 67 kilometers.

Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 - $18 = $18

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 + 26 = 52. However, half of them can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 52 / 2 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26. 

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people who can make it. 

The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

First, we add up the scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Dasha saves $30 - $18 = $12.

So, David saves $12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

"To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 6 = 11. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of parts for Sam (6) by the value of each part (15): 6 * 15 = 90.

We do the same for Betty: 5 * 15 = 75.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we can add up the time spent on each activity:
4 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100 = 21.43%

The final answer is: 21.43"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. 

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we need to find double the capacity first. 

Double the capacity is 2 * 36 = 72 books.

Then, we add 20 more books to that, so 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards received: 17
Cards given away: 29

Total cards Erica now has: 50 + 17 - 29 = 38

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. 

1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we can add them together:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, and she eats 2 slices, we need to subtract 2 from 7/12.

To subtract 2 from 7/12, we can convert 2 to 24/12 (since 2 * 12 = 24) and then subtract:
7/12 - 24/12 = -17/12

Since we can't have a negative number of slices, we need to convert -17/12 to a mixed number. 
-17/12 = -1 7/12

So, Jenny has -1 7/12 slices left."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from his initial savings and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Initial savings: $50

"To find the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks in a month and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the builder works 4 * 4 = 16 weeks per year.
Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the builder works 16 * 52 = 832 weeks per year.

Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of working days in a year is 832 * 6 = 4992 days.

The builder gets paid $50 per day, so his total earnings per year are 4992 * 50 = $249,600.

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of milk per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

In 30 days, the total energy usage would be 7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert the total energy usage to kilowatts:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage would be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

In 30 days, the new total energy usage would be 2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new energy usage:
216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

To convert the energy saved to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:
135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

"To find the total number of stripes, we need to add the stripes of all zebras together. 

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, we have 34 + 36 = 70 stripes. 
The last zebra has half the number of stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 
Now, we add the stripes of all zebras together: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

"To determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100. 

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 
So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 
To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
Total amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees. 
Total amount paid in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, Joanne gathers S/2 apples from the shortest trees, and her sister gathers 3 times as many, so her sister gathers 3S apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

We also know that T = 30 and 2T = 60, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

30 + S + A = 500

We also know that S/2 = 3S, so S = 60.

Now we can substitute S = 60 into the equation:

30 + 60 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + A = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

A = 410

The final answer is: 410"
"To find the number of dromedaries, we need to first find the number of camels. 

Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can set up an equation based on the number of bumps (humps). 

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that:

2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, and there are 304 bumps in total)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each camel has 1 head and each dromedary has 1 head, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations:

2C + D = 304
C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into one of the original equations:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. 
   50 - (4 * 5) = 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.

2. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse.
   3/5 * 30 = 18 cats ran after the mouse.

3. To find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats.
   30 - 18 = 12 cats left.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 20 months.

The first 6 months cost 6 * $8 = $48.
The next 8 months cost 8 * $12 = $96.
The last 20 months cost 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, let's add the costs together: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The final answer is: 424"
"To find the cost of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total savings from the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the rest of the savings (2/3) must be from the tattered jeans. 

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as x. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The total savings from the jogger jeans is $6. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x = 6
x = 18

The cost of the jogger jeans is $18. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $28 - $18 = $10.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

570"
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the cost of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price. 

25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
The cost of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake: 
$5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, he sold 2/3x cards. 

Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, the total amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5 * (2/3x) = 1x.

We know that he has $100 - $50 = $50 left after selling the cards. So, 1x = 50.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 1: x = 50.

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since there were only 18 prepared for two hotdogs, we need to find out how many extra hotdogs were needed. 

The extra hotdogs needed would be 40 - 18 = 22. Since each guest needs one more hotdog, 22 extra hotdogs are needed.

Since there were only 18 prepared for two hotdogs, the caterer would have to give out 22 hotdogs to 18 guests, which means 4 guests would not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount:
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15 * 0.25 = 3.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints. 

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate the total cost of the chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of $5 is $0.05. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars ($4.95) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents). 

$4.95 / 0.75 = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to 6 candy bars.

The final answer is 6."

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who had a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."

"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions: 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00
The cost of the beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00
The total cost of the ingredients: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 
The cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

The total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $8.00 = $16.00

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is: $16.00 / 6 = $2.67

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We also know that James won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 10 minutes less than Jon's. 
James' run time is 50 - 10 = 40 minutes.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the cost of the super ticket and the regular ticket with popcorn and soda.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2, so the cost of the regular ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The cost of the regular ticket is $18, and you paid $12, so the cost of the ticket alone is $18 - $12 = $6.

You paid $3 for the soda. Since you bought one soda with the regular ticket, the cost of the soda is $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn. The total cost of the regular ticket and the soda is $18 + $3 = $21. Since the cost of the ticket alone is $6, the cost of the popcorn is $21 - $6 = $15.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

He starts with 200 shoes.
On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 200 + 5 = 205 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, so he now has 205 + 15 = 220 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, so he now has 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.
On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so he now has 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

"To find the total number of pencils used, we first need to find the total number of pencils initially. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

1/5 of the total pencils were used, so the number of pencils used is 300 * 1/5 = 60.

The remaining pencils are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is 240 * 1/3 = 80.

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of students, we need to first find the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the total number of students.
3/4 * x = number of students with desktop computers

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students with desktop computers is x - 20.

We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = x - 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 4x - 80

Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 80

Adding 80 to both sides gives us:

80 = x

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls who are 64"" tall. 
4 * 64 = 256 inches

The next layer consists of 3 girls who stand on top of the 4. 
Since the 10th girl is 60"" tall, the average height of this layer is (64 + 60) / 2 = 62 inches. 
3 * 62 = 186 inches

The next layer consists of 2 girls who stand on top of the 3. 
Since the 9 girls who are 64"" tall are already in the bottom layer, the average height of this layer is 60 inches. 
2 * 60 = 120 inches

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 
256 + 186 + 120 = 562 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 
562 / 12 = 46.83 feet

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the quarts each person can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, then add the number of loaves returned.

Total loaves baked = 200
Loaves sold in the morning = 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132
Loaves left after sales = 200 - 132 = 68
Loaves after return = 68 + 6 = 74

The bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
New weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

The cost of the original weekly consumption: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126
The cost of the new weekly consumption: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in the weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (2 times 5 days). 

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of chairs Ophelia has is x. 
Then, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2. 
Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation: 
x - 2 = 20 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 22 

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has. 
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. 

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have. 
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 66 chairs. 
The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 + 22 + 66 = 108."
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of the printer, we need to subtract $400 from the cost of the computer. 

Cost of the computer = $1,100
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,800. We also know that the total cost of all three items is $2,400. 

Cost of the computer and the printer = $1,800
Cost of the monitors = $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2 = $300"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 20 kids in total, the number of boys is half of 20, which is 10. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Since George has 3 candies left after eating 5, we can find out how many candies he had initially by adding 5 to 3. 
George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies initially.

"To find the thickness of the third book, we need to subtract 5 mm from the thickness of the second book. 

The thickness of the third book = 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm

The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. 

The thickness of the fourth book = 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm

Now, we can find the total thickness of the four books by adding the thickness of all four books.

Total thickness = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

You will be paying $60 in total."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the amount he needs to save in the first half of the month. 

$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2.

$562.50 * 2 = $1125

However, this is the total amount he needs to save in the second half, and there are 15 days in the second half of April. To find out how much he needs to save each day, we can divide the total amount by 15.

$1125 / 15 = $75

So, Elvis needs to save $75 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:
5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find the total number of families notified, we need to calculate the number of families notified in each round and add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified:

"To find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we need to calculate the time it takes on a hot day and a cold day separately.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time for 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time for 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James needs 12 candles for him and 8 candles for his younger son. 

The total number of candles James needs is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12 on candles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

3. Richie scored 80 goals.

Let's start by finding the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation:
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up another equation:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell: 21
Price of each lemonade: $4
Total amount Mitchell made: 21 * 4 = $84

Now, let's compare the amount Mitchell made to the amount Liam made. 

Liam made: $63
Mitchell made: $84

To find the difference, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made: 
$84 - $63 = $21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

"To find out how much Peter spent on wooden action figures, we need to calculate the total amount spent on them. Since he spent an equal amount each day from Sunday to Wednesday, and he has $70, he spent $70 / 4 = $17.50 per day on wooden action figures.

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he bought is $17.50 / $5 = 3.5. However, since you can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 3 wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount of money Peter has: $70 - $17.50 = $52.50.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is $52.50 / $2 = 26.25. Again, we'll round down to 26 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures + 26 plastic action figures = 29 action figures by the end of the week."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

Spaying the kitten: $200
Vaccines: 3 vaccines * $20 each = $60

Total cost: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses he supplies per week by 4.

40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses the shops order in a month:

20 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 80 roses/month
15 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 60 roses/month
30 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 roses/month

Total roses ordered in a month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total roses supplied from the total roses ordered to find out how many roses Ford lacks:

260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600.

Final answer: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 10 / 10 = 1 loaf
Cost of bread = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Since the cost is given per 10 sandwiches, we need to calculate the cost for 10 sandwiches:
Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The net profit of the food truck is $37.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. 

She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 
3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.
192 / 8 = 24 muffins

Now, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.
24 * $1.50 = $36

"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature and multiply by 100.

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
= 468 - 450
= 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the new set temperature that is 4% higher than the actual temperature.

New set temperature = Actual temperature + (Actual temperature * Percentage off)
= 468 + (468 * 0.04)
= 468 + 18.72
= 486.72

So, Maggie should set the oven to 487 (rounding to the nearest whole number) if her recipe calls for 520 degrees.

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 
10% of $100.00 is $10.00, so the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, and Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total number of contacts he will get is 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of jelly beans of each color. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of people she invited her friends to bring.

Alex invited 100 people.
Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.
Alex also invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of additional guests from her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the total number of people invited by Alex, the additional guests from the initial invitations, and the additional guests from her friends: 
100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 10 * 2 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The boots cost $13 on eBay, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost of the boots on Amazon from the cost of the boots on eBay. 

$21 (eBay) - $16 (Amazon) = $5

The boots are $5 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

Simplifying the equation:
x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find the total number of rotations, we need to multiply the number of miles driven by the number of rotations per mile. 

First, we find the total number of rotations per month: 
400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

The tire needs to be replaced in 3 years."

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20
Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 by 12:

28 * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The answer is 84."
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Now, let's find the difference in cost between Monica's and Lewis' streets.

Cost for Monica's street: $194 * 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,437,625

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,437,625 = $2,937,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,937,625."

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in Mb per second = 20 kb / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply her speed by 60 to get the speed in Mb per minute:

0.02 Mb per second * 60 seconds per minute = 1.2 Mb per minute

Now, multiply her speed in Mb per minute by 60 to get the speed in Mb per hour:

1.2 Mb per minute * 60 minutes per hour = 72 Mb per hour

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
Height difference: 48 - 40 = 8 inches

Annual growth rate: 2 inches

To find the number of years, we divide the height difference by the annual growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is $17,500 * 10 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25 (100% - 60% = 40%). 
0.4 * 25 = 10.

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: 
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $1600
- Silver jewel: $1200

Total price for all three jewels = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price for all three jewels = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
Total price for all three jewels = 4800

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

Maximum number of classes = Total cost / Cost per class
Maximum number of classes = $60 / $10
Maximum number of classes = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales from green hats. 

Let's denote the sales from green hats as G. Since the sales from red hats were $400 and it's half the total amount from green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G
G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:
Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800

The monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (monthly cost for 12 months) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the cooking time for beans, we need to first find the cooking time for pork. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is:
s + g = 20

We can solve these equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'g':
(2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70
This simplifies to:
-2s = -30
Dividing both sides by -2 gives us:
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 
The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the total cost of the items Gus bought, we need to add the cost of the chips, the bucket of fried chicken, and the bottle of soda.

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the chips, the bucket of fried chicken, and the bottle of soda: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, we subtract the total cost of the items he bought from the total amount he spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars.

Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 8 good days in the first 8 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 8 = 28.

However, we know that Christina had 30 days in total. Since 12 + 8 + 8 = 28, the remaining 2 days must be neutral.

Now, we need to subtract the 2 neutral days from the total number of good days. 28 - 2 = 26.

The final answer is 26."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. The difference between 600 and 240 is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide 360 by 30 to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches. 

360 / 30 = 12

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James bought toys for the 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. However, 3 dogs were gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs now.
6. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending it by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

There is also a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 2y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 2y = 34

Divide both sides by 2:

x + y = 17

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write another equation:

x = y + 7

Substitute x in the first equation:

(y + 7) + y = 17

Combine like terms:

2y + 7 = 17

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2y = 10

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 5

Now that we know y, we can find x:

x = y + 7
x = 5 + 7
x = 12

So, one of the twins is 12 years old.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

Since we want to know the total number of coins Rong has saved after 10 years, we multiply the number of coins he saves per year by 10. 
240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Neil saves 28 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since we want to know the total number of coins Neil has saved after 10 years, we multiply the number of coins he saves per year by 10. 
336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount of gravel Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total.

So, 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he initially received. 

Since the total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5, and Gerald received 3 parts, we can calculate his share as follows:

Gerald's share = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so he had:

60 - 10 = 50

Gerald had $50 left.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 80% of the 40% is used for industrial purposes, we need to find the percentage of the total water that 40% represents.

Let's assume the total water is 100%. Then, 40% of 100% is 40%. Since 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage of the total water used for industrial purposes by multiplying 40% by 80%:

40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

100% - 32% = 68%

So, the city uses 68% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of the croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00

The cost of the mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Applying the 10% discount: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00
The total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she has $6.00, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin will pay for 2 scoops. 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy, we can divide 4 scoops by 3.

4 scoops ÷ 3 scoops = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can buy 1 set of 3 scoops, she can buy 2 scoops for free. 

So, Erin should buy 2 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33. So, they ate 1.33 x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 of the total pizza. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5. So, they ate 1.5 x 60 = 90 slices.

In total, 80 + 90 = 170 slices were eaten. To find out how many slices were left, we subtract 170 from the total number of slices: 60 - 170 = -110. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this means that the initial calculation of 2/3 and ¾ is incorrect.

Let's recalculate the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, in total, they ate 3 x 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 of the total pizza. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5. So, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

In total, 24 + 18 = 42 slices were eaten. To find out how many slices were left, we subtract 42 from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time the cat takes. 

The cat takes 30 minutes, so 2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

The dog takes 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time the two take to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time the cat takes (30 minutes) and the time the dog takes (20 minutes), then divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches: 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe: 
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10 

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 5 students per group.

Now, we need to find the total number of groups needed. 
54 students / 5 students per group = 10.8 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 11 groups.

To find the number of groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed from the total number of groups required. 
12 groups (already formed) - 10 groups (required) = 2 groups.

Therefore, 2 more groups are needed to form."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months."
"To find out how many bananas Gunther found, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so Gunther had 48 / 2 = 24 bananas left.

Then, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

43"
"To find the monthly share of each roommate, we need to divide the total bill by the number of roommates. 

$100 (monthly bill) / 4 roommates = $25 per roommate per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly share.

$25 per month * 12 months = $300 per year

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates and then subtract the number of broken ones.

Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Total remaining: 86 + 42 = 128

The final answer is: 128"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and double the number of matches on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to first determine the number of votes against it. 

Let's assume the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2(11) = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of shirts for each size.

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts: 
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 60% of 40 people is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that 1/3 of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Let's set up an equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total, we can calculate it as follows:

"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially and then decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can divide 450 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

To find the total number of books read, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed: 450 + 225 = 675.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. 
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. 
$30 + $5 = $35

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: $135 - $60 = $75.

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25) to find out how much he should sell each ear for: $75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
   1/3 * 600 = 200 movies in series.

2. The cost of these series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

3. Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total:
   600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining.

4. Now, we need to find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
   40/100 * 400 = 160 older movies.

5. The cost of these older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

6. The cost of the remaining movies is 400 - 160 = 240 movies. Since a normal movie costs $10, the cost of these movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

7. The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score: 
- She collects 5 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 5 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 25 + 900 = 1825

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we'll ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange, but a mix of both colors. Let's say x orange fish were taken out, and (17 - x) white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) white fish. We are told that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 - x = -9 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

3 = -9 + 3x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, x = 4. This means that 4 orange fish were taken out, and (17 - 4) = 13 white fish were taken out.

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 13 white fish, Bob had 4 - 13 = -9 white fish (this is not possible, so we'll ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 13 white fish taken out were not all white, but a mix of both colors. Since we know that 4 orange fish were taken out, we can set up the equation:

3 + 4 = 2(4 - 13 + y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 = -8 + 2y

Add 8 to both sides:

15 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

7.5 = y

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this is not a valid solution.

However, we can re-evaluate the problem. We know that Bob had 3 orange fish initially, and he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say he has x orange fish now, and x/2 white fish. We know that x = 3 + y, where y is the number of orange fish taken out. We also know that x/2 = 4 - (17 - y). We can set up the equation:

x/2 = 4 - (17 - y)

Substitute x = 3 + y:

(3 + y)/2 = 4 - 17 + y

Multiply both sides by 2:

3 + y = 8 - 17 + 2y

Combine like terms:

3 + y = -9 + 2y

Subtract y from both sides:

3 = -9 + y

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = y

So, y = 12. This means that 12 orange fish were taken out, and (17 - 12) = 5 white fish were taken out.

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 5 white fish, Bob had 4 - 5 = -1 white fish (this is not possible, so we'll ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 5 white fish taken out were not all white, but a mix of both colors. Since we know that 12 orange fish were taken out, we can set up the equation:

3 + 12 = 2(4 - 5 + z)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 = -2 + 2z

Add 2 to both sides:

17 = 2z

Divide both sides by 2:

8.5 = z

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this is not a valid solution.

However, we can re-evaluate the problem. We know that Bob had 3 orange fish initially, and he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say he has x orange fish now, and x/2 white fish.

3 = -9 + y

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = y

So, y = 12. This means that 12 orange fish were taken out, and (17 - 12) = 5 white fish were taken out.

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 5 white fish, Bob had 4 - 5 = -1 white fish (this is not possible, so we'll ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 5 white fish taken out were not all white, but a mix of both colors. Since we know that 12 orange fish were taken out, we can set up the equation:

3 + 12 = 2(4 - 5 + z)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 = -2 + 2z

Add 2 to both sides:

17 = 2z

Divide both sides by 2:

8.5 = z

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this is not a valid solution.

However, we can re-evaluate the problem. We know that Bob had 3 orange fish initially, and he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say he has x orange fish now, and x/2 white fish. We know that x = 3 + y, where y is the number of orange fish taken out. We also know that x/2 = 4 - (17 - y). We can set up the equation:

x/2 = 4 - (17 - y)

Substitute x = 3 + y:

(3 + y)/2 = 4 - 17 + y

Multiply both sides by 2:

3 + y = 8 - 17 + 2y

Combine like terms:

3 + y = -9 + 2y

Subtract y from both sides:

3 = -9 + y

Add 9 to both sides:

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

The value of the quarters is 140 quarters * $0.25 = $35.

The value of the twenties she spent is 3/5 * 10 twenties = 6 twenties.
The value of 6 twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money she paid for lunch is $35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, Carson needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to the desired temperature."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, we can set up an equation to find the number of goats she needs:

Let x be the number of goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We want 30% of this total to be goats, so we can set up the equation:

0.30(14 + x) = x

To solve for x, we can start by distributing the 0.30:

4.2 + 0.30x = x

Now, we can subtract 0.30x from both sides:

4.2 = 0.70x

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.70:

6 = x

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth graders is twice the pass rate for fourth graders, it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
Third-graders: 340
Fourth-graders: 40
Fifth-graders: 2 * 80 = 160
Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 160 = 540

Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

The overall pass rate is 540/1000 = 0.54 or 54%.

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we need to first find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches in one bag: 
72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches per bag by 2: 
6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find out how many square inches he can make with 12 chips. 
12 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 1 square inch.

Since Milo can make 12 square inches with two bags, and he can make 1 square inch with 12 chips, we can multiply the number of square inches by the number of inches he wants his mosaic to be: 
12 * 3 = 36 inches.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores for each kid.

"To find out how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he needs 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person also needs 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so they play for 180 minutes. This person needs 180 / 20 = 9 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 6 + 9 = 27 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 27 * $0.25 = $6.75.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, and the amount of citrus zest as Z.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + O + F + Z = 10
2Z + 2S + Z + Z = 10
3Z + 2S + 2Z = 10
3Z + 2S + 2Z = 10
3(2Z) + 2S = 10
6Z + 2S = 10

Now, we can substitute S = 2Z into the equation:
6Z + 2(2Z) = 10
6Z + 4Z = 10
10Z = 10
Z = 1

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find S:
S = 2Z
S = 2(1)
S = 2

Now that we know S = 2, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(2)
O = 4

The final answer is: 4"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations ($50,000) from the total amount raised ($175,000). 

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we divide the remaining amount by 20 to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The answer is 6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first. 

She walked 8 hours on the first day. 
She walked half as many hours on the second day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 
8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars remaining, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"

6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 52."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color.

- Cindy had 5 green eggs.
- She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
- She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
- She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. 
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the information that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. We can set up a proportion to find the distance.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 kangaroos * 18 hours
Distance = 54 hours

Now we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 54 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 13.5 hours

The final answer is: 13.5"

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $50, so we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we can divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find out how much milk one cow produces per day. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow per day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. 

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs. 

15 - 3 = 12

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the length of the glue sticks that are used. 
The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since we can't have negative length, we need to recheck our calculations.

Let's recheck the calculations:
The first glue stick has 5/6 left, so it has 1/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the length of the glue sticks that are used. 
The first glue stick is 1/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/6) * 12 = 2 millimeters.
The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 12 = 0 millimeters.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M from the previous steps into the equation:

(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:

5B = 95

Divide by 5:

B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:

A = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.
Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.
Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total.

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips.
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.
Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we add their individual tips:
$720 (Julieta) + $800 (Rafaela) = $1520.

The final answer is: 1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer had 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber earns twice as many badges as Claire, so she earns 2 * 12 = 24 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges: 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked in 5 hours. 

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, she bakes 2 * 8 = 16 slices per hour. 

In 5 hours, she bakes 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 50 cents is 0.5 dollars. 

To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The total amount raised is 40 dollars."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 
So, Gretchen had 40 silver coins. 
To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Then, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

So, there were 480 burritos leftover from the picnic.

480"
"To find the number of green cars, we know that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

We also know that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52

75 (total) - 52 = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. 

Let's say Fawn has x books. 
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends per month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to get the weekly cost. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days.
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, we add the pieces he ate each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is 48."

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias will sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell these chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he wants to make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we can divide the total amount he needs to make ($11000) by the number of chickens he plans to sell (180) to find out how much he bought each chicken for:

$11000 / 180 chickens = $61.11 per chicken

"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33."

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount of money she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost of the new rope is:
$1.5 * 20 = $30

Sarah's friend is selling the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total amount of money she will get from selling the rope is:
$2 * 20 = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount of money she will get from selling the rope:
$40 - $30 = $10

"To find Melanie's present age, we need to subtract 10 years from her age in 10 years. 

Melanie's age in 10 years = 18
Melanie's present age = 18 - 10 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's assume her age in x years will be 3 times her present age. 

3 * 8 = 24
x = 24

Since x is the number of years from now, we need to subtract 8 (her present age) from 24 to get the number of years from now.

x - 8 = 24 - 8
x - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Whatchamacallit speed = 11 * Thingamabob speed

We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

121 = 11 * Thingamabob speed

To find the thingamabob speed, we can divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob speed, we can find the whirligig speed by multiplying it by 5:

Whirligig speed = 5 * Thingamabob speed
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find the cost of the yogurt, we need to know its price. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 for her daily goods. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost to find the cost of the carrots. $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day.

"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x.

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts from each lawn: 6x + 3x + 5x = 14x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation 14x = 80 and solve for x.

14x = 80
x = 80 / 14
x = 5.71 (round down to 5, since you can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time)

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns: 6x + 3x + 5x = 6(5) + 3(5) + 5(5) = 30 + 15 + 25 = 70.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, and Calvin is an adult, we can assume that the pot can fill 4 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 + 2 = 6 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 bowls, and there are 6 people, there will be 2 bowls of soup left over. 

Now, we need to divide the leftover soup by the number of child's bowls the pot can fill, which is 8. 

2 bowls / 8 bowls = 0.25 

Since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can round down to 0. However, in this context, it's more logical to say that each child can have 1 bowl of soup for lunch, and the remaining 2 bowls can be saved for another meal or used for something else."

So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from 18. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books.

16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate 1/5 of 30.

1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6

Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 to Donald, so he gives away a total of 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially.

30 - 16 = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation: 
   Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
   60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
   52 = 2x - 8

2. Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
   52 + 8 = 2x
   60 = 2x

3. Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
   x = 60 / 2
   x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

4. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to calculate the acres of each farm and add them together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, so it is 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

The total number of acres is 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

64"
"To find the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for both normal and extreme sudoku.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles of water: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons. 

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

Let's say the number of yellow balloons is x. Then, the total number of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 3x. 

We know that the total number of bologna thrown is 58, and 2 pieces were thrown at each red balloon. So, the total number of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 3x + 40 = 58. 

Solving for x, we get: 
3x = 58 - 40
3x = 18
x = 18 / 3
x = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 per 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. So, the cost of the balloons is 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) = $14.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $14 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can say that the total amount they had initially is also $28. 

To find out how much their mother gave each of them, we divide the total amount by 2. 

$28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold, the total cost of the lollipops, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Total number of lollipops bought * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

So, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips to get 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water first. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:
5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since we don't know the exact number of days left in the month, we'll assume it's a 30-day month for simplicity. 

There are 5 Fridays and 5 Saturdays, so Colby has already seen 10 movies. There are 15 days left in the month (30 - 10 - 5 = 15). 

Colby can see 15 / 10 = 1.5 movies on the remaining days. Since you can't see half a movie, we'll round down to 1 movie.

Colby can see 1 more movie on the remaining days.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156
Total Junebugs removed on Thursday and Friday = 48 + 57 = 105
Total Junebugs removed in 5 days = 39 + 156 + 105 = 300

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total, including Maria, the additional balloons would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons to the additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the price James paid for the CDs is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how far James swims in the first part of his journey. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate it as follows:
   60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

2. Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to swim 12 miles:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
   Time = 6 hours

3. After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:
   Rest time = 6 hours / 2
   Rest time = 3 hours

4. Now, James has to swim the remaining distance, which is:
   Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
   Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
   Remaining distance = 8 miles

5. Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:
   New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
   New speed = 1 mile per hour

6. Now, we can find the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
   Time = 8 hours

7. Finally, we add up the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming again to find the total time:
   Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
   Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
   Total time = 17 hours

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's denote Dinar's score as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's score is x + 10. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's score is (x + 10) - 20. 

We also know that the total score is 45 points. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x - 0 = 45.

Add 0 to both sides: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's score: Azibo's score = (15 + 10) - 20 = 5.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we need to subtract 5 minutes from the usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so 5 minutes earlier would be 5:55 a.m. 

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours, and 12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes. 

2 hours * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
5 hours * 60 minutes = 300 minutes
Adding the 55 minutes, we get 120 + 300 + 55 = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep while sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's add the time she was asleep while sleepwalking to the total time she was asleep. 
475 minutes + 23 minutes = 498 minutes

The final answer is: 498"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan also has 24 measuring cups. So, the total number of utensils he has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils.

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
100 + (50 * 14) = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 800 = 200

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails per day = 16
   Work emails = 7
   Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   Non-work emails = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails = 9

2. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to family.
   Emails to family = 2/3 * Non-work emails
   Emails to family = 2/3 * 9
   Emails to family = 6

3. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 * Non-work emails
   Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 * 9
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3. 
Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the original number and subtract it from the original number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day, we add the holes dug each day: 
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we multiply the number of holes at the end of the first day by 4:
31 * 4 = 124 holes.

Now, we subtract the holes dug on the first three days (31) from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:
124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
2. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)
3. X + S + A = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokémon)

We can substitute the value of X from equation 1 into equation 3:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 2 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at her office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows: 
13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 
13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

There are 33 players in both teams combined.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The total number of wooden slats Robert will need is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 4 boxes.

4 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total to find out how many she sold.

240 - 80 (given away) - 60 (kept) = 100 oranges

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29.

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much Tyler needs to earn, we need to add up the cost of the books and subtract the amount he already has.

Cost of books = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and we have already accounted for 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the total number of cherries accounted for from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday, we need to follow the information given:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $90 + $90 = $240

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne had, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we need to find the average of 5 (Sophie's size) and 25 (Charlie's size). 

Average = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between each plant (1.5 feet or 18 inches) from the total length of the bed. 
1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can fit:
1314 / 12 = 109.5 plants

However, since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
109 - 17 = 92 more flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:
92 * 6 = $552

The final answer is: 552"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we multiply 18 by 1/2 to get 9 pretzels per day for Edgar's brother.

Now, we need to multiply 9 pretzels per day by 7 days in a week to get the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. 

9 pretzels per day * 7 days per week = 63 pretzels per week.

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

Cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 - $500 = $1,500 per month for other expenses

There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide $1,500 by 12 to find out how much she can spend on shoes per month.

$1,500 / 12 = $125 per month

Now, we can divide the amount she can spend on shoes per month by the cost of each pair to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year.

$125 / $1,000 = 0.125 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

0.125 * 12 = 1.5 pairs per year

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we can round down to 1 pair per year.

Jessica can buy 1 pair of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total cooling effect plus the warming effect:
Final temperature = Starting temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
Final temperature = Starting temperature - 14 degrees

Since we don't know the starting temperature, we can represent the final temperature as a difference from the starting temperature. The air conditioner cooled the room by 14 degrees, and the room warmed up by 4 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 - 4 = 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation:

x = 3 * 30
x = 90

So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."

4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can now write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.
8. Solving for W, we get: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount Walter has collected.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This means that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount Walter has collected.

So, we can assume that Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the amount Walter has collected so far, which is $2000. 

$2000 * 3 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate 1/2 of 100 guests multiplied by 15 cookies per guest.

1/2 of 100 guests = 50 guests
50 guests * 15 cookies = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices. 

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's assume the kid's slice is x. Then, the adult's slice is 2x.

Since the total number of slices is 6, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x + x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 6x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms again: 8x = 6

Divide both sides by 8: x = 6/8 = 0.75

So, the kid's slice is 0.75 units, and the adult's slice is 2x = 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the adult's slice by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(1.5 / 6) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time. The cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, so we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. 
To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons, which is $300 + $180 = $480.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61916 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61916 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6191.60

The final answer is: $6191.60"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.
Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow)
Total number of sticks = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The difference in distance traveled is 230 miles."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. 
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

To find the number of female students over 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16. 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16. 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 years old to find the total number of female students. 
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's recheck the calculations.

Let's recheck the first 5 hours:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge cannot be negative, so let's recheck the initial charge. Let's assume the initial charge is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% * 5) = x - 45%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - 45% - (7% * 3) = x - 45% - 21% = x - 66%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:
x - 66% = 28%
x = 94%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how much Janet needs for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide the total hours by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. 
Total number of sweets = 15 * 60 = 900

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends = 15 - 2 = 13

Since she gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10.
Number of sweets each friend received = 900 / 10 = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 = 27 points."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total revenue from large stuffed animals. Let's say Teresa sold L large stuffed animals. Then, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 12L.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals is 2L.

The total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2L * (x/3) = 2L * (12/3) = 8L.

We know that the total revenue from both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12L + 8L = 120

Combine like terms:

20L = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

L = 6

Since L represents the number of large stuffed animals, we know that Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2L = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by 30.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Now, we multiply this by 30 days to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Ted spent 66 dollars in total."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 
40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack to find the number of packs:
80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese: 2 pounds * $11 per pound = $22
Mozzarella cheese: 3 pounds * $6 per pound = $18

Total cost of cheese: $22 + $18 = $40

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income Jim had before college.

Total money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how much he earns per year after college, we need to add the money he earns from his job and the money he earns from his degree.

New income per year = $75,000 (from the degree) + $25,000 (from his job) = $100,000 per year

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take for Jim to pay off the loans. 

Total amount to pay off = $100,000 (lost) + $50,000 (loans) = $150,000

Number of years to pay off the loans = Total amount to pay off / New income per year
= $150,000 / $100,000
= 1.5 years

Since Jim didn't work during the 4 years he was in school, we need to add those 4 years to the 1.5 years it takes to pay off the loans.

Total years to earn back the money = 4 years (lost) + 1.5 years (to pay off the loans)
= 5.5 years

The final answer is: 5.5"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the fabric will be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.

The area of the fabric is calculated by multiplying the length by the width: 
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the total amount lost, we need to calculate the amount won and lost in each race.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he lost $5 initially, and then won $2 * $5 = $10. 
The net loss in the second race is $10 - $5 = $5.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
He won $10 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $10 = $15 in the third race.

The total amount lost is $5 (first race) + $5 (second race) + $15 (third race) = $25.

To find the average loss, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $25 / 3 = $8.33.

The final answer is 8.33."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000 = 13000

The final answer is: 13000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So, the first person took $420.

420"
"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours worked per day by 7 (the number of days in a week): 9 hours/day * 7 days/week = 63 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters: 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours per painter.

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of books written in English and German.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.
Number of Spanish books = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20

The number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 / 16 = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. Total = 120 + 20 = 140
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. Total = 140 + 100 = 240
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. Total = 240 - 80 = 160

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. 

Since each tile is 1ft in length and the floor area is 200 SqFt, we can fit 200 tiles in the floor. 

Now, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile: 
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

$192 * 12 = $2304

James pays $2304 a year."
"To find the total number of loads, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

For twin beds: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads
For king bed: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we need to divide the total number of loads by 3 to find the number of loads per week.

Twin loads per week: 208 / 3 = 69.33 (round up to 70 since you can't do a fraction of a load)
King loads per week: 52 / 3 = 17.33 (round up to 18 since you can't do a fraction of a load)

Total loads per week: 70 + 18 = 88 loads

Now, multiply the total loads per week by 52 weeks in a year: 88 * 52 = 4560 loads

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's slices: 
10 - 3 = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find Silvia's slices:
7 * 2 = 14

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by each person:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices eaten is 31.

"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit cost is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the visit cost is $300 / 2 = $150.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he can buy, we divide the total pounds of butter he needs (6) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00 and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00."

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

Jenny paid with 5 $5 bills, which is 5 * 5 = $25. 

The change she should get is $25 - $18.75 = $6.25. 

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 6 dollars is 6 * 4 = 24 quarters. 

For the remaining 0.25 dollars, we need 1 quarter. 

So, Jenny leaves with 24 + 1 = 25 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, and the fourth train departs at 145 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we multiply 2000 by 0.75 to get the sale price: 
2000 * 0.75 = 1500

Now, we need to find the original price. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation: 
Original price * 0.75 = 1500
Original price = 1500 / 0.75
Original price = 2000

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
120% of 1500 is 1500 * 1.2 = 1800

The original price was 2000, and Mr. Rogers sold it to his friend for 1800. To find the discount percentage, we subtract the sale price from the original price and divide by the original price:
Discount = (2000 - 1800) / 2000
Discount = 200 / 2000
Discount = 0.1
Discount percentage = 0.1 * 100
Discount percentage = 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can calculate the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is 60 * 60 * 4 = 1440 seconds.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours is 1440.

Now, since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 5 * 1440 = 7200.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 7200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total time is twice the time it took him to walk to the store.

Total time = 2 * 0.5 hours
Total time = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of $500): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 days a week, and each class is 40 minutes long. 
5 days * 40 minutes = 200 minutes per week

He also spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. 
Since there are 1680 minutes in a week, 
1/16 * 1680 = 105 minutes

Total minutes spent in class and extra learning time per week = 200 + 105 = 305 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
305 minutes / 60 = 5.0833 hours

The final answer is 5.0833."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the velociraptors ate 270 kilograms, which is half of the remaining meat. 

To find the total amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate, we need to multiply 270 by 2 (since the velociraptors ate half of it). 
270 * 2 = 540 kilograms

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the original amount. To find the original amount, we need to multiply 540 by 2.
540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend can get sprayed with soda from this shaken can. 

There are 12 sodas in total, and 11 sodas are left (12 - 1 unshaken soda taken by Ellen and 1 shaken soda taken by Ellen's brother). 

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

The likelihood = (1 shaken soda / 11 sodas) * 100 = 9.09%

The final answer is 9.09."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and the number of people he can help per day.

Billy is available to work for 31 days in March, but he takes 20% of the days off. 
20% of 31 days is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to work for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. 
So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he is available to work: 
6 people/day * 25 days = 150 people.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes first.

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes per day, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
So, his total daily time spent on lunch and breaks is: 
30 minutes (lunch) + 2 * 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby does this for 5 days, we multiply the total daily time by 5:
1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance covered by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distances covered by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00. The new price of the frying pan is $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. The new price of the towels is $27.00.

Now, we add the new prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Lauren saves $20,000 per year and spends $40,000 per year. This means she is in a deficit of $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate how much she needs to save in total.

Total savings needed for 20 years = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total savings needed by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work.

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $400,000 / $20,000
= 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save for the retirement period, not the number of years she needs to work to save for the retirement period and live on 40% of her current salary. 

Since she needs 20 years to save for the retirement period, and she will live on 40% of her current salary for 20 years, we can assume she will need to work for 20 years to save for the retirement period and live on 40% of her current salary.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total population of the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys in the school.

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can divide the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of the percentage of boys: 
240 / 0.4 = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But this is not possible since she has $2 left. This means the initial $4 she spent was not the money she spent on the books. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. She then spent $2 on the books, leaving her with $12 - $2 = $10. Since she has $2 left, it means she actually spent $10 - $2 = $8 on the books. 

Since she bought 2 books for $8, we can divide $8 by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$8 ÷ 2 = $4

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the 5th worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris received 7 stickers from Luis and kept 9 stickers. So, the total number of stickers Kris received from Luis is 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Since Kris received half of the stickers from Luis, the total number of stickers Luis received is 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Luis received half of the stickers from Seth, so the total number of stickers Seth had initially is 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the 2nd fastest car's speed is 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the faster car's speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The faster car goes 750 Miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons since they are the same weight, so the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

Total weight of crayons and boxes = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 + 12.5
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie and her brother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns twice as much as her, so her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Now, we add their salaries together: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15,000 * 2 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add their salaries together: $15,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $45,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and then add it to the time spent on the beach.

First, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, she spends half the time on the sidewalk compared to the beach. 

Time spent on the beach = 40 minutes
Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 / 2 = 20 minutes

Total time spent on the sidewalk = 20 minutes
Total time spent on the beach = 40 minutes
Total time spent on the entire walk = 20 + 40 = 60 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has saved from the total amount she wants to save: 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take: 28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny starts with 2 mugs of water. Since we don't know the temperature of the second mug, let's represent it as 'x'. 

The total amount of water Donny has after pouring is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug. 

So, the total amount of water Donny has is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water now, the temperature of the remaining water in both mugs must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is 'x'. The amount of water in the 33-degree mug is 33 - 4 = 29 ounces. 

The amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce. 

The total amount of water in both mugs is 5 ounces. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the amount of water in the second mug (1 ounce) plus the amount of water in the 33-degree mug (29 ounces) should be equal to 5 ounces. 

However, this is not possible since 29 ounces is more than 5 ounces. This means our assumption that the second mug has 1 ounce of water is incorrect.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks will have 21 days (3 * 7).

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the total cost of the bagels, first, calculate the total number of bagels. 
4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels

The total cost of the bagels without the discount is 36 bagels * $10.00 per bagel = $360.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, calculate the discount amount:
$360.00 * 10% = $360.00 * 0.10 = $36.00

The total cost after the discount is $360.00 - $36.00 = $324.00

To find the cost of each bagel, divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
$324.00 / 36 bagels = $9.00 per bagel

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of non-blue jellybeans. 

We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of non-blue jellybeans is 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 / 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam invests $100, and each rock costs $5, so the total number of rocks he can buy is:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory:
60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks
Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost and the loss:
Total cost = 20 rocks * $5 = $100
Total revenue = $84
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue = $100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the maximum number of days among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days

For small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

The maximum number of days is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project."
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs to a numerical value. One dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, the total cost for one fish in May would be 31 * $1 = $31.

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all the fish in May would be 3 * $31 = $93.

The final answer is 93."

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 
27 - 5 = 22

Now, we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, we can divide 22 by 2 to find out how many Carrey collected.
22 / 2 = 11

Now that we know how many seashells each person initially collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells.
27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally between themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got.
60 / 3 = 20

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices = 6 * $40 = $240

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost.
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $240 - $120
= $120

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the maximum number of bottles they can produce and then calculate the difference.

The maximum number of bottles Hortex can produce is 4200. 

Let's recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 4200 * (2300 * 0.2) / 2300

x = 4200 * 0.2

x = 840

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 840 - 4200 = -3360

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 4200 * (2300 * 0.2) / 2300

x = 4200 * 0.2

x = 840

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, and the total demand is 840 bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

4200 (current production) - 840 (total demand) = 3360

The final answer is 3360."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2
Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (6 + 2) = 1/3 * 8 = 8/3 = 2.67 (round down to 2 since we can't have a fraction of a baby)

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (Number of babies wearing purple and bows) / (Total number of babies wearing bows)
Probability = 2 / 2.67 ≈ 0.75 or 75%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from selling his land.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He received $50 for this sale.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. He received $30 for this sale.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he received 20 * $3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 in total.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Since the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, we can write the equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she was left with 15 - x, where x is the amount she gave away. We know that she was left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So Rissa gave away $3. 

Now, we know that Rissa was left with 12 dollars. Since she gave away $3, she had 15 - 3 = 12 dollars initially. 

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave away $3. 

Ronnie was given $5 initially, so she has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + x = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, the amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3 pints each.

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we can divide the budget of $1 by the cost of one pod to find the number of cycles:

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12 (cost of one pod)

= 8.33

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

2.25 = 0.20 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.25 / 0.20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Newton initially picked up 2 apples.
2. He put 1 in his pocket and threw 1 into the tree, causing 5 more to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these apples in his pocket, leaving 6 apples. He threw 1 apple back into the tree, causing 6 more to fall out. So, he now has 6 (remaining) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.
4. Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each type of pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

So, they ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

So, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. 
Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding this to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."

"To find the total cost, we need to first find the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60 trees.
The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'x'. 

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left. 

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done, the total time required will be the time for the 3 full groups plus the waiting time for the remaining 6 students.

The waiting time for the remaining 6 students is 45 minutes (since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done). 

So, the total time required is:

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

The sum of the scores is: 
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 550

There are 9 scores in total. 

Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
550 / 9 = 61.11

The mean score is 61.11."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to calculate 3/4 of the original amount, since she is left with 1/4.

3/4 of 20 is (3/4) * 20 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

15"
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. The remaining number of apples is 60 - 24 = 36.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 * 0.25 = 9

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. The remaining number of apples is 36 - 9 = 27.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters is the same as 3/4.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, and he traveled for 3 days, the total hours traveled is 24 * 3 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply the total hours by his average speed: 72 hours * 50 km/hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100: (3600 / 6000) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers and the number of substitute teachers.

There were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many books each shelf can hold, we need to start from the bottom shelf. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we know that the total number of books is 110. We can add up the number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total books so far: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since we still have 110 - 45 = 65 books left, we need to add another shelf. Since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, we need 65 / 10 = 6.5 shelves. However, we can't have a fraction of a shelf, so we need 7 shelves in total.

The answer is 7."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozens
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total revenue = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per sale = 20 sales
Total revenue = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 hats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 hats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 hats.

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents per stick.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can write an equation:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can write another equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make, we need to break down the process into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to get 15 customers, he would need to make 15 * 25 = 375 telephone calls.

However, for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason would need 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

Since Jason gets 1 customer for every 25 calls, to get 30 customers, he would need 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

750"
"To find the total number of flashlights, we need to multiply the number of people by 2, since each person has a flashlight. 
8 people * 2 flashlights/person = 16 flashlights

Since there are 4 rooms with 2 flashlights each, we multiply the number of rooms by 2.
4 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 8 flashlights

There are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each. 
4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
Total candles = 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together.
16 flashlights + 36 candles = 52

The final answer is: 52"

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
- The total time for the first 5 sides is 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

Since the last side takes the same amount of time as the first side, the total time for the Rubik's cube is 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

"To find the total number of items, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
Robots = (1/2) * 20
Robots = 10

Now we have the number of robots (10), helmets (20), and footballs (40). To find the total number of items, we add them together:
Total items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total items = 70

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total minutes he spends on calls per day. 

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, we multiply the daily minutes by 5:

360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent on land and the time spent in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop, so 60 kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 170

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
1 gallon = 4 cups
So, 1 gallon requires 6 lemons/cup * 4 cups = 24 lemons

Now, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for 5 gallons:
24 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 120 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice:
2 * 1 cup = 2 cups
2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
120 lemons + 12 lemons = 132 lemons

"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the age of Emma, we need to add 16 to Mia's age. 

Mia's age: 40
Emma's age: 40 + 16 = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

= 96 / 2
= 48

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Total seashells = 214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Number of cracked seashells = 67

Number of good seashells = Total seashells - Number of cracked seashells
= 732 - 67

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours. 

Then, we add 2 hours to that result, which is 5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The answer is 20."
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs the guests will eat and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

The cost of hot dogs: 8 packs * $2 per pack = $16"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

Total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40
Total income from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40
Total income: $40 + $40 = $80

Total cost of trays: 5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Total expenses: $20

$80 - $20 = $60

Frances has $60 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10 * 2 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years
- 3 sisters: 16 years each

Total age of the siblings = 12 + 24 + (3 * 16)

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga per week is 300 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 
30 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 330 minutes per week.

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 330 * 4 = 1320 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60: 1320 / 60 = 22 hours.

For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we can convert the dozen to a numerical value: 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5: 36 * 0.5 = 18.

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original number of seeds in the small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we know Timothy has 54 pens. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2 to find Sarah's pens.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"" tall.

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall.

We know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height. 

Jackie's height before the summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67"""
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4
- The price of the second T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- Jake buys the shoes at 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16
- The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week and did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
- Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, so B = 7.

Now, we know that the total number of items on the lab bench is 29. We can write an equation to represent this:
T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know:
8 + 7 + 16 = 29

This equation is true, so we don't need to do anything else. However, we want to find out how many beakers Igor lost. We know that he had 7 beakers and the total number of items on the bench is 29. 

To find the number of beakers Igor lost, we subtract the total number of items on the bench from the total number of items he gathered:
7 (initial beakers) + x (beakers lost) = 29
7 + x = 29
x = 22

So, Igor lost 22 beakers."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = (x/2) * time

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = x * 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 4 / 16
x = 1/4 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's speed = x/2 = (1/4) / 2 = 1/8 miles per minute

Time = distance / speed
Time = 4 / (1/8)
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes
