"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fibers: 2 bolts
White fibers: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given to the chickens.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives 3 meals a day, and she has already given 2 meals, she needs to give the remaining 1 meal.

Total feed needed for the final meal = Total feed given so far
Total feed needed for the final meal = 800 cups

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. This takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 40 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes + 40 minutes = 80 minutes.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts:

1. The first 3 hours at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. The 2 hours of standstill traffic:
Since he didn't move, the distance is 0 miles.

3. The 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. The remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

So, John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0.

Year 1: Net profit = $7.50
Year 2: Net profit = $7.50 + $7.50 = $15
Year 3: Net profit = $15 + $7.50 = $22.50

It will take 2 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential profit: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
Total value: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential profit: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
Total value: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the total value of the jewelry ($5,125) is greater than the total value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

Profit = Total value of chosen item - Initial cost
Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. 

On the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to complete the 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to complete the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 8 miles per hour

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the 24 liters of pineapple drink. Since the total amount is 24 liters, we can convert 46/3 to a decimal: 46/3 ≈ 15.33 liters.

Now, we add 15.33 liters to 24 liters: 15.33 + 24 = 39.33 liters.

The final answer is: 39.33"
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when his son was born. Since Raymond was 23 years old when his son was born, and we know Samantha is 31 years old now, we can find Raymond's current age by subtracting 6 years from Samantha's age.

Raymond's current age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's current age = 31 - 6
Raymond's current age = 25

Now, we can find the number of years ago Raymond's son was born by subtracting his age at the time of birth from his current age.

Years ago Raymond's son was born = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at the time of birth
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 25 - 23
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 2

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need: 
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 * $4.00 = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.
The distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 60 - (60 - 15) = 15 miles.

Now, we add the two distances together: 40 + 15 = 55 miles.

Henry traveled 55 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: 94"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms: 18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages:
Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate each person's guess and then find the average.

The first person says 80 jelly beans.
The second person says 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person says 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these three guesses. To do this, we add the guesses together and divide by 3.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. We can do this by dividing the cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we can multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his 13 lego sets. 

13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He spent $20 each on 8 video games, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * $20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on the video games and the money left.

$195 - $160 (video games) - $5 (remaining money) = $30

This means he spent $30 on the video games and the money left. Since he spent $30, we need to subtract this from the initial amount to find out how much he had initially.

$195 - $30 = $165

Now, we know John initially had $165. To find out how many lego sets he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount.

$165 - $195 = -$30 (this is incorrect, as he can't have a negative number of lego sets)

This means he actually spent more than he had. Since he had $165 and spent $195, he must have had more than $195 initially. However, we are given that he had 13 lego sets and sold them for $15 each. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If he had more than $195 initially, he would have had more than 13 lego sets. However, we are given that he had 13 lego sets. 

Since he spent $195, which is more than the initial amount, we can assume that he actually had more than 13 lego sets. However, we can still find the number of lego sets he has left by subtracting the amount he spent from the amount he got from selling the lego sets.

$195 - $30 (the amount he spent on the video games) = $165

Since he got $165 from selling the lego sets, we can divide this amount by the price per lego set ($15) to find out how many lego sets he sold.

$165 / $15 = 11

Since he initially had 13 lego sets and sold 11, we subtract the number of lego sets he sold from the initial number to find out how many lego sets he has left.

13 - 11 = 2

John has 2 lego sets left."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours per week.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings: 300g / 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48g.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, net profit = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

The net profit is -$160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice initially had, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

80 + 220 = 300

However, she had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she initially had is 300 + 23 = 323.

Now, we need to find out how many notes were in the package she purchased. We know that she initially had 323 notes and used 300 notes. 

323 - 300 = 23

The package she purchased contained 23 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

40 * 1.5 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:

200 + 600 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of units in the building. 

First, we find the total number of units: 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units.

Then, we calculate 3/4 of the total units: 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

Since the remaining units are unoccupied, we subtract the occupied units from the total units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags.

28"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid.
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = approximately 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

For the adults, since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, the total amount needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

For the children, each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. Since there are 5 children, the total amount needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as x. Then, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
x = 36

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his improved time. Since his speed improved by 10%, we can multiply his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement):
Gerald's improved time = 1.1 * 36
Gerald's improved time = 39.6

The final answer is 39.6."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

32 ounces / 2 = 16 ounces of tomatoes

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces and 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

16 ounces / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes

So, Freda used 5.33 tomatoes.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, and there were originally 30 cars. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

He has 4 more days to complete the remaining pages. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 1 * 5 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water per day, so the total number of glasses of water on weekends is 2.

Now, let's add the total number of glasses of water on weekdays and weekends: 5 + 2 = 7.

Therefore, John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract it from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days and subtract that from the total time he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time watched on other days from the total time: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 to find the number of episodes: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."

For Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten:
90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, we multiply 3 sets by 2 liters per set to get 6 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many birds are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of each board is 1.5 times the original price. 
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $10 = $15 per board.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $16 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to calculate 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago and subtract it from Adrien's salary.

Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
30% of Adrien's salary four years ago = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago - 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40% from four years ago, we can calculate it as follows:

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
= $40,000 + 0.4 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000

Now, we can find Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% of her salary four years ago to her salary four years ago:

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
= $28,000 + 0.4 * $28,000
= $28,000 + $11,200

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate the number of letters she stamped by dividing the total number of letters needing stamps by 3. 

60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. 

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, there were 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile, we need to add the number of letters Jennie stamped to the number of letters in the pile after stamping.

30 (already-stamped letters) + 20 (stamped letters) = 50

Therefore, there were 50 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12.

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and doctors.

Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total revenue from doctors:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Total revenue: $100,000 (from patients) + $30,000 (from doctors) = $130,000

Total cost: Since we don't have the cost of the hospital, we'll assume it's negligible for this calculation.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, and there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can start by finding the number of queens. 

Let's assume the number of queens is Q. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. The sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the tax on non-food items first. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

The tax on these items is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the food items plus the cost of the non-food items with tax: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. He has 3 clients, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, he will need 3 * 2 = 6 bottles of bleach and 3 packs of cloths.

The total cost of bleach will be 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of cloths will be 3 * $5 = $15.

The total expenses will be $12 + $15 = $27.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $27 = $65.

The final answer is 65."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours (which is 30) fly from the hive and leave, which is 60 bees.
4. Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. We know 30 bees left initially and 15 bees returned, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees hadn't returned yet.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

Therefore, Debra saw 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can find out how much she gave the cashier by adding the change to the total cost of the tickets. 

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

We know that there were 5 fries left after the ants took one. So, before the ants took one, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon took some 'x'. Then, the raccoon took 2/3 * x fries. So, the remaining fries are 1/3 * x. We know that 1/3 * x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 18.

Now, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So, before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

A seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. Let's call the number of fries Dave ate 'y'. Then, the seagull ate y/2 fries. So, the remaining fries are y - y/2 = y/2. We know that y/2 = 27. Solving for y, we get y = 54.

So, Dave ate 54 fries initially.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

The rolls are 4 inches long, and there are 300 of them. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The chocolate croissants are 6 inches long, and there are 120 of them. We can convert the length of the croissants to feet by dividing by 12:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are 2 feet long, and there are 60 of them. Since they are already in feet, we don't need to convert them:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet.

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire 100 yards 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards per trip. She does this 34 times.
80 yards * 34 trips = 2720 yards

Since 2720 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 1220 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3, which is (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of an action figure as follows:
3 action figures = 1 doll
3 action figures = 1 red car
1 action figure = 1/3 of a red car
1 action figure = 1/3 * $4 = $1.33

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each toy:
- 5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20

- 1 doll = 1 * $4 = $4

The total cost of all toys is $20 + $4 + $4 = $28."
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age: S = 2B = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

Time to peel 60 potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes
Time to cut 60 potatoes: 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds

Converting 300 seconds to minutes: 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members: 160 - 60 = 100.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.
4. The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.
5. The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.
7. The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.
8. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given away is 200 + 700 = 900$.
9. The amount left after giving to his family is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80
= 3 * 20
= 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of rolling 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2 = 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more than the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25."
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide her mom's apples by 2, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The answer is 30."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since the straw is distributed equally among the rats, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 (the number of straw pieces per rat): 90 / 6 = 15

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the cost of transportation:
Total cost = Total cost + Cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, we know the total cost and the total revenue. We can set up an equation to find the number of bags:
Total revenue = Total cost
$400 = $286 + (Number of bags - 13) * $2

Simplifying the equation:
$400 = $286 + 2 * Number of bags - $26
$400 = $260 + 2 * Number of bags
$400 - $260 = 2 * Number of bags
$140 = 2 * Number of bags
Number of bags = $140 / 2
Number of bags = 70

However, we already know that the trader sold 13 bags. The correct number of bags is indeed 13."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years: 
10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees a year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted: 
100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3: 
80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had after planting and chopping: 
80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The answer is 56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted them white and put them back out, so now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink plastic flamingos, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.

Since there are 6 white flamingos, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, since he edits an equal number for both publishers. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award:
He makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:
$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the award amount of $5000 to his total earnings:
$104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

Since he received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the 5% raise on his new salary, which is $105,000. To calculate the raise amount:
$105,000 * 5% = $105,000 * 0.05 = $5250

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   The cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she needs to earn $60 in total and can earn $5 per babysitting session, she can earn the remaining amount ($60 - $60 = $0) by mowing the lawn. However, she needs to earn $60 in total, so she will need to mow the lawn 15 times.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:
3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:
8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:
8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:
r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find out how many customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4x = 4(x - 16). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4x - 64. Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get 0 = -64. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago is incorrect.

However, let's re-evaluate the situation. If the big pool had four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation: 4x = 4(x + 16). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4x + 64. Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get 0 = 64. This is also a contradiction.

However, let's re-evaluate the situation again. If the big pool had four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation: 4x = 4(x + 16). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4x + 64. Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get 0 = 64. This is also a contradiction.

Let's try again. If the big pool had four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation: 4x = 4(x + 16). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4x + 64. Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get 0 = 64. This is also a contradiction.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total amount she needs is the cost of the shoes and the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of the initial $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay back is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since Janeth will be paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance:

$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (total paid) = $220

Janeth's remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses in the vase. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias in the vase.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on Harriet's age.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the four students: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately.

Time spent on crossword puzzles: 3 puzzles * 10 minutes per puzzle = 30 minutes

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

Number of geraniums: 90

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. 
A third of that amount is 15000 / 3 = 5000. 
So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years: 
15000 + 5000 = 20000.

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos' cost: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

"To find the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. 
The car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96 = 0.3333.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%."
"To find the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat is $2.00.
Extra cheese is $1.00.
Avocado is $1.00.
2 sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The upgrade is $3.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: 
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for 12 cars is 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

The total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to know that there are half as many bugs as ants. Since there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of bugs and ants together:

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave.

So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the snow.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced per vine.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since there are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is 20 * 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we need to divide 80 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order. 

80 / 8 = 10

John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has: 
54 / 2 = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's amount:
27 + 6 = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:
54 - 33 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of minutes in a week by the number of minutes it takes him to write one page to find out how many hours he spends writing per week. 

420 minutes / 6 minutes per page = 70 pages per week
70 pages / 5 pages per letter = 14 letters per week
14 letters / 2 letters per week = 7 letters per week

Now, we can calculate the total hours he spends writing per week. 

7 letters per week * 5 pages per letter = 35 pages per week
35 pages per week / 5 pages per hour = 7 hours per week

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used and the extra minutes from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for 'x', we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first find the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the cost per pound.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Calories difference = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can find the total number of students in the school:
Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class
= 30 students

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is:
15 + 12 = 27 girls

Now, we can find the number of girls in the third class:
Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - Total number of girls in the first two classes
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls, so the third class must have 3 girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - Number of girls in the first two classes
= 30 - 27
= 3 boys

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of cows in each stall becomes 20 + 40/20 = 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

Now, we need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Since there are 22 cows in each stall, we multiply 22 by 8 to get the total number of cows in 8 stalls.

22 * 8 = 176

The final answer is 176."

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to 44:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing 48 by 2:
48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:
52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 44 (Jamal's apples) = 144

The total number of fruits is 144."
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12 (since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies).

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we'll divide the total number of cookies by 12:

66 cookies / 12 = 5.5

So Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.
1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines from each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines are Sean's, he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.
The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract 55 from 145:
145 - 55 = 90

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8. 

The answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 39 = (1/10)x

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 10: 
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. 

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * 5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
The youngest son washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Kai bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for each day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much the desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she paid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids rose 3 times. 

The initial bid was $200. After the first bid, the price became $250. After the second bid, it became $300, and after the third bid, it became $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids at $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of the initial bid and the 3 bids she made: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

The desk costs Carmen $1100."
"To calculate the total miles driven per year, we need to calculate the miles driven per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a year.

Miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles (to and from work) = 60 miles
Miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is:
Total bonus = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus:
Total cost = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 * 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

Since the paper is folded in half, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to make a tabloid."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she had.

Annika started with $50.
She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides.
So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in both years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year. So, the total number of books sold in both years is 90 + 45 = 135.

Since the total number of books sold in both years is 200, we can set up the equation: 90 + 45 = 200. This equation is true, so we can confirm that our calculations are correct.

To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to multiply the number of books she sold in the second year by the price of each book, which is 20$. 

45 * 20 = 900

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses per week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old six years ago.
   Noah's age six years ago = 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

2. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago as follows:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 20
   Population of Chile six years ago = 60000

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can calculate the current population of Chile as follows:
   Current population of Chile = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
   Current population of Chile = 2 * 60000
   Current population of Chile = 120000

The final answer is: 120000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."

Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

"To find the total number of people at the beginning, we need to add the number of men and women. 
Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:
Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

We know the total number of pencils is 26. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Combine the constants: 3x + 48 = 26

Subtract 48 from both sides: 3x = -22

Divide both sides by 3: x = -22/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, this doesn't make sense. However, we can try to find a whole number solution. 

Let's try x = 8. 

Jam has 3(8) + 2 = 26 pencils. 

This works, so Jam has 8 pencils in each box. 

Now, we can find the total number of boxes needed. 

Jam has 3 boxes and Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3(8) + 2 + 46 = 26 + 46 = 72. 

The total number of boxes is 3 + 1 = 4.

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and each person got 1 new record for every 2 old records they brought in, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records they brought in.

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 people got on at the second stop. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop (7) from the total number of people heading to the third stop (20).

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 0.5 = 2 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 2 = 78.

The customer paid $78 on this shopping trip."
"To calculate the net pay for Job A, we need to first calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes.

Total income for Job A = $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
Total tax for Job A = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To calculate the net pay for Job B, we need to first calculate the net income before property tax, then subtract the property tax and the taxes on the net income.

Net income before property tax = $42,000
Property tax = $6,000
Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax on net income = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

There are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100."
"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and divide by the number of people.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to calculate the amount Thomas ate first. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60.

60"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows.

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he had 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 balls initially. 

However, he dropped 3 balls, and 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 

7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight: 20 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 300 pounds"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel received 24 outfits from her friend.
She received twice that amount at the baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

"To find the new distance Tyson runs each day, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new distance Tyson runs each day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Since Juice Box A is 4 dollars and Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Since Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly costs of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100

"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Wednesday: 0.5 hours
Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his time was spent sightseeing. We can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 40%:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract it from the cost of the phone.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, so we need to subtract this from her total earnings:
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs to save $195 to buy the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

She also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget.

$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming she doesn't charge her friends for the activities), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend.

$60 / $0 = theoretically, but since she can't invite a fraction of a friend, we can say she can invite 60 friends.

However, considering the cost of the activities, we can say she can invite 60 friends if she doesn't buy any additional items or snacks for them."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left. This means he had $2 initially, and he spent $2 on gumballs, so he must have had $4 initially.

Billy had $10 initially, and he spent $4 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on candy ($6) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$6 / $1.5 = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

Now, let's solve for 'x':

2x - 5 = 45
2x = 50

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 675.

18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days."

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip to his friend's house, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

To find the time taken for the trip back home, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. Minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out is 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before. 
We know Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 
So Sara had 4.67 points before. 
Since Erin scored 8 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting 8 from 14: 14 - 8 = 6."

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

Now, we have 40 - 20 = 20 pupils left. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we need to divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday, and she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday, she picked 2 * 14 = 28 apples on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 28 (Wednesday) = 54 apples

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, we can find the number of socks Lindsay has missed by subtracting the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks.

50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15 socks

The answer is 15."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

Final answer: 0"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate and divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12 = 0.008333 (approximately)

Total amount = $3,650
Number of months = 5

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months

So, Karan has to pay $730 per month.

The final answer is: $730"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

The answer is 67."
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 - $18 = $18

Finally, we divide the total profit by the number of hours to find the profit per hour: 
$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 + 26 = 52. However, half of them can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 52 / 2 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26. 

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people who can make it. The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

First, we add up all the scores:

"To find out how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Dasha saves $30 - $18 = $12.

So, David saves $12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Now, let's divide the total ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

"To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

First, we find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since Sam has 6 parts, he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he's bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

So, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package and getting streaming services."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 1.5 hours
- Editing time: 1.5 hours
Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more, we get 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards received: 17
Cards given away: 29

Total cards Erica now has: 50 + 17 - 29 = 38

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a decimal or find the whole number equivalent. 

7/12 is approximately 0.583, or 5 whole slices and 7/12 of a slice.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from 5 whole slices:
5 - 2 = 3

Now, we need to add the remaining 7/12 to 3. To do this, we convert 3 to a fraction with the same denominator (12):
3 = 36/12

Now, we add the fractions:
36/12 + 7/12 = 43/12

To convert 43/12 to a whole number, we divide 43 by 12:
43 ÷ 12 = 3.583

So, there are 3 whole slices and 7/12 of a slice left.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

Mark earns $10 per day, so we can divide the bike cost by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to work to save the money.

$300 (bike cost) ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

However, Mark is short $250, so he needs to work for 30 days to earn the remaining amount and then buy the bike.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of milk per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the energy used per day: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours)

Now, we multiply this by 30 days: 
7.2 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Since the air conditioner is used for 5 hours less, we calculate the new energy used per day: 
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Now, we calculate the new total energy used in 30 days: 
2.7 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved, we subtract the new total from the old total: 
216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours = 135 kilowatt-hours

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week = 1600 hours
Total amount paid in May = 1600 hours * $15/hour = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.
Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week = 1200 hours
Total amount paid in June = 1200 hours * $15/hour = $18,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. 

Assuming the 5% that smell like wet dog is the same percentage that also explode, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as 5% of 50000.

5% of 50000 = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

However, without knowing the actual percentage of candles that explode, we cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 60 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + A = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

A = 410

So, Joanne gathers 410 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 410"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation based on the number of bumps:

2C + D = 304 (since each camel contributes 2 bumps and each dromedary contributes 1 bump)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and each animal has one head. So, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations:

2C + D = 304
C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first one:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. The remaining cats are 50 - 20 = 30.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is 30 * 3/5 = 18.
4. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The remaining 8 months: 8 months * $14/month = $112

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total savings from the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the rest of the savings (2/3) must be from the tattered jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of x, which is x/3. The total savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 of $28, which is 2/3 * 28 = 56/3. 

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation: x/3 + 56/3 = 6. 

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x + 56 = 18. 

Subtracting 56 from both sides, we get x = -38. However, the price cannot be negative. This means our initial assumption about the original price of the jogger jeans is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. The original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of (x - (x + 6)), which is 1/3 * (-6) = -2. The total savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 of 28, which is 56/3. 

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation: -2 + 56/3 = 6.

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards. He keeps 1/3 of them, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

x = 150

However, this equation doesn't make sense because x is the number of cards, not the amount of money. We need to find the number of cards that Kenny started with.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Kenny sells 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, and he gets $50 in spending cash. This means that the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $50. We can set up the equation:

2x/3 * 1.5 = 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 50 * 3 / 2 * 1.5
x = 50 * 3 / 3
x = 50

However, this is still not correct. We need to find the total number of cards Kenny started with. We know that he sells 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, and he gets $50 in spending cash. This means that the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $50. We can set up the equation:

2x/3 * 1.5 = 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x/3 * 1.5 = 50
2x/3 * 3/2 = 50
2x = 50 * 3/2
2x = 75
x = 75/2
x = 37.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, this would mean that Kenny would have to sell more cards to get $50, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

Let's re-evaluate the situation again. Kenny sells 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, and he gets $50 in spending cash. This means that the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $50. We can set up the equation:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x/3 * 1.5 = 50
2x/3 * 3/2 = 50
2x = 50 * 3/2
2x = 75
x = 75/2
x = 37.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we can try to find the closest whole number. Let's try x = 38.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, but there were 40 guests in total. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests who got two hotdogs from the total number of guests. 

40 (total guests) - 18 (guests who got two hotdogs) = 22

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount:
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

Since she needs $19 and has $18, she needs $19 - $18 = $1 more to buy the items."
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons = 15 * 1/4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount of money he had left: 1% of $5 is $0.05. So, he had $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 left.

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars. We subtract the amount he had left from the total amount he spent: $5 - $4.95 = $0.05.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can calculate the number of candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $0.05 / 0.75 = 0.0667. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 0.

However, since George bought 3 bags of chips, and we know he spent $0.05 on candy bars, we can try to find the number of candy bars by dividing the amount spent on chips by the cost of one candy bar and then subtracting the result from the total number of bags of chips. 

3 * 40 = 120 cents. 120 / 0.75 = 160. So, he could have bought 160 candy bars if he spent all his money on candy bars. Since he spent $0.05 on candy bars, he actually bought 0 candy bars."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who had a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.
Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

Initially, the house is 40 degrees.

Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

The final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature is 49."
"To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. Since Jon's run time is 50 minutes, James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can multiply the distance by the cost of hay per mile:

Total cost of hay = Distance * Cost per mile
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $3/mile
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so we can find out how much money he has in total:

Total money = Number of bills * Value per bill
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, we can say that he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18.

The final answer is: $0"

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $1 (the extra cost of the super ticket) + $3 (the cost of the soda) = $4.

So, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $20 + $2 = $22.

Now, we know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $4. We can set up an equation to find the price of the popcorn:

$12 + P + $3 = $22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$12 + P + $3 = $22
$15 + P = $22
P = $22 - $15
P = $7

The regular price of the popcorn is $7."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the original cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

The cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 
$65 * 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is 11050."

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds = 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed = 320 / 2 = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost = 160 * 12 = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob will be $1920."

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We also know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

4400 / 2250 = 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we need to calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's total.

60% of 10 plants = 0.6 * 10 = 6
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 6
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. 
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is 9."

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Since she keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students, she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given away (300) by 10 to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. 9 - 8 = 1.

The difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky is 1 dollar."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

Multiply the total number of items per room by the number of rooms:
15 items per room * 80 rooms = 1200

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

He starts with 200 shoes.
On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 200 + 5 = 205 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, so he now has 205 + 15 = 220 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, so he now has 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.
On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so he now has 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils
2. Calculate the number of pencils used in two months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = 300 * 1/5 = 60 pencils
3. Calculate the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils
4. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year: 1/3 of 240 pencils = 240 * 1/3 = 80 pencils

There are 80 pencils left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books.

300 ÷ 15 = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we have counted the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The answer is 6."
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors without the discount is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. So, the total cost will be $4.00.

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since we are looking for the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer and will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. 
Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

90,000"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Then, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how long it takes Royce, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert 2 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we multiply Rob's time by 2 and add 40 minutes.

2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

The answer is 280 minutes."

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the amount each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the quarts each person can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Original daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house (5 days for half a house * 2).

Now, if 5 people are working together, we can divide the total time it would take for one person to paint a whole house by 5. 

10 days / 5 people = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply the number of days by 24 to get the total hours.

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we add the number of sofas and chairs they have: 
20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 108."
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, let's divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD:
$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. This means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on the bus. So, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote James' current age as 'x'. 

In 5 years, James will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:
x + 10 = 2x + 5 - 5
x + 10 = 2x
10 = x

Now that we know James' current age is 10, we can find the age of his cousin. 
In 8 years, James' cousin will be 10 + 8 = 18 years old.

The age difference between James and his cousin is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 
300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Since George has 3 candies left after eating 5, we can find out how many candies he had initially by adding 5 to 3. 
George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies initially.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had initially by 2 to find out how many candies Nick had.
Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

The final answer is 16."
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the total vlogs she wants to make.

72 (total vlogs) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."

He then spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times $13, which is $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families notified in each round and then add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:

(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the pyramid.

The initial angle is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

In 10 hours, the sun will move 10 * 5 = 50 degrees.

Since the sun started at the tip of the pyramid, we need to subtract the initial angle from the new angle to find the angle from the ground to the sun.

New angle = 32 + 50 = 82 degrees

Angle from the ground to the sun = 82 degrees

The final answer is 82."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son is 8 years old, so he will need 8 candles. 

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week.

70 + 100 = 170

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals: 
80 - 20 = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals: 
80 - 45 = 35

So, the number of goals scored by each teenager is as follows:
- Richie: 80
- Mark: 60
- Anna: 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 
80 + 60 + 35 = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell: 21
Price of each lemonade: $4
Total amount Mitchell made: 21 * 4 = $84

Now, let's compare the amount Mitchell made to the amount Liam made. 
Liam made $63.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made: 
$84 - $63 = $21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of $5 * 3 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $55 left, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

27"
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in the account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed and subtract it from the initial amount.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in the account after 2 years is $600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 10 / 10 = 1 loaf
Cost of bread = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Since the cost is given per 10 sandwiches, we need to calculate the cost for 10 sandwiches:
Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. 

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 (carpet) + $864 (removal) + $7344 (installation) = $10040.

The final answer is: $10040"

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to add 4% to the set temperature to get the correct temperature. 

First, we find 4% of 520: 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

Now, we add 20.8 to 520: 
520 + 20.8 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees.

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 
10% of $100.00 is $10.00, so the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, and Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total number of contacts he will get is 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 times 100 ml of water, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 words, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM.
Then, he increases his speed by 5 words again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57 WPM. 
To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it's taller than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.
The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven in a month to find the total number of rotations per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

To find the total number of rotations in a year, we multiply the number of rotations per month by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20
Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he won't have any money left after the purchase.

Final answer: $0"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed for each dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

The final answer is: $312"

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

"To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by students:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum. 

After dinner, he chews 1 more piece of gum.

So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: 
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $1600
- Silver jewel: $1200

Total price for all three jewels = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $10
Total cost of classes = $100

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $100, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $100.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. The total cost will be:
Total cost = Number of classes taken * Cost per class
Total cost = (10 - x) * $10

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to $100.

(10 - x) * $10 ≤ $100
10 - x ≤ $10
-x ≤ -$10
x ≥ $20

Since x represents the number of classes, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 20.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000

Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / 0.5 feet/hour = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The well will take 22 hours to dig."
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

For himself, he needs 2 cupcakes.
For his teacher, he needs 2 cupcakes.
For his 25 classmates, he needs 25 * 2 = 50 cupcakes.

Adding these together, we get: 2 (for himself) + 2 (for his teacher) + 50 (for his classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70. 

Initial likes = 2000 / 70
Initial likes = 28.57

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes. 

Total likes = 2000 + 20000
Total likes = 22000

The final answer is: 22000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost was 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount. The discount amount is 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3. So, the total cost was 20 * $30 - $3 = $597.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $597 - $398 = $199."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, the sales of red hats can be represented as G/2.

We know that the total sales of red hats in the first month is $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 800

Now that we know the sales of green hats, we can calculate the total sales of the first month:

Total sales of the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Total sales of the second month = 3/4 * 1200
= 900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales of both months:

Total amount = Total sales of the first month + Total sales of the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Subtract the current bank balance from the expected wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's wage was overpaid by $120."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of whole eggs needed.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens needed.

24 whole eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 * 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
= 15 - 5

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 * $10,000 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 minutes is 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of other items) = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total number of hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total number of hours John spends in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so the total number of recipes he learns is 48 / 1.5 = 32.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they share equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

So, each person would have $120.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and 10 neutral days in the first 30 days. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in the month. 
12 (good) + 8 (bad) + 10 (neutral) = 30 days

Since the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we can add those to the total. 
3 (good) + 1 (neutral) + 3 (good) = 7 days

Now, we subtract the total days from the initial 30 days to find the remaining days. 
30 - 7 = 23 days

Since Christina had 12 good days initially, we subtract the 3 good days from the remaining days to find the number of good days left. 
12 - 3 = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18
x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.
4. However, when James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs 24 - 4 = 20 more toys.
6. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 20 - 3 = 17 more toys.

In total, James needs 12 (initially needed) + 20 (additional needed) + 17 (additional needed after 3 dogs left) = 49 toys.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending it by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

Let's denote the age of the triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 37

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find out how many points the class has, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of children of each generation and add them together.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she put into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720"
"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Since we are asked to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city display and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 more friends they meet at the cinema. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends
Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed as follows:

Total number of drinks = 2 * Total number of people
Total number of drinks = 2 * 20
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = 3 * Total number of people
Total number of snacks = 3 * 20
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks as follows:

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * $2
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * $2
Total cost of snacks = 60 * $2
Total cost of snacks = $120

Total cost of drinks and snacks = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $80 + $120
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry and then determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he initially received. 

Since the total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5, and Gerald received 3 parts, we can calculate his share as follows:

Gerald's share = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:

Gerald's remaining money = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: 68"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of the croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of the cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of the mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, let's apply the 10% discount: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00
The total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops for free. So, she can buy 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free.

The total number of scoops she can buy is 4, but she can only use 2 scoops. 

The answer is 4.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

24 * 24 = 576

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 compared to buying at the store."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since we can't have a negative amount, this means that fixing the pothole would actually cost Ron $255 more than not fixing it."

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.33 x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 people, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all 5 people: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches: 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe in inches: 
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is 40% in decimal form).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake.
2. Mara added 3 slices, so now the plate has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. She tripled the number of slices, so now the plate has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so now the plate has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so now the plate has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals and divide it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Total number of animals = 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses
Total number of animals = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost of the first amusement park, we need to multiply the number of adults by the adult fee and the number of children by the child fee, then add the two amounts together.

For the first amusement park: 
Adults: 2 * $26 = $52
Children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
Adults: 2 * $14 = $28
Children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:
$76 - $48 = $28

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old and new vendors.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50 per day.

To find out how much he saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:
$50 per day * 7 days = $350 per week.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (12). 

However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, but the activity requires 6 groups. This seems to be a contradictory statement. Assuming the activity requires 6 groups, we can proceed with the calculation.

To find the number of students per group, we divide 54 by 6:
54 ÷ 6 = 9

Since the question asks for the number of groups needed to form, and we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are required to reach the total of 12 groups.

12 (required groups) - 6 (existing groups) = 6

So, 6 more groups are needed to form the required 12 groups."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 days.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 60 * 20 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 days.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 100 * 8 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 (weekdays) + 800 (weekends) = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
3. Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity per year and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. There are 12 months in a year, so the total cost of electricity per year is:
$100 * 12 = $1200

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of roommates:
$1200 / 4 = $300

So each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates, then subtract the number of broken ones.

Initial glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Broken glasses: 10
Broken plates: 6

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and double the number of matches on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

So, the total number of matches Joey played is: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation 'x'. 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of votes is 33, so the sum of votes in favor and against is equal to 33. 

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the discount amount, multiply the marked price by the discount percentage (as a decimal). 

Discount = 5% = 0.05
Discount amount = 140 * 0.05 = 7

"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we first need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win and how many people think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find out how many people are remaining after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - people who think horse #2 will win - people who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of girls. 
3 * 6 = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If there are 18 Pomeranians, then the total number of puppies is 3 times the number of Pomeranians. 
3 * 18 = 54

The answer is 54."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, we can calculate it as follows:
1/2 * 250 = 125 cases

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we multiply 125 by 2:
125 * 2 = 250 cases

The third house will need 250 cases of shingles.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We also know that he made $60 from eggplants. To find out how much he needs to make from corn, we subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: 135 - 60 = $75.

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25) to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for: 75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= (400 - 160) * 10
= 240 * 10
= $2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we need to find half of their driving speed. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Emma's score is 10x + 15 and Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 12.

Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower, her time is x + 4 and Ava's time is x.

The time is not directly related to the score, but we can use it to find the difference in their scores. We know that the time is the same for both players, so we can set up an equation:

10(x + 8) + 12 = 10x + 15 + 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 80 = 10x + 19

Subtracting 10x from both sides, we get:

80 = 19

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract 30 dollars from 64 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining amount by 2:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times.

The total number of times they ride their bikes is 15 + 6 = 21 times.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we'll ignore this result). We'll assume the assistant took out 17 fish from the total number of fish in the tank, not just the orange ones.

Let's say the total number of fish in the tank was x. The number of white fish in the tank was 4, and the number of orange fish was 3. The total number of fish was x = 3 + 4 = 7.

Since the assistant took out 17 fish, the new total number of fish in the tank is x - 17.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish after the assistant took out 17 fish is y. Then, the number of orange fish is 2y.

We know that the total number of fish after the assistant took out 17 fish is x - 17. We can set up an equation:

x - 17 = 2y

We also know that the number of white fish after the assistant took out 17 fish is y. We can set up another equation:

y = 4 - 17 (since the assistant took out 17 fish from the 4 white fish)

y = -13 (this is not possible, so we'll ignore this result). We'll assume the assistant took out 17 fish from the total number of white fish, not just the 4 white fish.

Let's try again. The number of white fish after the assistant took out 17 fish is y. We can set up an equation:

y = 4 - 17 is not correct, so we'll try y = 4 - (17 - y)

y = 4 - 17 + y

y = -13 is not possible, so we'll try y = 4 - (17 - y) = 4 - 17 + y

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week:

Fuel consumption per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of fuel consumption per week:

Cost of fuel consumption per week = Fuel consumption per week * Price per gallon
Cost of fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of fuel consumption per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, so Carson needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to 32 degrees.

"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10 groups.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The final answer is 12."

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in the first month: 200 employees * $4000 = $800,000
Total amount paid in the second month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in the third month: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000

Total amount paid in three months: $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides, we get:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7, we get:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per square inch and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 square inches long.

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower: 
- 3 - 1 = 2
- 4 - 1 = 3
- 5 - 1 = 4

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used:
John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.
Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used marshmallows) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together:
17 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 8.5 S'mores.

Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores for each kid.

John and DeSean can have 8 S'mores each.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he plays 240 / 20 = 12 games.

One of his friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, they play 240 / 10 = 24 games.

The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, they play 240 / 30 = 8 games.

The total number of games played is 12 (Jack) + 24 (first friend) + 8 (second friend) = 44 games.

The cost per game is 1 quarter, which is $0.25. So the total cost is 44 * $0.25 = $11.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40.
The cost of shipping the book is also 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60.
The total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

The book's original price is $32, but Amazon will only refund 75% of that. So, the refund will be 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Since the cost of shipping is more than the refund, Milly will lose $3.00 - $24 = -$21.

However, since Milly can't lose money, we need to consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and the refund is $24, so Milly will lose $32 - $24 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan initially had $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, it means she is in debt."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends on each activity: 72 videos (recording) + 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

The final answer is: 86"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. 
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items. 
The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the information that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. We can set up a proportion to find the distance.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 kangaroos * 18 hours
Distance = 54 hours

Now we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 54 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 13.5 hours

The final answer is: 13.5"
"To find the total number of clay dishes, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $50, so we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Now, subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces per day (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows needed.

5 cows - 3 cows = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

To find the total number of dishes, we know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and 10 goats were sold, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Farm Y had 45 goats and twice as many goats were sold, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year: $2640
Number of pairs bought per year: 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the green food: 
3 baskets of green food * $25 per basket = $75

Next, calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:
3 baskets of red food * $18 per basket = $54
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the total cost of the red food:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, 12 homes are built.

In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they double the number of homes built in the previous two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Then, my brother's age is x + 3, and my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of our ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs: 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, he will need 7 packs of glue sticks.

7 packs of glue sticks will provide 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks, which is more than the 54 glue sticks needed. Therefore, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. 
On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. In a year, Amber earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Now, we need to divide this amount by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
Tobias ate 2/5 of 60 pieces, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. 
He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces, which is (7/13) * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece).

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.
26 - 14 = 12

So, Tobias has eaten 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

The final answer is 48."

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100 plants. 
One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants.
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants.
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x. 
Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. 
We know the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. 
So, we can write the equation: 
11x = 121 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 
Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. 
Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5: 
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11 
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works per week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works per week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6 * 13 = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, and Calvin is an adult, we can assume the pot can fill 4 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 adults. 

Since the pot can fill 4 bowls, and there are 4 adults, there will be 0 bowls of soup left for the children.

However, since the question asks about lunch, we need to consider the leftover soup from dinner. Assuming Calvin has enough soup for dinner, and everyone eats one bowl, there will be 0 bowls left for the children.

But, if we consider the leftover soup from dinner, we can assume Calvin has enough soup for 4 bowls. Since there are 4 adults, there will be 0 bowls left for the children.

However, if we consider the leftover soup from dinner, and Calvin has enough soup for 4 bowls, and there are 4 adults, there will be 0 bowls left for the children.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write:

D = 60

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

60 = 2A

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we can add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

We know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, and the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. So, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we can set up the equation: 3x = 18

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 18 / 3
x = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5 for 2, the cost of 12 balloons is (12/2) * 0.5 = $3.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) = $14.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $14 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can say that the total amount they had initially is also $28. To find out how much their mother gave each of them, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Then, we subtract the number of fruits Lola ate, which is 2.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold, the total cost of the lollipops, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):
24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea Lana has left after brewing the cinnamon tea. 

She started with 27 cups and used 15 for cinnamon tea, so she has 27 - 15 = 12 cups left.

Since she divides the remaining cups into 3 rows, we need to divide 12 by 3 to find out how many cups are in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips, which equals 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 
Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 
5000 gallons - (500 gallons * 6 days) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The answer is 2000."
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$124 / $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

There are 5 days in total. 
Average Junebugs removed per day = 300 / 5 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

Total number of toys Sophie already had: 31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Total number of toys Sophie now has: 62

Number of bouncy balls in the tube: 62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the third equation: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of P from the third equation into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (10) to the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

25"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

(400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets
Total money from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide 100 by 25. 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find out how much James spent, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.
Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30:
60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she woke up at 5:55 p.m. (10 p.m. - 5 minutes).

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep:
- Time from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 4 hours 15 minutes = 255 minutes
- Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
- Time from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. = 3 hours 17 minutes = 197 minutes

Total time she was asleep = 255 minutes + 23 minutes + 197 minutes = 475 minutes

However, we need to subtract the 5 minutes she woke up early. 
Total time she slept on her bed = 475 minutes - 5 minutes = 470 minutes

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
2. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)
3. X + S + A = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokémon)

We can substitute the value of X from equation 1 into equation 3:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 2 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each direction and then add them together.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, we subtract the distance traveled from the initial distance to get the net distance traveled north:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, we add the distance traveled to the net distance traveled north:
264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at her office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), Nani's brother (16), and Nani's sister (6).

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we need to add 7 to Carlton's team size. 

Carlton's team has 13 players, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total number of wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she had initially.

240 - 4 = 236 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find 1/4 of 236.

1/4 * 236 = 59 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had initially.

240 - 59 = 181 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 181 oranges.

181"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29.

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much money Tyler needs to buy the books, we need to add the costs of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook. 

$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total.

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's total from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (20 + 30)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $520

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2 to find the average size. 
(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, we multiply the daily pretzel consumption by 7 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

9 pretzels * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the amount used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil.

30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 (monthly income) - $500 (monthly savings) = $1,500 (monthly expenses)

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can divide her monthly expenses by the cost of a pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

$1,500 (monthly expenses) / $1,000 (cost of a pair of shoes) = 1.5 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

1.5 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 18 pairs/year

So, Jessica can buy 18 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 degrees.

So, the net cooling effect is 6 - 12 + 2 = -4 degrees.

The final temperature is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final temperature is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 * 30 = x + 75 (since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years)

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem states that Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This information is not relevant to the calculation of the lawyer's contribution.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, and we don't know the exact amount of money Walter's friend is going to give, we can't calculate the exact amount of the lawyer's contribution. But if we assume that Walter's friend is not going to contribute, the lawyer's contribution would be 3 times the total amount collected so far, which is $2000. 

So, the lawyer's contribution would be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices and then the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, let's say each kid gets a slice of size y. Then, each adult gets 2y.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2y + 4y = 6.

Combine like terms: 6y = 6.

Divide both sides by 6: y = 1.

So each kid gets a slice of size 1, and each adult gets 2 slices.

Since the total number of slices is 6, and each adult gets 2 slices, each adult gets 2/6 = 1/3 of the watermelon.

To find the percentage, multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost, which is $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61920 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6192

The final answer is: $6192"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

Number of red sticks = 9
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the number of hours they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. 

450 - 220 = 230

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons were pumped.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons were pumped.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total money spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend negative money, we need to recheck the calculation.

Let's recheck the calculation:
He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total money spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

However, Jamaar only has $10, so he can't afford to buy any more fruits. The initial calculation was correct.

Since Jamaar can't afford any more fruits, the answer is 0 plums."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by 18 pages to find the total time spent reading.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the remaining guests are 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas.

22"
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total revenue from large stuffed animals. Let's say Teresa sold L large stuffed animals. Then, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 12L.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals is 2L.

The total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2L * (x/3) = 2L * (12/3) = 8L.

We know that the total revenue from both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12L + 8L = 120

Combine like terms:

20L = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

L = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

Number of small stuffed animals = 2L = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 
So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to get the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs the friends found is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To find the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by 30.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Now, we multiply this by 30 days to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 
150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years Jim spent in college (4 years) by his annual income before college ($25,000). 

$25,000 * 4 years = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned while in college. Since he got $50,000 in loans per year, we need to subtract the loans from his new income to find the amount he actually earned.

$75,000 - $50,000 = $25,000 per year

Since he spent 4 years in college, the total amount of money he earned while in college is:

$25,000 * 4 years = $100,000

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Jim lost from not working while in school. We already calculated this earlier as $100,000.

To find the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working, we add the total amount of money he lost to the total amount of money he earned while in college.

$100,000 (lost) + $100,000 (earned) = $200,000

Since Jim earns $75,000 per year after college, we can divide the total amount he needs to earn ($200,000) by his new income ($75,000) to find the number of years it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working.

$200,000 / $75,000 = 2.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 2.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric separately and then add them together.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.

The area of the first piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.
The area of the second piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to add the areas together: 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 13000

The total population in South America is 13,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours of work, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total hours worked by the team by 24:

Total hours worked by the team = 7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

Hours worked by each painter = 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

1955 - 325 = 1630

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile:

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 
The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 
$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he collected each year and add them together.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from each year: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's slices: 
10 - 3 = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find Silvia's slices:
7 * 2 = 14

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices together:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the visit costs $300/2 = $150.

The cast costs $200.

The painkillers cost $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the painkillers cost 30 * $4 = $120.

The parking costs $6/hour for 2 hours, so the parking costs 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

So, the number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails in a day, he will respond to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter required for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter required by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00 and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

The total cost will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * 60 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had.
$120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (15/12) = $18.75.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * 5 = $25.

Now, let's subtract the cost of roses from the total amount of money she has: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can divide $6.25 by 0.25 to find out how many quarters she gets: $6.25 / 0.25 = 25.

Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time Paul waits for his train. Paul arrives at the station when the first train leaves (30 minutes), and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. So, Paul waits for 145 - 30 = 115 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation: 
Original price * 0.75 = $2000
Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
120% of $2000 = 1.2 * $2000 = $2400

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100.
Discount = ($2666.67 - $2400) / $2666.67
Discount = $266.67 / $2666.67
Discount = 0.1 or 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours, and then multiply that by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk to the store is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked back home, the total distance he covered is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store and walk back home.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years.

Growth rate = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the growth rate by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which is 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract them from the total to find the number of MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: 17.6875"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'x', the amount they ate is x/2.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms.

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 540 + 270 = 810.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda, we need to calculate the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed if she picks the last shaken soda. 

There are 12 sodas in total, and 1 of them is shaken. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed is 1 out of 12, which is 1/12 or approximately 8.33%.

The final answer is 8.33."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, the number of days Billy is available is 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the total number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy is available by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150 people.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people
Number of people in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Total number of people: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people

The church was not mentioned to be empty, so we can assume that all the people were inside the church. 

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the information given:

1. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. 
   Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
   Martha's age = 24 - 4
   Martha's age = 20

2. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
   Jeff's age = 20 + 10
   Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of returned item: $15.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $58.00

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
New purchases: $58.00
New total: $70.00 + $58.00 = $128.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Caroline is 24 years old.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement. Assuming the intention was to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed with the corrected calculation.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Lauren will live on 40% of her income, which is $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years:

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years it will take her to save:

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the time it will take her to save the amount she needs, not the time she needs to work. Since she needs to save $400,000 and she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount by her annual savings to find out how many years it will take her to save:

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

Since she needs to save for 20 years and she saves $20,000 per year, it will take her 20 years to save the amount she needs. However, this is the time it will take her to save the amount she needs, not the time she needs to work. To find the time she needs to work, we need to consider her income and expenses.

Lauren's annual income is $100,000, and she spends $40,000 per year. This leaves her with $60,000 per year to save. Since she needs to save $400,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years it will take her to save:

$400,000 / $60,000 = 6.67 years.

Since she can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, this is the time it will take her to save the amount she needs, not the time she needs to work. To find the time she needs to work, we need to consider her income and expenses.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys in the school.

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can divide the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of the percentage of boys: 240 / 0.4 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

The number of girls in the school is the total number of students minus the number of boys: 600 - 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

Cost of pots: $19

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55

"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since the question mentions James, but doesn't mention him buying any apples, we can assume James is the one left with the remaining apples. 

The total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, the amount of apples left for James is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But this is not possible since she has $2 left. This means the initial $4 she spent was not spent on the books, but on something else. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, but we don't know what she spent it on. Let's assume she spent it on something else. Now, she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. She bought 2 books for $x each, and she has $2 left. So, 2x + 2 = 12. 

2x = 10
x = 5

So, each book cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times it blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 
So, the blinking rate is 255 / 5 = 51 times per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. 
Time = Total blinks / Blinking rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's compare the total number of male and female fish:
Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16

To find the difference, subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish:
16 - 11 = 5

Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2. 

140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2.

280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10).

20 / 10 = 2

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since 2 years have passed, we add 2 to his age 2 years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight per box.

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16.

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, we multiply the number of logs by 5 to get the total number of planks.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Let's say the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach is x minutes. Then, the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2x minutes.

We know that 2x = 40 minutes, so we can solve for x:

2x = 40
x = 40 / 2
x = 20 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, it takes her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Therefore, it takes her 20 / 2 = 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we can find the total time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time on sidewalk = 10 minutes
Time on beach = 20 minutes
Total time for 3 miles = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 30 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save, which is $60. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny has 2 mugs of water initially. Let's assume the unknown temperature mug has x ounces of water. 

After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, Donny has 4 ounces left in the 33-degree mug. 

He also has 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug. 

The total amount of water Donny has now is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

We know that the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water. We can set up an equation to find the temperature of the unknown mug:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * 40 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the unknown temperature mug has at least 68 degrees of water.

The final answer is 68."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the total cost of the bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 9 bagels in each pack. So, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

The total cost of the bagels is 36 bagels * $10.00/bagel = $360.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $360.00 = 0.10 * $360.00 = $36.00.

The total cost after the discount is $360.00 - $36.00 = $324.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = Total cost / Total number of bagels = $324.00 / 36 bagels = $9.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory:
60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks
Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost and the loss:
Total cost = $100 (initial investment)
Total revenue = $84
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue = $100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the maximum number of days among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The maximum number of days required is 9 days for the large-sized picture scenes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May (31 days) and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish ($1).

Total number of fish: 3
Daily cost per fish: $1
Total daily cost: 3 * $1 = $3
Total cost for 31 days: $3 * 31 = $93

Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May."
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the roses she gave away and add the roses she bought.

She started with 30 roses.
She gave away 24 roses, so she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left.
Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 
27 - 5 = 22

Now, we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, we can divide 22 by 2 to find out how many Carrey collected.
22 / 2 = 11

Now that we know how many seashells each person initially collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells.
27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally between themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got.
60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each. Since there are 2 days, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

The first song is 5 minutes long, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs together: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find Carl's cane length, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall.
Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the maximum number of bottles they can produce and then calculate the difference.

The maximum number of bottles Hortex can produce is 4200. 

Let's recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 4200 * (2300 * 0.2) / 2300

x = 4200 * 0.2

x = 840

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 840 - 4200 = -3360

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 4200 * (2300 * 0.2) / 2300

x = 4200 * 0.2

x = 840

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, and the total demand is 840 bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

4200 (current production) - 840 (total demand) = 3360

The final answer is: 3360"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple. 

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing bows is 2 + (1/3 * 8) = 2 + 2.67 = 4.67 (round down to 4, since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The probability is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%."

Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * 3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.
2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

To find the number of eggs still hidden, subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs:
36 (initial eggs) - 27 (eggs found) = 9 eggs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into R = 4B, we get R = 4(Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 and R = 4(Y - 7) into the equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 21 = 37.

Add 21 to both sides: 6Y = 58.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 9.67.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 9.67 - 7 = 2.67.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(2.67) = 10.68.

The final answer is: 10.68"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa and Ronnie had initially. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie had x dollars, Rissa had 3x dollars. 

We know that after giving an equal amount of money to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say the amount she gave to her sister is y. 

So, 3x - y = (4/5)(3x) 
3x - y = 12x/5 
5(3x - y) = 12x 
15x - 5y = 12x 
3x = 5y 
y = 3x/5 

Now, we know that Rissa gave 3x/5 dollars to her sister. Since she had 3x dollars initially, she is left with 3x - 3x/5 = 12x/5 dollars. 

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so 12x/5 = (4/5)(3x) 
12x/5 = 12x/5 

This equation is true for all values of x. However, we know that Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so the amount she gave must be less than 3x/5. 

Let's try x = 5. 
Rissa had 3x = 15 dollars initially. She gave 3x/5 = 3 dollars to her sister. 
She is left with 15 - 3 = 12 dollars. 

Since 12 is 4/5 of 15, this solution is correct. 

So, Ronnie had 5 dollars initially. He gave 3/5 dollars to his sister. 
He is left with 5 - 3/5 = 2 dollars. 

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

100 (number of pods in the regular box) + 20% of 100 (20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box contains 120 pods. We also know that you can run one cycle per pod. 

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total cost of the new box ($12) by the cost per pod ($12/120 pods = $0.1 per pod). 

Now, we can divide the amount you have ($1) by the cost per pod ($0.1) to find out how many cycles you can run:

$1 / $0.1 = 10

So, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

2.25 = 0.20 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.25 / 0.20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

6 (cheese pizzas) + 8 (pepperoni pizzas) = 14 pizzas

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to divide John's current age by 2, since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released.

John's current age is 28. 
Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was x. 
Then, John's age at the time of Digimon's release was 2x. 
Since we know John's current age is 28, we can set up the equation: 
2x + (number of years since Digimon's release) = 28

However, we don't know the exact number of years since Digimon's release. But we can use the fact that Digimon was released 20 years ago. 
So, we can rewrite the equation as: 
2x + 20 = 28
2x = 8
x = 4

This means Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. 
Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the number of years that have passed since Digimon's release: 
Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

So, they ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 19

So, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. 
Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each task and then add them together.

- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00
- He did his laundry once, so he earned $3.00
- He took the trash out twice, so he earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
- He cleaned his room once, so he earned $1.50

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in two weeks."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a single shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to get the amount of blood a shark has: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood ten sharks have:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens = 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens

Total number of pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. 
To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 
50% of $60 is $30. 
So, the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. 
Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: 
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'x'. 

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

Total number of students = 10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

Time taken by 3 full groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes
Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 45 minutes

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to calculate 1/4 of the original amount of pomelos she had.

1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, Eve gave away 5 pomelos."
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples.

So, Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, we can calculate the total hours traveled as follows:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas. 

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.
The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we can divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the total number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase can hold 45 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide 110 by 45.

110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total selling price:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total selling price = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He found a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.

Now, Brendan has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Final answer: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls it takes to get 15 customers, we can divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

15 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 15 * 25 = 375 calls

However, we also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers need to be made to sell 15 cars, we can divide 15 by 1/2 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers).

15 cars / 1/2 car per 2 customers = 15 * 2 = 30 customers

Now, we have two different numbers of customers needed to sell 15 cars. We need to find the larger number, which is 30 customers. 

Since Jason gets 1 customer per 25 calls, we can divide 30 by 1 to find out how many calls it takes to get 30 customers.

30 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 30 * 25 = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is 5. 

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

So, there are 40 robots.

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total items = 40 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs)
Total items = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the hours to minutes and then divide by the time it takes to deal with a call.

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent on land and the time spent in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find out how much Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in June. Since there are 30 days in June, and he makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can multiply the number of days by the number of doughnuts per day.

10 dozen doughnuts = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day
120 doughnuts per day * 30 days in June = 3600 doughnuts in June

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut.

3600 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $7200

Derrick makes $7200 in June."

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to calculate his new speed and then divide the total number of words by that speed.

First, we need to find John's new speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can divide the total number of words by John's new speed to find the time it would take him to speak 10 pages.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 hours

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw from the 4th day to the 7th day. Since he saw an average of 60 people each day, we multiply 60 by 4 (the number of days) to get 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped so far is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 80 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 80 + 80 = 160.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 40 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 160 + 40 = 200.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels. 
   The total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the lemons needed for 2 cups as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The number of pink candies is 43."

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells each person found and subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. 
Total number of seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732

Number of cracked seashells = 67

Number of good seashells = Total number of seashells - Number of cracked seashells
= 732 - 67
= 665

The final answer is: 665"
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

The cost of the dinner plates is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00
The cost of the bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00
The cost of the salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours. 

Then, we add 2 hours to that result, which is 5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"To find out how much feed the pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The answer is 20."
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs the guests will eat and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

The cost of hot dogs: 8 packs * $2 per pack = $16"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

Total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40
Total income from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40
Total income: $40 + $40 = $80

Total cost of trays: 5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Total expenses: $20

Now, let's subtract the total expenses from the total income to find out how much money Frances has left:
$80 - $20 = $60

Frances has $60 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10 * 2 = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, we can multiply 12 by 2 to find the age of the older brother. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16. 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 
12 + 24 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 (since there are 28 days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"

For small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower and the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"". 

The final answer is 67."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The discount on each T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. 
The price of each T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4. 
Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $4 = $8.

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16. 
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes, which is $8 + $24 = $32.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a single ticket: $14.25 ÷ $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for each movie ticket, and $8.50 on a bracelet. Since she bought tickets for herself and her sister, she spent 2 x $7.50 = $15 on movie tickets.

Total amount spent = $3.50 (ice cream) + $15 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given:

$40 - $27 = $13

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered is 29 - 24 = 5.

However, Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor must have lost 5 - 7 = -2 beakers. Since you can't lose a negative number of items, this means that Igor actually gathered 7 beakers instead of 5. 

So, the correct number of beakers Igor gathered is 7, and the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 7 = 0.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = (x/2) * time

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = x * 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 4 / 16
x = 1/4 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's speed = x/2 = (1/4)/2 = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can find her time:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (1/8)
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total amount needed.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they are peeling oranges at the same time, we can assume that the time they spend peeling oranges is directly proportional to the number of oranges they peel.

Let's assume the number of oranges Ana peels is A and the number of oranges Jane peels is J.

Since they spend 3 minutes peeling an orange, the time Ana spends peeling A oranges is 3A minutes, and the time Jane spends peeling J oranges is 4J minutes.

We know that they spend a total of 60 minutes (1 hour) peeling oranges. So, we can set up the equation:

3A + 4J = 60

We also know that the number of oranges they peel is equal to the number of oranges they spend peeling. So, we can set up another equation:

A = J

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute A = J into the first equation:

3J + 4J = 60
7J = 60
J = 60/7
J = 8.57 (approximately)

Since A = J, A is also approximately 8.57.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

Difference = A - J
= 8.57 - 8.57
= 0

So, after an hour, Ana and Jane will peel the same number of oranges.
