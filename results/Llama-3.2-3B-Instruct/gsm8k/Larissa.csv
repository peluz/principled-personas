"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given to the chickens.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken per meal, we need to divide the total feed given so far by 3 to find out how many cups of feed each chicken has received.

40 cups / 3 = 13.33 cups per chicken

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we multiply the amount of feed each chicken has received by the number of chickens.

13.33 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 266.6 cups

Since Wendi can't give a fraction of a cup of feed, we round down to 266 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal. Since she gives 3 cups of feed per chicken, we multiply the number of chickens by 3.

266 cups / 3 = 88.67 cups

Rounding down to the nearest whole number, Wendi needs 88 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: 88"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost for the first 15 glasses (since the second glass is 60% of the price of the first glass) and the 16th glass.

The cost of the first 15 glasses is 15 * $5 = $75.
The cost of the 16th glass is $3.

The total cost is $75 + $3 = $78.

The final answer is: $78"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file and the time it takes to restart the download:
40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes + 60 minutes = 140 minutes.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts:

1. The first 3 hours at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. The 2 hours of standstill traffic:
Since he didn't move, the distance is 0 miles.

3. The half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. The remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Now, we add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

So, John is 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (5 hours, since she worked 45 hours in total), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost of $90.

$90 / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential profit: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
Total value at the end of the month: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential profit: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
Total value at the end of the month: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the jewelry will increase by $125 and the electronic gadgets will increase by $96, the jewelry will result in a higher profit. 

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit. 

The final numerical answer is: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
$20/hour * 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000

Her annual salary from coaching: 
$30/hour * 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500

Total annual salary: 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to complete the 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour on the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 8 miles per hour

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When you spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of water to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 46/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

The final answer is 16.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add up the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need: 
60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then add the distance from his second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance before the second stop = Total distance - Distance traveled before the first stop
= 60 miles - 20 miles
= 40 miles

Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = Distance to the end - Distance from the second stop
= 60 miles - 15 miles
= 45 miles

Now, we add the distance before the second stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip to find the total distance between the first and second stops.
Total distance between the first and second stops = Distance before the second stop + Distance from the second stop to the end
= 40 miles + 45 miles
= 85 miles

"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: 94"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms: 18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages:
Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate each person's guess and then find the average.

The first person says 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses together and divide by 3: 
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Since he spent $30 on video games, he must have had $30 initially. 

To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we need to divide the initial amount by the price of each Lego set. 

$30 / $15 = 2.

So, John initially had 2 Lego sets."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach.

1200 - 1000 = 200

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight of the bag to find out the total weight: 0.8 servings * 300g/serving = 240g.

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, net profit = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

The net profit is -$160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

80 + 220 = 300

However, she had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since she initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243.

243"
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). 

200 / 40 = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of units in the building. 

First, we find the total number of units: 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units.

Then, we calculate 3/4 of the total units: 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

Since the remaining units are unoccupied, we subtract the occupied units from the total units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- 6 truck tires at $60 each will be 6 * $60 = $360
- 4 car tires at $40 each will be 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- 12 car tires at $40 each will be 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday is $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days. 
$520 (Thursday) is greater than $480 (Friday), so Thursday had higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so we subtract 2 from 30:
30 - 2 = 28

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops (28) by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops in each bag.

28"

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid.
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = approximately 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the total number of gems: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups per year.

The total amount of dog food used in a year is 180 cups (first 180 days) + 730 cups (rest of the year) = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags.

So, Cecilia will use approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to calculate the cost of buying 3 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 3 * $2.50 = $7.50

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the worse option.
Savings = $7.50 - $9 = -$1.50

However, since we can't have negative savings, we need to re-evaluate the options. Let's recheck the calculation.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Cost = 6 packages of 3 flowers each = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Cost = 9 packages of 2 flowers each = 9 * $1 = $9

"To find the number of games won, we need to know the number of games lost. Since they won 8 more than they lost, let's denote the number of games lost as x. 

The number of games won would be x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the games won and lost is 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost is 7, we can find the number of games won:

Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Since there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Since there are 5 children, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 
Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds
38 = Gerald's time + 2

Now, we need to find Gerald's original time. 
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 36 seconds.
10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds

Now, we add the 10% improvement to Gerald's original time to find his new time.
Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is 39.6."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, we need to multiply the final volume of the sauce by 2.

32 ounces (final volume) * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used.

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day. We know he has 4 more days to complete the remaining 24 pages.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 1 * 5 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water per day, so that's 2 glasses per weekend.

Now, let's add the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:
5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 7

So, John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. To do that, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate:
90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, she would have taken on 3 sets * 2 liters/set = 6 liters of water.

The time it took her to row 3 sets of 20 feet is 3 sets * 16 seconds/set = 48 seconds. Since the question asks for the time it took her to reach the shore, we need to add the time it took her to row 20 feet to the time it took her to row 3 sets of 20 feet. However, the question already states that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can ignore the additional time.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons per day and multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6 to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we can divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

Number of ducks = 300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
New selling price = $180 + (50% of $180) 
= $180 + $90 
= $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

"To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to calculate 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago and subtract it from Adrien's salary.

Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
30% of Adrien's salary four years ago = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago - 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40% from four years ago, we can calculate it as follows:

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
= $40,000 + 0.4 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000

Now, we can find Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% of her salary four years ago to her salary four years ago:

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
= $28,000 + 0.4 * $28,000

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in that pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile.

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We know that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.

Female Scottish unicorns = Scottish unicorns * 2/3
Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * 2/3
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The answer is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, and there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can start by finding the number of queens. 

Let's assume the number of queens is Q. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. The sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, in 14 hours he would earn 14 * 10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the tax on non-food items first. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. 

The total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

The tax on non-food items is 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar.

The total cost of non-food items including tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The total cost of everything is 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is 16."
"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. He has 3 clients now and 5 potential clients, so he will have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of the bottles of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of the packs of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total income to find the profit: 
$92 (total income) - $72 (total expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. So, in the first 18 hours, 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees have left the hive.
5. Since 105 bees have left, and 15 of them returned in the first 6 hours, 105 - 15 = 90 bees are still outside the hive.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. So, 90 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she gave the cashier:

Total amount given - change = cost of tickets
Let's say the total amount given is x.
x - 8 = 22
x = 22 + 8
x = 30

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The seagull ate 7 fries, so the remaining fries are 14 - 7 = 7.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are 7 - 9 = -2. However, since we can't have negative fries, we need to re-evaluate the situation. Let's assume the problem meant that the pigeons ate 3 fries each, but the remaining fries after the seagull ate were 7. Then, the pigeons ate 3 fries, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

The rolls are 4 inches long, and there are 300 of them. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12. 
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The chocolate croissants are 6 inches long, and there are 120 of them. 
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are 2 feet long, and there are 60 of them. 
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths of all the baked goods together. 
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet.

100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
She does this 34 times. 
180 yards * 34 = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is: 
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3. 
24 * 2/3 = 48/3 = 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of an action figure as follows:
3 action figures = 1 doll
3 action figures = 1 red car
1 action figure = 1/3 of a red car
1 action figure = 1/3 * $4 = $1.33

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each toy:
- 5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures = 3 * $1.33 = $4
- 1 doll = 1 * $4 = $4

The total cost of all toys is $20 + $4 + $4 = $28."
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Now we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first find out how much money Ethel has, which is given as $8. 

Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we can calculate Jimmy's money as follows:

Jimmy's money = 2 * Ethel's money + 2
Jimmy's money = 2 * 8 + 2
Jimmy's money = 16 + 2
Jimmy's money = 18

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The final answer is: 1210"
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays each month, we need to add the minimum payments for all her debts and then multiply by 1.5 (since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum).

Minimum payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we multiply the total by 1.5:
$1000 * 1.5 = $1500

To find the yearly amount, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes)

Now, we multiply the time to prepare one potato by the total number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111 or 11.11%

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. 

Difference = 50% - 11.11% = 38.89%

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 38.89% more than rolling two even numbers in a row."

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since the straw is distributed equally among the rats, we divide the remaining straw by 6 (the number of straw pieces per rat): 90 / 6 = 15

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we divide the total number of rats by 3: 15 / 3 = 5

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, we know the total cost and the total revenue. We can find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

However, this is the total number of bags bought, not sold. Since the trader sold 13 bags, we can find the number of bags bought by dividing the number of bags sold by the number of bags sold per batch:
Number of bags bought = Number of bags sold / Number of bags per batch
Number of bags bought = 13 / 1
Number of bags bought = 13

The trader bought 13 bags."

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the number of trees he planted and the number of trees he chopped down over the 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so over 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so over 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

= 6277

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, since he edits an equal number for both publishers. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings before the award would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's add the award amount of $5000 to his total earnings:

104,000 + 5000 = 105,000

So, John's total earnings for the year would be $105,000.

Final answer: 105,000"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each type of bag and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue pens: 
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens: 
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of green pens, blue pens, and red pens together: 
22 green pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 88 pens

Janet now has 88 pens."
"To find the average of the six tests, we need to first find the total score of the first five tests. 

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To get an average of 93, the total score of the six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.

Since the total score of the first five tests is 438, the score of the sixth test should be 558 - 438 = 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought, we need to add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   The cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 for each babysitting job and $4 for each lawn mowing job. To find out how many babysitting jobs she needs to do, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting job ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting jobs.

To find out how many lawn mowing jobs she needs to do, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing job ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing jobs.

So, Sara needs to do 15 lawn mowing jobs to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w = 42.

Now, we can substitute w = r + 2 into the equation 3r + 5w = 42. This gives us 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32.

Divide both sides by 8: r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time spent walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it now has 4x - 16 gallons.

We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can set up the equation:

4x - 16 = 4(x + 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x - 16 = 4x + 64

Subtracting 4x from both sides:

-16 = 64

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago is incorrect. However, we can still solve the problem.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay back is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since Janeth will be paying $165 per month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on Harriet's age.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the four students: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately.

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. 
A third of that amount is 15000 / 3 = 5000. 
So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years: 
15000 + 5000 = 20000.

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos' cost: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards, so the new total is:
90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new total is:
82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
He had 40 water type cards initially and lost 8, so the new number of water type cards is:
40 - 8 = 32

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"To find the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat is $2.00.
Extra cheese is $1.00.
Avocado is $1.00.
2 sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The upgrade is $3.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: 
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find out how many minutes it will take for them to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate the total number of pieces they can place per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we can divide 360 by 6 to find the total number of minutes it will take to complete the puzzle: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

The answer is 1. 

Final numerical answer: 1"
"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial 36 watermelons from the total.

120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons.

3/4 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total.

84 - 63 = 21

The answer is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for 12 cars is 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

The total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to know that there are half as many bugs as ants. Since there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs. 

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, the total number of penguins that leave is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced per vine.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza. 

There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices, so the total number of slices needed is 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we need to divide 80 slices by 8 slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas John needs. 

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to James' candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has: 
54 / 2 = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's amount:
27 + 6 = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:
54 - 33 = 21

"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class
= 30 students

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is:

15 + 12 = 27 girls

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

30 - 27 = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls, so the number of boys in these two classes is:

30 - 27 = 3 boys

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in the third class is:

3 boys / 2 classes = 1.5 boys

Since we can't have a fraction of a boy, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 1.5 boys could be 1 boy and 1.5 students who are not boys, or 1 boy and 1 girl and 1.5 students who are not boys."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
10 wolves (last night) + 45 wolves (today) = 55 wolves
15 cougars (last night) + 12 cougars (today) = 27 cougars

Total number of animals killed = 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. 
4 * 21 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and adds them to the existing 20 stalls. So, the total number of cows in the 20 stalls is 20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) = 60 cows.

Now, we divide the total number of cows (60) by the number of stalls (20) to find out how many cows are in each stall: 60 / 20 = 3 cows per stall.

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall (3) by 8: 3 * 8 = 24 cows.

The answer is 24."

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to 44:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing 48 by 2:
48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:
52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 100

The total number of fruits is 100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find out how much more it is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000
Net proceeds: $400,000 - $368,000 = $32,000

The final answer is: $32,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Now, let's add up the time: 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$75 * 15 = $1125

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

The answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the total number of M&Ms: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we need to multiply that by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows.

12 windows (bedrooms) + 8 windows (additional) = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the prices of the items together.

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounding to the nearest dollar) = $15.99

The total cost is $15.99. 

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

The cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines from each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines are Sean's, he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is 2/5 * 80 = 32.
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48.
3. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is 1/2 * 48 = 24.
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24.
5. 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is 5/8 * 24 = 15.
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9.
7. The number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, we can represent their current ages as x and 20-x.

In 10 years, their ages will be x+10 and (20-x)+10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x+10) + (20-x+10) = 30 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 15 + 30 = 45 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in each necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in both weeks:
Alani's stories: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's stories: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's stories: 60 + 120 = 180

Total number of stories: 60 + 120 + 180 = 360

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years.

Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8. 

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 39 = (1/10)x

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 10: 
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83."

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."

"To calculate the total miles driven per year, we need to calculate the miles driven per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a year.

Miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles (to and from work) = 60 miles
Miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is:
Total bonus = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person eats in a week and then add them up.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Cera was half as old as Noah, we can set up an equation to find Noah's age six years ago. Let's call Noah's age six years ago 'x'. Since Cera was half as old as Noah six years ago, we can write the equation: 
   46 - 6 = (1/2)x
   40 = (1/2)x
   x = 80

So, Noah was 80 years old six years ago.

2. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can set up an equation to find the population of Chile six years ago:
   Population six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population six years ago = 3000 * 80
   Population six years ago = 240000

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up an equation to find the current population of Chile:
   Population six years ago = (1/2) * Current population
   240000 = (1/2) * Current population
   Current population = 240000 * 2
   Current population = 480000

The final answer is: 480000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 
Now, the total number of marbles is 20 + 8 = 28.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

56"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of sets of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since there is 1 electric pole for every 3 electric wires, there are 15 electric poles. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the beginning, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 

1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men. 

Number of men who left = 1/4 of 40 = 10

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 10 = 15

Since 15 men stayed, and we know that 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is 22 - 15 = 7.

Therefore, 7 women are left at the party.

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46.

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3
x = -7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense)

However, let's re-examine the problem. We can assume that the 26 pencils are the total number of pencils Jam has, and Meg has 46 pencils. We can set up the equation:
26 + 46 = total number of pencils
72 = total number of pencils

Since we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, we can set up the equation:
3x + 2 = 26 (we can ignore the 46 pencils for now)
3x = 24
x = 8

Now, we know that each box has 8 pencils. We can find the total number of boxes needed:
Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of boxes is 3 + 1 = 4.

The total number of boxes needed is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for each new one, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each new record was obtained by trading 2 old records, we multiply the number of new records by 2.

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 
There were 20 people heading to the third stop, and 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 20 - 7 = 13.

Therefore, 13 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they got 4 rewards. 

The rewards are $1 off for every $20, so 4 rewards would be 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the total amount spent: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15

- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his time was spent sightseeing. We can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 40%:

Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, so we need to add her earnings to her initial savings:
$275 + $80 = $355

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $355 = $45

Annabelle still needs $45 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.

She also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget.

$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming she doesn't charge her friends for the activities), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend.

$60 ÷ $0 = $60

However, this is not possible, as we can't divide by zero. This means that Morgan can't invite any friends with the given budget, or she would have to charge her friends for the activities."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left from his original $10. This means he spent $10 - $2 = $8 on candy.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount he spent on candy ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$8 ÷ $1.5 = 5.33 pounds

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"To find the son's age, let's denote the son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can set up the equation: 
2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 675.

18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

Time taken to reach his friend's house: Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours
Time taken for the detour: 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours
Time taken to return home: 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken: 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The trip took approximately 5 hours and 59 minutes. 

The final answer is: 5.99"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

The final answer is 87."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.
Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points: 42
Points scored so far: 15 + 18 = 33

Now, subtract the points scored so far from the total required points:
42 - 33 = 9

So, Jane needs at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   So, 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   So, 3 * 7 = 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence over goods on sale is 7 + 21 = 28.
5. Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 28 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Sara's points before scoring 8 as follows:

Let Sara's points before scoring 8 be x. 
Then, Erin's points before scoring 14 will be 3x.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before scoring 8.

Now, to find Erin's points before scoring 14, we multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before scoring 14 = 3 * 4.67
Erin's points before scoring 14 = 14

However, this is not possible since Erin scored 14 points. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Erin scored 14 points, then Sara scored 14 / 3 = 4.67 points. But we can't have a fraction of a point. 

Let's try again. If Erin scored 14 points and Sara scored 8 points, then Erin has three times more points than Sara. We can set up the equation:

14 = 3 * 8 + y

where y is the points Erin scored before scoring 14.

14 = 24 + y

Subtract 24 from both sides:

-10 = y

So, Erin scored -10 points before scoring 14. This doesn't make sense, as you can't score negative points.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
   So, the total cost for etching the logo is $4 per frame. 
   Total cost for picture frames with etching: $880 + $4 = $884

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add up the costs:
$884 (picture frames with etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords for officers) = $1026

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan made his own, he saves 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the materials is $400 - $80 = $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper. 

Total cost = $320 (materials) + $400 (original wallpaper) = $720."

3. On the last day, they sold one-half the amount from the previous day, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total: 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice, we need to add up the hours for each day.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, 40% of x is the number of faulty pieces. 

0.4x = number of faulty pieces

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, and this is the cost of all the pieces, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = x * cost per piece

We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / x

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for the number of faulty pieces:

0.4x = x * (400,000 / x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.4x = 400,000

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get:

x = 1,000,000

So, the total number of pieces is 1,000,000.

Now, we can find the number of faulty pieces:

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4x
= 0.4 * 1,000,000
= 400,000

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 1,000,000 - 400,000
= 600,000

The cost of functioning pieces is the total amount spent minus the cost of faulty pieces. We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / 1,000,000
= 0.4

Now, we can find the cost of functioning pieces:

Cost of functioning pieces = number of functioning pieces * cost per piece
= 600,000 * 0.4
= 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, Mary collects 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pupils like yellow, we first need to find out how many pupils like blue and how many like green.

Half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we need to divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday, and she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday, she picked 2 * 14 = 28 apples on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 28 (Wednesday) = 54 apples

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, so 10 pairs is 10 x 2 = 20 socks. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
Total amount = $3,650 + (10% of $3,650)
Total amount = $3,650 + $365
Total amount = $4,015

Since Karan has to pay for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $4,015 / 5
Monthly payment = $802

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $802."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances they hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The answer is 67."
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 girls + 26 boys = 52 members.

Half of the people can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 52 / 2 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people who can make it. 

The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29."

"To find out how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. 
20% of $10 is $2, so he saves $2 per month on each of the two services. 
The total savings on the two services is $2 + $2 = $4 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $4 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $14 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month. 

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 - $14 = $46 per month.

So, Tim saves $46 per month by cancelling his cable package."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 1.5 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100:

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

Mark earns $10 per day, so we can divide the bike cost by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to work to save for the bike.

$300 (bike cost) ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

However, Mark is short $250, so he would need to work for 30 days and then have some money left over. 

To find out how much money Mark will have after 30 days, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days:

$10 (daily earnings) x 30 (days) = $300

Since Mark already has $50, he will have a total of $50 + $300 = $350 after 30 days. This means he will have enough money to buy the bike after 30 days of work.

Mark needs to work for 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of milk per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week = 1600 hours
Total amount paid in May = 1600 hours * $15/hour = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.
Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week = 1200 hours

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and then multiply it by the percentage of those that explode (which is also 5%).

First, let's find the number of candles with the defect:
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Since 5% of these candles also explode, we multiply the number of candles with the defect by 5% (or 0.05):
2500 * 0.05 = 125 candles

So, 125 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price.
Discounted price = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:

3x + 60 + (number of apples gathered from average trees) = 500

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as y. Since Joanne gathers y apples from the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the average trees is y + 0 = y.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

3x + 60 + y = 500

We know that the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

3x + 60 + 440 - 3x = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

400 = 500

This is not possible, so we need to re-examine our steps. Let's re-evaluate the number of apples gathered from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the average trees is y. Since Joanne gathers y apples from the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

3x + 60 + 440 - 3x = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

400 = 500

This is still not possible, so let's re-evaluate the number of apples gathered from the average trees.

Let's re-examine the information given in the problem. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350.

Since Joanne gathers y apples from the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

y + 0 = 350

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation based on the number of bumps:

2C + D = 304 (since each camel contributes 2 bumps and each dromedary contributes 1 bump)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and each animal has one head. So, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations:

2C + D = 304
C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first one:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation. 

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: $4000 * 2 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is 30 * 3/5 = 18.
4. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: $8 per month
   6 months * $8 per month = $48

2. The next 8 months: $12 per month
   8 months * $12 per month = $96

3. The last 8 months: $14 per month
   8 months * $14 per month = $112

Now, let's add up the costs of all three periods:
$48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total savings from the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the remaining 2/3 of the savings must have come from the tattered jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the sale price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22. 

The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * ($22 - x). 

The total savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * $6. 

Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * ($22 - x) + 2/3 * $6 = $6

Simplifying the equation, we get:
(22 - x) + 4 = 6
22 - x = 2
x = 20

The original price of the jogger jeans is $20. 

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28. 

The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $28 - $20 = $8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4.
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.
The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he's going to the amusement park, that means he has $50 from the sale of his cards.

We know that he sells the cards for $1.5 each and he keeps 1/3 of them. This means he sells 2/3 of his cards. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. 

Since he sells 2/3 of his cards for $1.5 each, the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5. We know that this amount is equal to $50.

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, divide both sides by $1.5:

x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. Since the caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, that means he had enough hotdogs for 18 * 2 = 36 guests. 

Since 40 guests showed up, and the caterer had enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have two hotdogs, that means 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $132."
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount of money he had left: 1% of $5 is $0.05. So, he had $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 left.

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars. We subtract the amount he had left from the total amount he spent: $5 - $4.95 = $0.05.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars ($0.05) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents) to find out how many candy bars he bought: $0.05 / 0.75 = 0.0667. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they are on sale for $2.00 a box. So, the cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1."

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $1 extra. So, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $21 + $2 = $23.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda is $23 - $12 = $11.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $11 - $3 = $8.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed = 320 / 2 = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost = 160 * 12 = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob will be $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the total number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. Half of the fairies from the east joined the ones already there, so 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined, making the total 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
3. 30 fairies flew away, so we subtract 30 from 75, which is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add Jennifer's puppies and Brandon's puppies. 

Jennifer's puppies: 8
Brandon's puppies: 12
Total puppies: 8 + 12 = 20

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's puppies with spots: 3
Brandon's puppies with spots: 4
Total puppies with spots: 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we'll divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4300 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
4300 / 2250 = 1.9133 (round up to 2 since you can't make a fraction of a trip)

The farmer needs to make 3 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we need to calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's total. 

60% of 10 plants is 0.6 * 10 = 6. 

Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we subtract 7 from Toni's total. 

Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given away (300) by 10 to find the number of students: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. 9 - 8 = 1.

The difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky is 1 dollar."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room: 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items per room by 80: 15 * 80 = 1200

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

He starts with 200 shoes.
On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 200 + 5 = 205 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, so he now has 205 + 15 = 220 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, so he now has 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.
On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so he now has 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

The final answer is 70."
"To find out how many cupcakes Mary needs to bake, we need to multiply the number of jars of sprinkles by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books.

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books per child

So, each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we need to subtract the kids allergic to both, since they were counted twice: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to anything from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

Total number of people going on the tour: 600 (employees) + 7 (tour guides) = 607

The final answer is: 607"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors. 

The total cost of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. So, the total cost is $4.00.

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors, we divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, so we add her height to the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add the heights of all the layers together: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Total cost = 6 * $12.00
Total cost = $72.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. 
So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the total number of animals in both places: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To find the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to reach his goal. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days. 

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days: 
105,000 calories / 183 days ≈ 576 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. In a week, he would earn 30 * 7 = $210.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

90,000"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the amount each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the quarts each person can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."

Original daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since half a house takes 5 days).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10/5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has by adding 2 to the number of sofas she has. 

20 (sofas) + 2 = 22 chairs

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3 to find the number of chairs Jenna has.

22 (Ophelia's chairs) * 3 = 66 chairs

Now, we can find the total number of chairs by adding Ophelia's and Jenna's chairs.

22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88 chairs

To find the total number of sofas, we can simply add the number of sofas Ophelia has to the number of sofas Jenna has. However, we don't know how many sofas Jenna has. We know that they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since we know Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs she has.

66 (Jenna's chairs) - 2 = 64 sofas

Now, we can find the total number of sofas by adding Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas.

20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84 sofas

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 more passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jame's current age as J. 

In 5 years, Jame will be J + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (J + 5) + 5 = J + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

J + 10 = 2 * (J + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

J + 10 = 2J + 10 - 5
J + 10 = 2J + 5
10 - 5 = 2J - J
5 = J

Now that we know Jame's current age is 5, we can find the age of his cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 + 8 = 13 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 13 - 5 = 8 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer from the total to find the cost of the two monitors. 
$2,400 - $1,100 = $1,300

Since there are two monitors, we divide the cost of the two monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. 
$1,300 / 2 = $650

The cost of one monitor is $650."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 
300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the total vlogs she wants to make.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families notified in each round and then add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find twice the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Then we add 2 minutes to that:
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his total weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 
So, his weekly earnings are 2 * 5 * 4 = $40.

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide $80 by $40:
$80 / $40 = 2 weeks.

The answer is 2."
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost = $40 + $120 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons. Since these buttons have four holes each, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5. 

5 - 4 = 1

The answer is 1."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

The total number of rodents is 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the new angle.

The sun moves 5 degrees an hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 32 - 50
New angle = -18 degrees

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle.

New angle = -18 + 360
New angle = 342 degrees

However, the angle cannot be greater than 180 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the new angle from 180 to get the correct angle.

New angle = 180 - 342
New angle = -162 degrees

Again, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle.

New angle = -162 + 360
New angle = 198 degrees

The final angle of the sun relative to the ground is 198 degrees."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs. Since the younger son is 8 years old, he will need 8 candles. The older son is 12 years old, so he will need 12 candles. 

In total, James needs 8 + 12 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many packs James needs. 20 / 5 = 4.

So, James needs 4 packs of candles. 4 packs will cost 4 x $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find out the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we need to add the pages she read in the first week and the second week.

70 + 100 = 170

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with Richie's score. 

Since Richie scored 80 goals and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's score by subtracting 20 from Richie's score: 
80 - 20 = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's score, we subtract 45 from Richie's score: 
80 - 45 = 35

Now that we know the scores of all three teenagers, we can add them up to find the total number of goals scored:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175

The total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * 4 = $84

Since Liam made $63, we need to subtract this from the amount Mitchell made to find the difference.

Difference = Total amount Mitchell made - Total amount Liam made
= $84 - $63
= $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of $5 * 3 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $55 left, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 3 + 27 = 30."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, in 1 year (12 months), she removes 12 * $100 = $1200.

In 2 years, she removes 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Initially, Katina had $3000 in her account. After removing $2400, she will have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.

The final amount remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is $600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The net profit of the food truck is $37.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is 36."

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5: (20 + (20/2)) / 5
   First, calculate half of 20: 20/2 = 10
   Then, add 10 to 20: 20 + 10 = 30
   Finally, divide 30 by 5: 30 / 5 = 6
3. The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12)
   First, subtract 12 from 20: 20 - 12 = 8
   Then, multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to add 4% to the set temperature to get the correct temperature. 

First, we find 4% of 520: 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

Now, we add 20.8 to 520: 
520 + 20.8 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees. 

The final answer is 540.8."

= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we'll calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we'll divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than Mark's window height of 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we can multiply the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms by the amount of mushrooms John eats per day (200 grams) to get the amount of protein he gets per day: 
0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the amount of protein John gets per day by 7 to get the amount of protein he gets per week: 
6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds in 1 hour.

Since they worked for 12 hours, we need to calculate the amount of chocolates each of them made in 12 hours.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 12 hours, he makes 120 * 6 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 90 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 1080 = 1800 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven in a month to find the total rotations per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

To find the total rotations in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

Cost per pump = $0.20 / 60 washings = $0.00333 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: 
$0.00333 * 100 = 0.33 cents per pump.

The final answer is 0.33."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply that by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost for Lewis' street: $194 * 490 = $95,060

Since the question asks how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

Cost for Monica's street: $194 * 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so 8 ounces of meat.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $600.

Let's assume he misses x classes. The total cost will be:
$60 + $10 * (10 - x)

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to $600.

$60 + $10 * (10 - x) ≤ $600
$60 + $100 - $10x ≤ $600
$160 - $10x ≤ $600
-$10x ≤ $440
x ≥ -44

Since Manny can't miss a negative number of classes, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 0.

However, the question asks how many classes he can miss before his parents won't sign him up again. This implies that he can miss some classes, but not all 10. 

So, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 9.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary is his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

The final answer is: $372000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 10 suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.
The cost of 10 dress pants is 10 * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500.
The cost of 10 dress shirts is 10 * $60 = $600.

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600.

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley biked 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

Since the final price paid on Tuesday ($398) is less than the final price paid on the next day ($540), the difference is negative."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of the green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, the sales of red hats can be represented as G/2.

We know that the total sales of red hats in the first month is $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 800

Now that we know the sales of green hats, we can calculate the total sales of the first month:

Total sales of the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month can be calculated as:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales of the first month
= 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, we can calculate the total amount she made in two months:

Total amount in two months = Total sales of the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's wage was overpaid by $120."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of whole eggs.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

24 whole eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

So, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 minutes is 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 
The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers. 

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We know that the final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, the total number of siblings is 5. 

So, the equation can be written as: 
x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:
3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:
3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet's age, which is 7 years. 

The age of the older twin would be 7 + 7 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap: 
180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10: 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

To find the total cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of one candy by 10: 
10 candies * $3.20 = $32.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost: 
$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in 10 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 * 10 = 120 months in 10 years. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 10 years, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In 10 years, Neil saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have, we need to add the coins saved by Rong and Neil. 

Total coins = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. 
0.6x = 60

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.6.
x = 60 / 0.6
x = 100

The total bill is $100. The cost of the vaccines is $40. 
$100 - $40 = $60

John brought $125. He leaves with $125 - $60 = $65."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

Red squares: 14
Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Total number of squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to find the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get 40 regular chairs.

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to get the total number of chairs needed: 8 + 40 = 48.

Since there are already 8 high chairs, we subtract 8 from 48 to find out how many more chairs Mia needs: 48 - 8 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"To find out how many points the class has, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Tom + Marta = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of children of each generation.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Since we are asked to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city display and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 more friends they meet at the cinema. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends
Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.

Total number of drinks = 2 * Total number of people
Total number of drinks = 2 * 20
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = 3 * Total number of people
Total number of snacks = 3 * 20
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks.

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * $2
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * $2
Total cost of snacks = 60 * $2
Total cost of snacks = $120

Total cost of drinks and snacks = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $80 + $120
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $200

"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry and then determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount of gravel Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total.

4,000 (Gissela's truck) + 4,800 (Gordy's truck) = 8,800 pounds

Now, subtract 8,800 from 11,600 to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry.

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much he initially received. 

Since the total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5, and Gerald received 3 parts, we can calculate his share as follows:

Gerald's share = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:

Gerald's remaining money = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. 

Let's assume the total percentage of the river's water used by the city is x. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can set up the equation:

80% of x = 40%

To solve for x, we can convert the percentages to decimals and divide both sides by 0.8:

0.8x = 0.4

x = 0.4 / 0.8
x = 0.5

Now that we know the total percentage of the river's water used by the city, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 100%:

100% - 80% = 20%

So, 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 20"

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of the croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of the cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of the mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final bill is $45.00."
"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she has $6.00, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops for free. 

So, she can buy 2 scoops for free and 2 scoops at $1.50 each, which is a total of 4 scoops.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since we can't have a negative amount, this means that Ron actually loses $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.33 x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 people, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all 5 people: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now we solve for x: 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, multiply the number of adults by the number of smores each adult wants: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.

Now, add the total number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, let's add their ages together: 
Dora's age + her father's age + her mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, so 2 x 2 = 4 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: weighs twice as much as the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds.

17"
"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.
90 - 87 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we add 6 to Steven's total. 

10 + 6 = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. 

Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. 

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark found 2 cards worth $4000 and $1000, so the total value of these cards is $5000. 

There are 30 more cards worth $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark found is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50 per day

To find out how much he saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:
$50 per day * 7 days = $350 per week

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 5 students per group.

Now, we need to find the total number of groups needed. 
54 students / 5 students per group = 10.8 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 11 groups.

To find the number of groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed from the total number of groups required. 
12 groups (already formed) - 10 groups (required) = 2 groups.

Therefore, 2 more groups are needed to form."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.
The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to know the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
He played 1 match on Friday.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation 'x'. 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to first find out how many people think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 34 = 16.

Therefore, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up an equation to find the total number of puppies:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

To find the total earnings for the two days, we need to add the earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
$300 + $60 = $360

Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an additional $5. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the additional $5.

So, Tanya's total earnings for the two days would be $360.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= (400 - 160) * 10
= 240 * 10
= $2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

The Llesis family drove at 50 miles per hour. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

They hiked at 20 miles per hour for 1.5 hours. Distance = speed * time. 

Distance = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so Ava jumps on 8 + 8 = 16 enemies. Emma jumps on 16 - 8 = 8 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. 

Emma's score is 8 * 10 + 15 + (60 - 4) = 80 + 15 + 56 = 151 points.
Ava's score is 16 * 10 + 12 + (60 + 4) = 160 + 12 + 64 = 236 points.

The difference between their scores is 236 - 151 = 85 points.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For 2 days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). However, we can assume that some of the fish taken out were orange and some were white. Let's say x orange fish were taken out and (17 - x) white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) white fish. We are told that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 - x = -9 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

3 = -9 + 3x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, x = 4. This means that 4 orange fish were taken out and (17 - 4) = 13 white fish were taken out.

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After taking out 13 white fish, he had 4 - 13 = -9 white fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). However, we can assume that some of the fish taken out were white and some were orange. We already know that 4 orange fish were taken out.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent on lunch is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10 groups.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month.
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Then, multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
300 bottle caps * $0.25 = $75

"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours (11 - 8 = 3), her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

So, her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in the first month: 200 employees * $4000 = $800,000
Total amount paid in the second month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in the third month: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000

Total amount paid in three months: $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

The final answer is: $2,640,000"

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, let's add their scores together: 
278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428.

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides, we get:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7, we get:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 more hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them. 

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 
The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold. 
$900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 40 * 2 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per bag and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to find the length of the mosaic. To do this, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 inches.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first find out how many candies he has in total. 

Dale started with 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, he sold 150 candies, so he now has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

The answer is 50."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed.

Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower: 
- 3 - 1 = 2
- 4 - 1 = 3
- 5 - 1 = 4
- 6 - 1 = 5

Now, let's add the remaining number of petals for each type of flower: 
- 2 * 5 = 10
- 3 * 6 = 18
- 4 * 4 = 16
- 5 * 7 = 35

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 10 + 18 + 16 + 35 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Marshmallows dropped = 3

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Total S'mores = 17
Number of kids = 2

S'mores per kid = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

John can have 8 S'mores.
DeSean can have 8 S'mores.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he played 240 / 20 = 12 games.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so he played 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, he played 240 / 10 = 24 games.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so he played 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, he played 240 / 30 = 8 games.

The total number of games played is 12 (Jack) + 24 (worse friend) + 8 (better friend) = 44 games.

The cost per game is 1 quarter, which is $0.25. So the total cost is 44 * $0.25 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. After selling 8 cars, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

4. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

5. After giving away 16 cars, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students, we divide the amount from students by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day as follows:
Time on the second day = 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time she took to walk in the two days:
Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time in minutes = 720 minutes

2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we know she scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, let's add up the points Sasha scored in both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of cards each person has. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153."
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance traveled by the kangaroos is the same as the distance traveled by the turtles. We can set up an equation using the speed of the kangaroo and the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 108 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 27 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4.

Time = 27 hours * 4
Time = 108 hours

So, it will take 108 hours for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she also received $150 for her part-time job. Her mom agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 (since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop).

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 230 = 350.

Subtracting 230 from both sides, we get x = 120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces per day (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows needed.

5 cows - 3 cows = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length: (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 10 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length: (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 4 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length: (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 6 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills. 

Four $20 bills equal 4 * $20 = $80.

The hat costs $70, so the change Thea got is $80 - $70 = $10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent.

Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.
He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is $40. So, he has $40 - $21 = $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying Jack's socks by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add them together.
60 + 30 = 90 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. We can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing Jack's dishes by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add them together.
60 + 30 = 90 dishes

To find the total number of socks and dishes, we add the total number of socks and dishes together.
90 + 90 = 180"
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year: $2640
Number of pairs bought per year: 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the green food: 
3 baskets of green food * $25 per basket = $75

Then, calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:
3 baskets of red food * $18 per basket = $54
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the total cost of the red food:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add up the total number of homes built over the three years: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Then, my brother's age is x + 3, and my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of our ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. 
On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total.
10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80
Rafaela's tips: $800 - $80 = $720
Julieta's tips: $720 - $80 = $640

To find the total amount of tips, we need to add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges she bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. In a year, Amber earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Then, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20. So, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know that the carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller gave $4000 in total. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount given:
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, that means Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
Tobias ate 2/5 of 60 pieces, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36 pieces remaining.

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26 pieces remaining.

On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
To find 7/13 of 26, we multiply 26 by 7 and divide by 13: 
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.
26 - 14 = 12 pieces remaining.

So, Tobias has eaten 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours, so her hourly rate is $33 / 3 = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

3.33"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5 per meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total amount she has is:
20 meters * $2 per meter = $40

$40 - $30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To find Melanie's present age, we need to subtract 10 years from 18. 
Melanie's present age = 18 - 10 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 
Let's assume that in x years, her age will be thrice her present age. 
So, 8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be paired. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means 80% of the microphones can be paired. 

80% of 50 microphones is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the total number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20 pairs.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5 = 10

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100 plants. 
One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants.
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants.
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Whatchamacallit speed = 11 * Thingamabob speed

We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

121 = 11 * Thingamabob speed

To find the thingamabob speed, we can divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob speed, we can find the whirligig speed by multiplying it by 5:

Whirligig speed = 5 * Thingamabob speed
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We can subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

$11 (total) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2.

$2 / 2 = $1

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 13 * 6 = 78
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * 13 * 6 = 234
- Alba's lawn: 5 * 13 * 6 = 390

Total amount from mowing lawns: 78 + 234 + 390 = 702

Now, let's subtract the total amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $702 = -$622

However, this is not possible since she made a positive amount. This means our initial assumption that she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, and Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, we can set up the equation:

3x = 5x - x
3x = 4x
x = 0

This means she didn't mow Joe's lawn at all. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 0 times. And since she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 0 times.

The only remaining option is that she mowed Joe's lawn once, and the rest of the $80 came from lemonade sales.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the amount she earned from lemonade sales is:
$80 - $6 = $74

The final answer is: 74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
$750 - $500 = $250

So, John's monthly profit is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 
3x = 7, where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3, which is approximately 2.33. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks for Joseph.

Now, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2 notebooks. 
7 - 2 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the distance Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance and add it to Dijana's distance. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 10 miles.

Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's compare their total pages:
Denise's total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages
Daniel's total: 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 8 bowls (since it can fill 4 adult bowls). 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 5 people. Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, we can divide 8 by 5 to find out how many bowls each person can have for dinner. 

8 / 5 = 1.6 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 1 bowl per person for dinner. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls are left for lunch. 

5 people had 1 bowl each for dinner, so 5 bowls were used. 

8 - 5 = 3 bowls left 

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the remaining 3 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl for lunch. 

3 / 2 = 1.5 

Again, we can't have a fraction of a bowl, so we'll round down to 1 bowl per child for lunch."

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, let's subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 

7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (blue shoe boxes used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes and subtract that from the total number of red shoe boxes.

1/3 of 9 (red shoe boxes) is 3. 
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (red shoe boxes used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

4 + 6 = 10"
"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from 18. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books.

16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is 30 * 1/5 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write:

D = 60

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

60 = 2A

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we can add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To find the number of yellow balloons, we first need to find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find the number of yellow balloons, we divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 / 3 = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5 for 2, the cost of 12 balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) = $14.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $14 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. 

$28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The total number of students is 56."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):
24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday. 

60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are for mint tea. 

27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea) = 12 cups of mint tea.

Since she divides these into 3 rows, we need to divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3.

12 (mint tea cups) / 3 (rows) = 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips, which equals 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 
Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 
5000 gallons - (500 gallons * 6 days) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The answer is 2000."
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We don't know how many movies he's already seen, but we know he's already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday. Let's assume he's seen 5 movies on a Friday. If he's seen 5 movies on a Friday, he's already spent 5 * $10 = $50. If he's seen 5 movies on a Saturday, he's already spent 5 * $10 = $50. 

Since we don't know which day he's seen 5 movies, we'll consider both scenarios. 

Scenario 1: He's seen 5 movies on a Friday. He has $134 - $50 = $84 left. 
Scenario 2: He's seen 5 movies on a Saturday. He has $134 - $50 = $84 left.

In both scenarios, Colby has $84 left. Since tickets for any other day cost $7, we can calculate how many movies he can see with $84. 

$84 / $7 = 12 movies.

So, Colby can see 12 movies if he's seen 5 movies on a Friday or 12 movies if he's seen 5 movies on a Saturday."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

There are 5 days in total. 
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial 10 balloons to the 15 additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

They need 15 new tables.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The additional hours will cost 70 pesos per hour. So, 5 hours will cost 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron will be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost for a 24-hour stay would be 1600 pesos. 

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

"To find out how much James spent, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points. 
Bahati scored (x + 10) + 20 points. 

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 + 20) = 45

Combine like terms: 
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 5/3

Since x represents Dinar's points, Dinar scored 5/3 points. However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to 1 point for Dinar. 

Now, we can find Azibo's points: 
Azibo scored x + 10 points, which is 5/3 + 10 points. 
To add 10 to 5/3, we can convert 10 to 30/3. 
So, Azibo scored 5/3 + 30/3 = 35/3 points. 

To convert 35/3 to a whole number, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3. 
Azibo scored 35/3 * 3/3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3 = 35/3 * 3

"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.
900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.
60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep from 2:15 to 2:38 am. 
2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, we need to add those 5 minutes to the total time she was asleep. 
23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes

However, we also need to consider the time she usually sleeps. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We need to convert 8 hours into minutes. 
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time she was awake (28 minutes) from the total time she usually sleeps (480 minutes) to find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day. 
480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes

The final answer is: 452"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan also has 24 measuring cups. So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils.

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 100 + 700 = 800.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 1000
Total occupied beds = 800
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to her family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the remainder is 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3. 
Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each direction and then add them together.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in this direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird ends up back at her southern home, we can subtract the distance traveled north from the distance traveled south to find the total distance between the two homes:
300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: 
- Nani: 8 years
- Nani's brother: 16 years
- Nani's sister: 6 years

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

Carlton's team has 13 players, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total number of wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the initial number of boxes to find out how many boxes she had left.

240 - 4 = 236 boxes

Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, we need to find 1/4 of 236 boxes.

1/4 * 236 = 59 boxes

Now, we subtract the boxes she kept from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she sold.

236 - 59 = 177 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we multiply the number of boxes she sold by the number of oranges per box.

177 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 3540 oranges

The final answer is: 3540"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much money Tyler needs to buy the books, we need to add the costs of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook.

$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we need to divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total.

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's total from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (20 + 30)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 
So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday and 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 
So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 10 + 5 = 15.

To find the total earnings for gingerbread, we multiply the number of boxes sold by the cost per box: 
10 * 6 = 60
15 * 6 = 90
Total earnings from gingerbread = 60 + 90 = 150

To find the total earnings from apple pie, we multiply the number of boxes sold by the cost per box: 
11 * 15 = 165
Total earnings from apple pie = 165

Now, we add the total earnings from gingerbread and apple pie to find the total earnings for two days: 
150 + 165 = 315

The final answer is: 315"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside.

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

The price of the blue car is $100.
The price of the red car is $60.

The final answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we multiply 18 by 1/2 to get 9 pretzels a day.

Now, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply 9 pretzels a day by 7 days. 

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

The total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The final answer is: $70."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$500 per month / $1,000 per pair = 0.5 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of pairs she can buy in a year.

0.5 pairs per month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 degrees.

So, the net cooling effect is 6 - 12 + 2 = -4 degrees.

The final temperature is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 * 30 = x + 75 (since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years)

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. 

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can now write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.
8. Solving for W, we get: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount collected, not just Walter's contributions.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far.

Let's assume Walter's friend's contribution is $200. The total amount collected so far is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as the total amount collected so far, which is $2200. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices and then the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, let's say each kid gets a slice of size y. Then, each adult gets 2y.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2y + 4y = 6

Combine like terms: 6y = 6

Divide both sides by 6: y = 1

So each kid gets a slice of size 1, and each adult gets 2 slices.

Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices. The total number of slices is 6, so each adult gets 2/6 = 1/3 of the watermelon.

To find the percentage, multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes

The final answer is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the monthly cost, which is $480 - $480 = $0.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $0."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61920 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6192

"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the number of hours they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. 

450 - 220 = 230

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he actually spent more than he had. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money he had initially.

Since he initially had $10 and spent $10.25, he actually had $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. But since he can't spend a negative amount, we will consider the initial $10 he had.

Now, let's calculate how much he has left: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. Since he can't spend a negative amount, we will consider the initial $10 he had.

However, we can recalculate the total amount spent on other fruits:

Since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, we will consider the initial $10 he had. He can buy plums with the remaining money he had initially, which is $10. 

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money he had initially: $10 / $0.25 = 40.

However, this is not possible since he can't buy 40 plums with $10. We will recalculate the total amount spent on other fruits and subtract it from the initial $10.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time it takes to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

The number of guests remaining is now 61 + 30 = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

To find the total number of points she is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions.
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total amount earned from large stuffed animals. Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is y. Then, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12y.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y.

The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2y * 4 = 8y.

We know that the total amount earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine like terms:

20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

y = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

Number of small stuffed animals = 2y = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 
So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to get the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by the friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by the friends. So, the number of eggs the friends found is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

The final answer is 43,200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%. 

80%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 
150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses.

Melissa's daily earnings: 6 hours * $15 per hour = $90 per day
Melissa's total earnings for 3 days: $90 per day * 3 days = $270
Melissa's parking expenses for 3 days: $3 per day * 3 days = $9
Melissa's total expenses: $270 - $9 = $261
Melissa's hourly earnings after expenses: $261 / 18 hours (6 hours per day * 3 days) = $14.50 per hour

The final answer is: $14.50"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 
40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school, we need to find out how much he would have earned if he had worked during those 4 years. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money he would have earned if he had worked during college:
$25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income would be:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost while in school:
$100,000 (lost income) - $50,000 (loans) = $50,000

To find out how long it would take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost, we need to divide the total amount by his new income:
$50,000 / $75,000 = 0.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 0.67 years, or about 8 months, to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school."
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we multiply the length and width to find the area:
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 13000

The total population in South America is 13,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we can calculate the total hours worked in a day as follows:

1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of 24 hours = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we need to multiply the hours worked in a day by the number of days:

3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days
Total hours worked in 21 days = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008: 
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009: 
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * Depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,318
= $12,482

Year 2010: 
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * Depreciation rate)
= $12,482 - ($12,482 * 0.21)
= $12,482 - $2,618.82
= $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,863.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the number of books written in English and German.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt). 

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 
Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's total by 2 to find Silvia's total. 
Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by all three: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

James gets 80 emails a day, and 20% of those don't require a response. 
20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

So, the number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds of butter he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter needed (6) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3.

Since he gets one half off for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds. So, for 3 sets of 2 pounds, he will pay for 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter.

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is 25 + 7 = 32. She also invited 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

So, the total number of guests is 32 + 13 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is $125 (for the initial 20 guests) + $126 (for the additional guests) = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to calculate the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 of $60 is $15.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 of $60 is $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can also calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:
15 / 12 = 1.25 (which is 1 dozen and 3 extra roses)
1 dozen roses cost $15, so 3 extra roses cost $2
Total cost of roses = $15 + $2 = $17

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Now, let's subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money she has:
$25 - $17 = $8

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the remaining amount to quarters:
$8 / $0.25 = 32 quarters

Jenny will leave with 32 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Terry makes $162 in total."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. 

To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

80"
"To find the original price, we need to calculate 75% of the original price of $2000. 

75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500. 

Now, let's find the selling price, which is 120% of the price he bought it for. 

120% of $1500 = 1.2 * $1500 = $1800

The original price was $2000, and the selling price is $1800. 

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount = ((Original price - Selling price) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to 180 to get Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, we can divide the distance by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked back home, we need to double the time it took him to walk to the store:

Total Time = 2 x 1 hour
Total Time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we need to calculate 15% of 300. 
15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes sold, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold.
MTB bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold. We can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type of bike sold by its price and adding them together.

Total earnings = (150 * 450) + (45 * 250) + (105 * 500)
Total earnings = 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500
Total earnings = 131,250

The final answer is: 131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is 17.6875."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Since the velociraptors ate half of it, they ate x/2 kilograms.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms.

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 270 + 270 = 540

So, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda, we need to calculate the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed is the number of remaining shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

There is 1 shaken soda left out of a total of 4 sodas (2 unshaken and 2 shaken). 

The probability is 1/4 or 0.25, which is equivalent to 25%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, the number of days Billy is available to help is 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the total number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150 people.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00. She returned an item worth $15.00, so the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. The discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The discounted price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the items purchased is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00. Adding this to the new balance of $70.00, we get $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. We already know that the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Lauren saves $20,000 per year and spends $40,000 per year. This means she is in a deficit of $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate how much she needs to save in total.

Total savings needed for 20 years = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Since she is in a deficit of $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the time she needs to work to save the amount she needs, not the time she needs to work to cover the deficit. Since she is in a deficit, she needs to work more than 20 years to cover the deficit.

Let's recalculate the total amount she needs to cover the deficit:

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she is in a deficit of $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the time she needs to work to cover the deficit. To find the total time she needs to work, we need to add the 20 years she needs to save the amount she needs for retirement.

Total time = 20 years (to cover the deficit) + 20 years (to save for retirement) = 40 years.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4).

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But we know she had $2 left, so the $2 must be the amount she had after buying the books, not the amount she had before buying the books. 

This means that the $10 must be the amount she spent on the books. Since she bought 2 books, we can divide the amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students enrolled this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

60"
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times it blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 
So, the number of blinks per minute is 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. 
Time = Total blinks / Blinks per minute
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of each type of fish and the number of new fish Tate bought.

Initial male guppies: 4
Initial female guppies: 7
Initial male goldfishes: 3
Initial female goldfishes: 5

New male guppies: 2
New female guppies: 1
New male goldfishes: 2
New female goldfishes: 3

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's compare the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fishes: 8 + 8 = 16

To find the difference, subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
16 - 11 = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply the distance by 2. 

140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total round trip distance by 2.

280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

70 / 2 = 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10).

20 / 10 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation:
14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:
Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since 2 years have passed, we add 2 to his age 2 years ago:
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons since they are the same weight, so the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

Total weight of crayons and boxes = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the amount Valerie's brother earns, we need to multiply Valerie's salary by 2. 

Valerie's brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary
Valerie's brother's salary = 2 * 5000
Valerie's brother's salary = 10000

Now, we need to find their combined salary.
Combined salary = Valerie's salary + brother's salary
Combined salary = 5000 + 10000
Combined salary = 15000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary.
Mother's salary = 2 * combined salary
Mother's salary = 2 * 15000
Mother's salary = 30000

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they all have together.
Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

The final answer is: 40000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Let's say the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach is x minutes. Then, the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2x minutes.

We know that 2x = 40 minutes, so we can solve for x:

2x = 40
x = 40 / 2
x = 20 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, it takes her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Therefore, it takes her 20 / 2 = 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we can find the total time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time on sidewalk = 10 minutes
Time on beach = 20 minutes
Total time for 3 miles = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 30 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the amount of water in the second mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is x degrees. We also know that the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, we can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means that the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Since the amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce, we can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = -127

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, we can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we can multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

"To find the number of women on the bus initially, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total parts to find the value of one part: 84 / 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.

Now, we need to subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam invests $100, and each rock costs $5, so the total number of rocks he can buy is:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory:
60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks
Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost and the loss:
Total cost = 20 rocks * $5 = $100
Total revenue = $84
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue = $100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the maximum number of days among them.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a numerical value. One dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May (31 days) and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

Since there are 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, the total daily cost is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Since Carlos collected 5 more seashells than Jim, and Jim collected 27 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by adding 5 to Jim's total: 
27 + 5 = 32 seashells.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can divide Carlos' total by 2 to find out how many seashells Carrey collected:
32 / 2 = 16 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells:
27 (Jim) + 32 (Carlos) + 16 (Carrey) = 75 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:
75 / 3 = 25 seashells per person.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

The first song is 5 minutes, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 x $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, they don't need to produce any more bottles to meet the demand.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, that means 3/4 of 8 babies are wearing purple. 
3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.

Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we need to find 1/3 of 6.
1/3 * 6 = 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows, and 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows, we can assume that the remaining 1/3 of the purple wearers (which is 2) are not wearing bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 1/3 of the blue wearers. Since 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, 1/3 of 1/4 is 1/12. 
1/12 * 8 = 2/3 of the babies are wearing blue, which is 5.33 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a baby). 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
The probability is the number of babies wearing both purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows. 
Probability = 2/7 ≈ 0.286 (or 28.6%).

The final answer is 28.6."

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 x $3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 in total.

The final answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.
2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

To find the number of eggs still hidden, subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs:
36 (initial eggs) - 27 (eggs found) = 9 eggs

"To find the total number of apartments, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Since the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, we can write the equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

And the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much money Rissa was given. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

To find out how much money Rissa gave to her sister, we multiply 1/5 by 15 (the amount of money Rissa had initially). 
1/5 * 15 = 3

So, Rissa gave 3 dollars to her sister. 

Now, we know that Rissa had 15 dollars initially and gave 3 dollars to her sister. 
15 - 3 = 12

Rissa is left with 12 dollars. 

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money. Since Ronnie had 5 dollars initially and didn't give any money to her sister, Ronnie is left with 5 dollars.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + x = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, the amount of each color (red, white, and purple) is 3 pints. Since we want to find the amount of red paint used, the answer is:

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.2).

Number of pods in the new box = 100 * 1.2 = 120 pods

Now, we can divide the budget of $1 by the cost of one pod to find out how many cycles you can run.

Cost per pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12 = 8.33

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, you can run 8 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

2.25 = 0.20 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.25 / 0.20
x = 11.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The teacher will have 11 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = 1/4 * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Total number of students in the class = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7
= 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first calculate how many face masks Mike bought and then multiply that by 3 and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks.
Thrice as many as Mike is 5 * 3 = 15.
Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, so 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

James drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, then multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund will be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school * 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
6 cheese pizza slices + 4 pepperoni pizza slices = 10 slices per friend.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 slices per friend * 6 friends = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 
To find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per cheese pizza: 60 slices / 12 slices per cheese pizza = 5 cheese pizzas.

To find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza: 60 slices / 8 slices per pepperoni pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas.

Since you can't buy half a pizza, Kate will need to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas.

Kate needs to buy 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

5 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 13 pizzas.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 2 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 18 snowballs per hour. 

Time = Total snowballs / Net snowballs per hour
Time = 60 / 18
Time = 3.33 hours

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim back then, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was x. Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at that time would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation: 2x + (current age - x) = 28

Since we don't know the current age, let's assume the time passed is 't' years. So, John's age at the time of Digimon's release would be 28 - t.

Now, we can rewrite the equation: 2(28 - t) = 2x
Expanding the equation: 56 - 2t = 2x

We also know that John's age at the time of Digimon's release was twice Jim's age, so we can set up another equation: 2x = 28 - t

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and t.

From the second equation, we can express t as t = 28 - 2x.

Substituting t in the first equation: 56 - 2(28 - 2x) = 2x
Expanding the equation: 56 - 56 + 4x = 2x
Simplifying the equation: 4x = 2x
Subtracting 2x from both sides: 2x = 0
Dividing both sides by 2: x = 0

Now that we know x, we can find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release: 2x = 2(0) = 0

Since x is 0, it means Jim was 0 years old when Digimon was released. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The problem states that John is twice as old as Jim, but it doesn't specify the time frame. We can assume that the time frame is from the time of Digimon's release to the present.

Let's re-evaluate the problem: John is 28 now, and he was twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release. Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 28 - t

Expanding the equation: 2x = 2x
This equation is true for any value of x. However, we can use the fact that John is 28 now to find Jim's age.

Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2x + t

We know that t is the time that has passed since Digimon's release. Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2x + (28 - x)

Simplifying the equation: 28 = x + 28
Subtracting 28 from both sides: 0 = x

"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

So, they ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the previous day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 bandages. So, they had x - 16 + 100 - 50 = x + 34 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 34 = 78

Subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 44

So, the nurses started with 44 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair.

"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a single shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to find the amount of blood in a shark: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in a single shark by 10 to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is 1200."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the number of bottles of cognac John bought. Since he bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

The equation is: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To find out how many shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420 shells

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, so we need to calculate 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at each station.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

Total number of students = 10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

Time taken by 3 full groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes
Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 45 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken by 3 full groups + Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the total number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase can hold 45 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide 110 by 45.

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total revenue = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per sale = 20 sales
Total revenue = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

35"
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played in a year by the number of points she scored in each game, and then multiply the result by the number of years.

Number of games per year: 40

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.

Now, he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls it takes to get 15 customers, we can divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

15 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 15 * 25 = 375 calls

However, we also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get 15 cars, we can divide 15 by 1/2 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers).

15 cars / 1 car per 2 customers = 15 * 2 = 30 customers

Now, we have two different numbers of customers: 375 calls to get 15 customers, and 30 customers to get 15 cars. Since 375 is greater than 30, Jason would need to make more than 375 calls to get 15 customers. However, we can use the higher number of customers (30) to find the number of calls.

30 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 30 * 25 = 750 calls

So, Jason would need to make at least 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles and half have 5 medium candles. 

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 small candles per room, so that's 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 
For the other 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 5 medium candles per room, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people in the house. So, there are 4 flashlights.

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights: 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is 5. 

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find the total time, let's break down the time it takes to complete each side:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time to complete the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
20 * 2 = x
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
40 = (1/2) * 20
40 = 10

Now that we know there are 10 robots, 40 footballs, and 20 helmets, we can find the total number of items:
Total items = 10 + 40 + 20
Total items = 70

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the hours to minutes and then divide by the time it takes to deal with a call.

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes

Now, divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call:
360 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5:
24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent on land and the time spent in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

The cost of the four additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw from the 4th day to the 7th day. Since he saw an average of 60 people each day, we multiply 60 by 4 (the number of days) to get 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop, so 60 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop in the final 30 seconds.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 190

Garrett has 190 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
1 gallon = 4 cups
So, 1 gallon requires 6 lemons/cup * 4 cups = 24 lemons

Now, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for 5 gallons:
24 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 120 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
120 lemons + 12 lemons = 132 lemons

The final answer is: 132"

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs belongs to one animal, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.

The tower has 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Total number of blue and yellow blocks
= 32 - 12

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The number of pink candies is 43."

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, we can multiply 12 by 2 to find the age of the older brother. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16. 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings together: 
12 + 24 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so she spends 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week on meditation.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so she spends 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week on yoga.

In total, Charisma spends 210 + 300 = 510 minutes per week on meditation and yoga.

Since there are 4 weeks in the given period, she spends 510 * 4 = 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric needed, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and add them together.

For small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add 18 to 36, resulting in 54 seeds for the large sunflower.

Now, we add the seeds from both sunflowers: 36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
So, the discounted price of each T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. 
Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $4 = $8.

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 
40% of $40 is $16. 
So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of each ticket: $14.25 ÷ $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 x 2 = $200
Total: $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's add Ellen and Lani's totals together:
$105 + $230 = $335

They spent a total of $335."
"To find the total cost of making one jar, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients. 

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit per jar: 
Profit per jar = Selling price per jar - Total cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit = Profit per jar * 10
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for each of the two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 
Total amount spent on movie tickets = 2 * $7.50 = $15
Total amount spent = $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Janet's parents gave her $40. 
Amount left = $40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the total number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie for a snack
- 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch
- 2 sugar cookies for his friends

Total cookies eaten: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies

Now, he has:
- 9 - 3 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 3 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 4 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

Now, he has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

The total number of cookies Randy has now is: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the 6 toy soldiers that would be sold for $5 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other 6 toy soldiers that would be sold for $7 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To find the number of days it takes to fill the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)

= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
- Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, so B = 7.

Now, we know that the total number of items on the lab bench is 29. We can write an equation to represent this:
T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know, we get:
8 + 7 + 16 = 29

This equation is true, so we can conclude that Igor didn't lose any beakers.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs.
The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = (x/2) * time

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = x * 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 4 / 16
x = 1/4 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's speed = x/2 = (1/4)/2 = 1/8 miles per minute

Time = distance / speed
Time = 4 / (1/8)
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line.

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount needed: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- 6 reservations per night * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals per night
- 12 meals per night * $5 per meal = $60 per night
- $60 per night + $5 per night (wine) = $65 per night

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue would be:
$65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they are peeling oranges at the same time, we can assume that the time they spend peeling oranges is directly proportional to the number of oranges they peel.

Let's assume the number of oranges Ana peels is A and the number of oranges Jane peels is J.

Since they spend 3 minutes peeling an orange, the time Ana spends peeling A oranges is 3A minutes, and the time Jane spends peeling J oranges is 4J minutes.

We know that they spend a total of 60 minutes (1 hour) peeling oranges. So, we can set up the equation:

3A + 4J = 60

We also know that the number of oranges they peel is equal to the number of oranges they spend peeling. So, we can set up another equation:

A = J

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute A = J into the first equation:

3J + 4J = 60
7J = 60
J = 60/7
J = 8.57 (approximately)

Since A = J, A is also approximately 8.57.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

Difference = A - J
= 8.57 - 8.57
= 0

So, Ana and Jane will peel the same number of oranges after an hour.

Final answer: 0"
"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320.
The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hired a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4): 56 ÷ 4 = 14.
