"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so we need to calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh also put in $50,000 in repairs, so we need to subtract this from the new value to find the profit.

The profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens so far.

In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed to the chickens.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed to the chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed per day.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed per day - Total feed given so far
= 60 - 40
= 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 40% of the 200 GB file. 
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 
So, the first download takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and takes a 20-minute break.

After the break, Carla restarts the download from the beginning. Since she has already downloaded 80 GB, she still has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

The time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (first download) + 20 minutes (break) + 60 minutes (second download) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts.

1. The first part: John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 60 * 3
   Distance = 180 miles

2. The second part: John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.
   Distance = 0 miles

3. The third part: John drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 30 * 0.5
   Distance = 15 miles

4. The fourth part: John drives for 3.5 hours at 80 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 80 * 3.5
   Distance = 280 miles

Now, we add up the distances from each part to find the total distance John traveled.
Total Distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 280
Total Distance = 455 miles

John is 455 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (5 hours, since she worked 45 hours in total), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost of $90.

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to break even and start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + x/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms again:

x - 2x/3 - 3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 9 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 9 = 15

Add 9 to both sides:

x = 24

So Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial price: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential price at the end of the month: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial price: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential price at the end of the month: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000

Her annual salary from coaching: 
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500

Total annual salary: 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance in 1 hour. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed needed = Distance / Time
Speed needed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed needed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add up the DVDs sold: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

8"
"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need: 
60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

The distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 15 miles.

So, the distance between the first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162
Combine like terms: 18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages:
Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then add them together.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person said 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person said 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
Total points scored = 4 + 5
Total points scored = 9 points

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. We can do this by dividing the cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we can multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his 13 lego sets. 

13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He spent $20 each on 8 video games, so the total amount spent on video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

He had $5 left after buying the video games. So, the total amount he had initially is:
$195 (from selling lego sets) + $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $360

Now, we need to find out how many lego sets he has left. We know he initially had 13 lego sets and spent $195 on them. To find out how many lego sets he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount:
$360 (initial amount) - $195 (spent on lego sets) = $165

Since he spent $195 on 13 lego sets, we can divide $195 by $15 to find out how many lego sets he sold:
$195 / $15 = 13

Since he initially had 13 lego sets and sold 13, he must have sold all of them. Therefore, he has 0 lego sets left.

The final answer is 0."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings: 300g / 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48g.

The final answer is 48."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. The cost of the beeswax and the wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

Since the net profit is negative, Charlie is actually losing money."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

Total notes = 80 + 220 = 300

Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can find the number of notes in the package by subtracting the remaining notes from the total notes.

Notes in the package = Total notes - Remaining notes
= 300 - 23
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). 

200 / 40 = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, which means it's 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie. 

Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * $40 = $60

Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

Total amount spent on ties = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of units in the building. 

First, we find the total number of units: 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units.

Then, we calculate 3/4 of the total units: 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

Since the remaining units are unoccupied, we subtract the occupied units from the total units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags she can fill:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 x 20 = 120.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts together: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount she paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:
10% of 140 = 0.1 * 140 = $14
Amount paid for the second half = 140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:
Total amount paid = 840 + 756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the remaining gallons in the tank (3 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank.

25 miles per gallon × 3 gallons = 75 miles

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He also reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading."

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, she will use 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day for 185 days (365 - 180 = 185). The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much laundry David does and then compare it to Raymond's amount.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry amount.
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find Raymond's laundry amount.
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry amounts.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to calculate the cost of buying 3 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 3 * $2.50 = $7.50

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $7.50 is less than $9, buying in packages of 3 for $2.50 is the better option.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option.
Money saved = $9 - $7.50 = $1.50

"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests since 1/4 don't show up. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, she will need 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

The cost of the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we first need to calculate the amount of potato salad each adult and child will eat.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half of that, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

Since there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Since there are 5 children, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as x. 
Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Now, we solve for x: 
x = 38 - 2 
x = 36

So, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed was 36 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new speed by multiplying his original speed by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement). 

New speed = 36 * 1.1 
New speed = 39.6 

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used. 

16 / 3 = 5.33 (round down to 5 since we can't use a fraction of a tomato)

So, Freda used 5 cans of tomatoes.

Final answer: 5"
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, and there were originally 30 cars. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

Then, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 1 * 40 = 40 plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she already has: 80 - 40 = 40.

So, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

40"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day. We know he has 4 more days to complete the remaining 24 pages.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 1 * 5 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 1 glass of water on Sunday. 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekends is 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week.
Total glasses of water in a week = 5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. To do this, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 

90 / 30 = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he's left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 3 sets of 20 feet.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, we can multiply 3 sets by 2 liters per set to get 6 liters of water taken on.

The final answer is: 6"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many birds are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of each board is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $15 per board = $75.

The total revenue from selling all the boards is $150 + $75 = $225.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $225 - $180 = $45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
17.14 * 7 = 120.98 (approximately)

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to calculate 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago and subtract it from Adrien's salary.

Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
30% of Adrien's salary four years ago = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago - 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40% from four years ago, we can calculate it as follows:

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
= $40,000 + 0.4 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000

Now, we can find Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% of her salary four years ago to her salary four years ago:

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
= $28,000 + 0.4 * $28,000
= $28,000 + $11,200

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. 

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate that as follows:

60 (letters needing stamps) / 3 = 20 letters

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile:

30 (current letters) - 20 (letters put stamps on) = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12.

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can calculate:

Female Scottish unicorns = Scottish unicorns * 2/3
Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * 2/3
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, let's add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22

= 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, and there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can start by finding the number of queens. 

Let's assume the number of queens is Q. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. The sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, in 14 hours he would earn 14 * 10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items.

The total cost of the food items is:

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. 
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total food cost and the total non-food cost plus the tax:
Total cost = $5 + $10 + $1 = $16

"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. He has 3 clients now and 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72

Total income = $92

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. 

1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.

Next, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many bees had already returned by this point. We know that 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours. Since 60 bees left, we need to subtract 60 from the 15 that had already returned. 15 - 60 is -45, but since we can't have a negative number of bees, we know that 60 bees left after the 15 that had already returned. So, we need to add the 15 that had already returned to the 60 that left, which is 15 + 60 = 75 bees that left in total.

Now, we need to find out how many bees are left in the hive. We know that 30 bees left initially, and 75 bees left after the 15 that had already returned. So, 30 + 75 = 105 bees left in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many bees are left in the hive. We know that 105 bees left, and 15 bees returned. So, 105 - 15 = 90 bees are left in the hive.

Now, we know that 90 bees are left in the hive, and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours. We need to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours. Since 60 bees left, we need to subtract 60 from the 90 bees left. 90 - 60 = 30 bees return in the last 6 hours.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change. 

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

We know that there were 5 fries left after the ants took one. So, before the ants took one, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon took some 'x'. Then, the raccoon took 2/3 * x fries. So, the remaining fries are 1/3 * x. We know that 1/3 * x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 18.

Now, before the raccoon took some fries, there were 18 + 2 = 20 fries.

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So, before the pigeons ate, there were 20 + 9 = 29 fries.

The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, before the seagull ate, there were 29 + 7 = 36 fries.

Dave ate 14 fries initially, so the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is 36 + 14 = 50.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.
Converting the total length of the croissants to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round
180 yards * 34 rounds = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since Sally Four is 8 years old, and Sally Two is 19 years old, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the total age of the two older birds. However, we don't have the total age of the two older birds. 

We can find the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red: 19 + 16 = 35 years.

Now, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red from the total age of all four birds. However, we still don't have the total age of all four birds.

We can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the age of Granny Red: 16 - 8 = 8 years.

Now we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and the fourth bird (8).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51 years.

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays each month, we need to add the minimum payments for all her debts and then multiply by 1.5 (since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum).

Minimum payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we multiply the total by 1.5:
$1000 * 1.5 = $1500

To find the yearly amount, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes)

Now, we multiply the time to prepare one potato by the total number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

5699.94"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate their total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members. 

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total number of Chinese team members - Number of boys on the Chinese team
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of rolling 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 or 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities together to get (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we divide 1/4 by 1 and multiply by 100: (1/4) / 1 * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide her mom's apples by 2, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Total apples = Mom's apples + Jenna's apples
Total apples = 20 + 10
Total apples = 30

The answer is 30."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages, we divide the total number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

Total amount of insects per week = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the number of trees he planted and the number of trees he chopped down over the 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so over 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so over 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees died. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees died.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the initial number of trees: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

So, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the award amount of $5000 to his total earnings:

$104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

Since he received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the 5% raise on his new total earnings. To calculate the raise, we need to calculate 5% of $105,000:

5% of $105,000 = 0.05 * $105,000 = $5,250

Now, let's add the raise to his total earnings:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups.
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she can earn $60 in 12 babysitting sessions, she can afford the jacket and shoes in 12 sessions. However, she needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the same amount."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides, we get 8r = 32.

Divide both sides by 8, we get r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find out how many customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x gallons of water now.

Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it now has 2x - 16 gallons. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

2x - 4x = 16
-2x = 16
x = -8 (this can't be true, so we'll try another approach)

Let's try another method. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the small pool lost 16 gallons, it now has:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total amount she needs is the cost of the shoes and the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she will be paying $165 a month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses in the vase. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias in the vase.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on Harriet's age.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the four students: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately.

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. 
A third of that amount is 15000 / 3 = 5000. 
So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years: 
15000 + 5000 = 20000.

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100. 
Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"To find out how much Chad owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal.

The base burrito is $6.50.
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00, so the total cost of the extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00.
He also adds 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so the total cost of the sauces is $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.
The total cost of the meal so far is $6.50 + $4.00 + $0.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so he subtracts that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Chad owes $9.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial 36 watermelons from the total.

120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons.

3/4 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total.

84 - 63 = 21

The answer is 21."

"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave.

So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the snow.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced per vine.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so he writes 60 pages per week in 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave him some fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is 14."

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can find the total number of students in the school:
Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class
= 30 students

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is:
15 + 12 = 27 girls

Now, we can find the number of girls in the third class:
Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - Total number of girls in the first two classes
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls, so the third class must have 3 girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 66 / 12 = 5.5 cups.

The final answer is 5.5."
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

9,300 * 2/3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, then add the marbles she received from her friend.

5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find the total amount of money the girls have, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find out how much more it is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000
Net proceeds: $400,000 - $368,000 = $32,000

The final answer is: $32,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Now, let's add up the time: 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

There are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in all three bags: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

To find the total number of windows in the additional windows not connected to bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the prices of the items together.

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35

The total cost of the items is $20.00. The mother pays $20.00, so the change she receives is $0.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches left for the two sleeves.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2.
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from both scenes and the song: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is 2/5 * 80 = 32.
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48.
3. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is 1/2 * 48 = 24.
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24.
5. 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is 5/8 * 24 = 15.
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9.
7. The number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, let's denote their current ages as Mico's age = x and Marco's age = 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10) = 30 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 15 + 30 = 45 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in each necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week: 20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 120 = 280 stories.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8. 

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 39 = (1/10)x

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 10: 
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. 

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates he sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates he sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The initial bid was $200. Since the bids rose by $50 each time, the next three bids would be $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of the initial bid and the three bids: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

"To calculate the total miles driven per year, we need to calculate the miles driven per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a year.

Miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles (to and from work) = 60 miles
Miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is:
Total bonus = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus:
Total cost = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes
Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2:
2 * 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells at 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses per week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

4 weeks"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person eats in a week and then add them up.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Cera was half as old as Noah, we can set up an equation: 
   Let's say Noah's age six years ago was x. 
   Since Cera was half as old as Noah six years ago, Cera's age six years ago was x/2. 
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, we can set up the equation: 
   x/2 + 6 = 46
   Solving for x, we get x = 40. 
   So, Noah's current age is 40 + 6 = 46.

2. Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. 
   The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. 
   Since Noah is 46 years old now, six years ago, he was 40 years old. 
   So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 40 = 120,000.

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the equation: 
   120,000 = 0.5 * current population
   Solving for the current population, we get: 
   current population = 120,000 / 0.5 = 240,000.

The final answer is: 240,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, so we need to find 1/4 of 8. 1/4 of 8 is 2. We subtract 2 from the number of people who could come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 
Now, the total number of marbles is 20 + 8 = 28.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is required. 

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can divide 45 by 3 to find the number of electric poles. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the beginning, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 

1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men. 

Number of men who left = 1/4 of 40 = 10

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 10 = 15

Since 10 men left, the number of women who left is also 10. 

Number of women who stayed = 15 - 10 = 5

Therefore, 5 women are left at the party.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. We know that she also has 2 loose pencils. Let's represent the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3
x = -7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense in this context)

However, let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. We can set up the equation:
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we know the number of pencils in each box. To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the number of boxes Jam has to the number of boxes Meg has. We don't know how many pencils Meg has in her boxes, but we know she has 46 pencils in total. 

Let's represent the number of pencils in each of Meg's boxes as 'y'. 
The total number of pencils Meg has is 3y + 2 (since she has 2 loose pencils). 

We know that 3y + 2 = 46
3y = 44
y = 44/3
y = 14.67 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense in this context)

However, let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Meg has 46 pencils in total, and 2 of them are loose. So, the number of pencils in her boxes is 46 - 2 = 44. 

Now, we know the number of pencils in each of Meg's boxes. To find the total number of boxes, we can divide the number of pencils in her boxes by the number of pencils in each box:
44/8 = 5.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we can round down to 5 boxes for Meg.

Now, we know the number of pencils in each box (8) and the number of boxes Jam has (3) and the number of boxes Meg has (5). To find the total number of boxes, we can add the number of boxes Jam has to the number of boxes Meg has:
3 + 5 = 8

The total number of boxes is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube), the coffee is cooled by 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

Since the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube, the total weakening caused by the cooling is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Next, let's calculate the weakening caused by the added cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.

Now, we add the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each trade involves 2 old records, we can divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

7 new records / 2 old records per new record = 3.5 old records

Since you can't trade half a record, we can round down to 3 old records per person. 

Now, we multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

3 old records per person * 5 people = 15 old records

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 
20 (total people heading to the third stop) - 7 (people who got off at the second stop) = 13.

Since we already know that 13 people got on the bus at the terminal, we can confirm that the answer is indeed 13.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they got were 4 * 2 = 8 dollars off.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100
Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: $6240"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Wednesday: 0.5 hours
Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses first. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

Now, we add the pots for the daisies and roses: 30 + 60 = 90 pots.

Since April already had 100 pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.
Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on other activities.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time he spent on vacation:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:

40% of 50 hours = 0.4 * 50
time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract it from the cost of the phone.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, so we need to subtract this from her total earnings:
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs to save $195 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.

She also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget.

$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming she doesn't charge her friends for the activities), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend.

$60 ÷ $0 = $60

Since we can't divide by zero, we can say that Morgan can invite 60 friends, but in reality, she can invite 59 friends, as she will have $0 left for any additional expenses."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total amount he spent on gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he spent half of his change, the total change he had initially is 2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we know that Billy had $10 initially and spent $4 on gumballs, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find the number of pounds of candy he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound: 6 / 1.5 = 4.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To find the son's age, let's denote the son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, let's solve for 'x':

2x - 5 = 45
2x = 50
x = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 675.

18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua.

The average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing."
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip to his friend's house, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

To find the time taken for the trip back home, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip: 2.86 + 3 = 5.86 hours

The trip took 5.86 hours."
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

87"
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.
Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. Minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out is 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + 8 (since Sara scored 8 points)

3x = 22

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 22 / 3
x = 7.33

So, Sara had approximately 7.33 points before. 

Since Erin had 3 times more points than Sara, Erin had 3 * 7.33 = 22.99 points before.

The final answer is 22.99."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

1. Picture frames: 
   44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   20% of $20 is $4, so the total cost for etching the logo is 44 * $4 = $176
   Total cost for picture frames = $880 + $176 = $1056

2. Pins: 
   2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers:
   1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors
   11 seniors * $12 per cord = $132

Total cost for cords = $132

Total cost for senior gifts = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan made his own, he saves 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the materials is $400 - $80 = $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper, which is $320 + $400 = $720."

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, 40% of x is the number of faulty pieces. 

0.4x = number of faulty pieces

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, and this is the cost of all the pieces, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = x * cost per piece

We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / x

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for the number of faulty pieces:

0.4x = x * (400,000 / x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.4x = 400,000

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get:

x = 1,000,000

So, the total number of pieces is 1,000,000.

Now, we can find the number of faulty pieces:

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4x
= 0.4 * 1,000,000
= 400,000

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 1,000,000 - 400,000
= 600,000

The cost of functioning pieces is the total amount spent minus the cost of faulty pieces. We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / 1,000,000
= 0.4

Now, we can find the cost of functioning pieces:

Cost of functioning pieces = number of functioning pieces * cost per piece
= 600,000 * 0.4
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the total amount of milk from both halves.

Since she has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, Mary collects 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children.

A dozen is equal to 12. So, Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find out how many pupils like yellow, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

Now, we have 40 - 20 = 20 pupils left. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest. The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months.
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1,105."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Half of the people can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 52 / 2 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people who can make it. 

The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he saves 20% when they are bundled. 

20% of $10 is $2, so the cost of the bundle is $10 - $2 = $8 per month. 

Since he chooses both Hulu and Disney Plus, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 + $8 = $18 per month.

Now, let's calculate the monthly savings by cancelling the cable package. The cost of the cable package is $60 per month. The cost of the streaming services is $18 per month. 

The monthly savings is $60 - $18 = $42.

Total work time: 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

The final answer is: 21.43"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more, we get 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards received: 17
Cards given away: 29

Total cards Erica has now: 50 + 17 - 29 = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a decimal or find the whole number of slices. 

7/12 is approximately 0.583, which is roughly 0.583 * 12 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from the initial 7 slices:
7 - 2 = 5

There are 5 slices left.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

Mark earns $10 per day, so we can divide the bike cost by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to work to save for the bike.

$300 (bike cost) ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

However, Mark is short $250, so he would need to work for 30 days and then have some money left over. 

To find out how much money Mark will have after 30 days, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days:

$10 (daily earnings) x 30 (days) = $300

Since Mark already has $50, he will have a total of $50 + $300 = $350 after 30 days. This means he will have enough money to buy the bike after 30 days of work.

Mark needs to work for 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30

Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, let's add up the total number of bugs: 
90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total ounces = 2 * 8 = 16
Total calories = 16 * 3 = 48

John consumed 48 calories."
"To find the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks worked per month, and then multiply that by 12 months.

4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Since the builder gets paid $50 per day, we multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage:

288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of milk per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk per batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts per day.

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts.

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the total energy from watts to kilowatts:
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts per day.

The new total energy usage in 30 days:
2700 watts/day * 30 days = 81,000 watts.

Now, we calculate the energy saved:
216,000 watts - 81,000 watts = 135,000 watts.

Converting the energy saved from watts to kilowatts:
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.

The final answer is: 135."
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total amount of money spent on the meat and cheese, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns initially. He bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns. So, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis and 0 + 40 = 40 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 40 = 140."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
Total amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees. 
Total amount paid in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

Sally has $3 left."
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12). 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. To find the answer, we would need more information about the relationship between the two defects.

However, assuming that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as follows:

5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 x 50000 = 2500 candles

So, 2500 candles smell like wet dog. 

Since we assumed that these are the ones that also explode, the final answer is 2500."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
30% of $20 is 0.3 x $20 = $6.

The discounted price for each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since they have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation based on the number of bumps:

2C + D = 304 (since each camel contributes 2 bumps and each dromedary contributes 1 bump)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and each animal has one head. So, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations:

2C + D = 304
C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is 30 * 3/5 = 18.
4. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total amount Cole saved. Since he saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. 

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). 

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
8 - 2 = 6

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since there were only 18 prepared for two hotdogs, we need to find out how many extra hotdogs were needed. 

To do this, we subtract the number of prepared hotdogs from the total number of guests: 40 - 18 = 22. 

Since each guest needs one more hotdog, we can conclude that 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount:
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 gallons.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the total amount of money he had initially. 1% of $5 is 0.01 * 5 = 0.05 dollars. So, he had 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 dollars initially.

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars. We subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount: 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 dollars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can plug these values into the formula:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the final temperature, let's break down the process step by step:

1. Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the temperature increases by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.
3. The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.
4. Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. Since the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, it cools down 3 times (30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3). So, the temperature decreases by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.
5. The final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We also know that James won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 50 - 10 = 40 minutes.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can multiply the distance by the cost of hay per mile:

Total cost of hay = Distance * Cost per mile
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $3/mile
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of hay from the total money:
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $1 (the extra cost of the super ticket) + $3 (the cost of the soda) = $4.

So, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $20 + $2 = $22.

Now, we know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $4. We can set up an equation to find the price of the popcorn:

$12 + P + $3 = $22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$12 + P + $3 = $22
$15 + P = $22
P = $22 - $15
P = $7

The regular price of the popcorn is $7."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. 
So, the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase. 
The cost of filling 170 balloons is $65 * 170 = $11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

The volume of one bed is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and height: 
2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume by 2:
320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags

Finally, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost:
160 bags * $12 per bag = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil will be $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We also know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the total number of fairies remaining, let's break down the events:

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
Then, half of those fairies (50 / 2 = 25) flew in from the east, so now there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
After 10 minutes, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips.

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month will be 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Since she keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students, she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given away by 10 to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. 9 - 8 = 1.

The difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky is 1 dollar."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room: 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items per room by 80: 15 * 80 = 1200

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

He starts with 200 shoes.
On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 200 + 5 = 205 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, so he now has 205 + 15 = 220 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, so he now has 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.
On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so he now has 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

The final answer is 70."
"To find out how many cupcakes Mary needs to bake, we need to multiply the number of jars of sprinkles by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   1/5 of 30 pencils = (1/5) * 30 = 6 pencils.

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   30 - 6 = 24 pencils.

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   1/3 of 24 pencils = (1/3) * 24 = 8 pencils.

So, there are 8 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many books Sarah gave to each child, we need to first find out how many books she bought in total. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books.

300 ÷ 15 = 20

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both, since they were counted twice: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is: 607"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.
Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the money Keegan and Tashay have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is $200, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract $174 from $200: $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply Gabriel's songs by 3. 
Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Since Gabriel can add up to 100 songs, and Luri already has 60 songs, the number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 60 = 40.

The difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can consider the cost of 2 packs as the cost of 4 razors. So, the effective cost of 8 razors is $8.00.

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost: $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are 8 razors, we divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor: $6.00 / 8 = $0.75.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.75 * 100 = 75 cents.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 x 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 x 64"" = 192"" (since the 60"" girl is not part of this layer) and then add the 60"" of the 10th girl, so 192"" + 60"" = 252"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 x 64"" = 128"".

Now, let's add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 252"" + 128"" = 636"".

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, which is $5x. 
The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, which is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. 
So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the total number of animals in both places: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To find the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, the number of days from December 31st to July 19th is 183 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories in 183 days. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 183 days ≈ 19.2 calories per day.

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 19.2 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. In a week, he would earn 30 * 7 = $210.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

90,000"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, we add the individual amounts:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is 29."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 more passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer from the total to find the cost of the two monitors. 
$2,400 - $1,100 = $1,300

Since there are two monitors, we divide the cost of the two monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. 
$1,300 / 2 = $650

The cost of one monitor is $650."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 20 kids in total, the boys brought 20 * 60 = 1200 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 1200 + 4 * 60 = 1200 + 240 = 1440 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, we can divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

1440 / 10 = 144.

The final answer is 144."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that George has 3 candies left after eating 5. 

Since George had twice as many candies as Nick, we can represent the number of candies Nick had as 'x'. This means George had 2x candies. 

We know that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 left, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 3 + 5, which simplifies to 2x = 8.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 8 / 2, which simplifies to x = 4.

So, Nick had 4 candies initially. 

The final answer is: 4"

31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the total vlogs she aims to make per month.

Vlogs left to make = 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families notified in each round and then add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:

So, his weekly earnings are 2 * 5 * 4 = $40.

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide $80 by $40:
$80 / $40 = 2 weeks.

The answer is 2."
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost = $40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons. Since these buttons have four holes each, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. 

Octavia drinks 1/2 of the daily recommended cups, which is 1/2 * 4 = 2 cups. 
Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. 
To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he drinks: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

The answer is 16."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

The total number of rodents is 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the new angle.

The sun moves 5 degrees an hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 32 - 50
New angle = -18 degrees

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle.

New angle = -18 + 360
New angle = 342 degrees

However, the angle cannot be greater than 180 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the new angle from 180 to get the correct angle.

New angle = 180 - 342
New angle = -162 degrees

Again, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle.

New angle = -162 + 360
New angle = 198 degrees

The final angle of the sun relative to the ground is 198 degrees."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs. Since the younger son is 8 years old, he will need 8 candles. The older son is 12 years old, so he will need 12 candles. 

In total, James needs 8 + 12 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many packs James needs. 20 / 5 = 4.

So, James needs 4 packs of candles. 4 packs will cost 4 x $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read in total. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first and second week: 
70 + 100 = 170 pages

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals: 80 - 20 = 60. 

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals: 80 - 45 = 35.

So, the number of goals scored by each teenager is as follows:
- Richie: 80
- Mark: 60
- Anna: 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4 = $84

Since Liam made $63, we need to subtract this from the amount Mitchell made to find the difference.

Difference = $84 - $63 = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend. 

21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of $5 * 3 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He had $70 initially, so after spending $15, he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $55 left, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 3 + 27 = 30."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The net profit of the food truck is $37.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. 

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.
The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.
The cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5: (20 + (20/2)) / 5
   First, calculate half of 20: 20/2 = 10
   Then, add 10 to 20: 20 + 10 = 30
   Finally, divide 30 by 5: 30 / 5 = 6
3. The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12)
   First, subtract 12 from 20: 20 - 12 = 8
   Then, multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to add 4% to the set temperature to get the correct temperature. 

First, we need to convert 4% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 
4 / 100 = 0.04

Now, we add 0.04 to the set temperature: 
450 + 0.04 = 450.04

So, Maggie should set her oven to 450.04 degrees."

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since there are 90 single-use contacts in 1 box, 2 boxes will have:
90 * 2 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. 
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. 
So, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"

He increases his speed by 5 words, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM.
Then, he increases his speed by 5 words again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57 WPM. 
To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it's taller than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we can multiply the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms by the amount of mushrooms John eats per day (200 grams) to get the amount of protein he gets per day: 
0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the amount of protein John gets per day by 7 to get the amount of protein he gets per week: 
6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"

Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

He has $12 left."
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven in a month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

Cost per pump = $0.20 per washing / 60 washings = $0.00333 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: 
$0.00333 * 100 = 0.33 cents per pump.

The final answer is 0.33."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20
Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he won't have any money left after the purchase.

Final answer: $0"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 by 12:

28 * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the length of his street by the cost per meter. 

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194 per meter
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $95,660

To find the difference in cost, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,660 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $66,560

The final answer is: $66,560"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,377,625

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,377,625 = $2,877,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,877,625."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

The group will have 93 posts in March."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

The final answer is: $312"

Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = Total seats - seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb/hour

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's calculate the difference: 48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The cost of the cars for James is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000. 

The profit is the total sales minus the cost, which is $100,000 - $75,000 = $25,000. 

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $25,000 = $2,500.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate 25% of 100.

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Now, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate 60% of 25.

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright on the wave.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

Number of men = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women
= 25 - 15
= 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. 

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed.

The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. 

time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $10
Total cost of classes = $100

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $100, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $100.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. The total cost will be:
$60 (initial cost) + $10(x-1) (cost of the remaining classes)

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to $100.

$60 + $10(x-1) ≤ $100
$10(x-1) ≤ $40
x - 1 ≤ 4
x ≤ 5

Since Manny can't miss a fraction of a class, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 4.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary is his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

The final answer is: $372000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 pants * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley biked 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

Total likes = 20128.57

The final answer is 20129."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, let's calculate the cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

Since the final price paid by Clara is less than the final price paid by Sheila, the difference is negative."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of the green hats. Let's call the sales of the green hats 'x'. Since the sales of the red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales of the red hats are x/2.

The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales of the red hats and the green hats: x/2 + x = 3x/2.

Since the sales of the red hats were $400, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 800.

Now that we know the sales of the green hats, we can find the total sales for the first month: 3x/2 = 3(800)/2 = 1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = 900.

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales of the first and second months: 1200 + 900 = 2100.

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours first. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's wage was overpaid by $120."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find out how many whole eggs are needed.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 whole eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days left = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 x $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 x $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 x $10,000 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 * $6 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of other items) = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they share equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

So, each person would have $120.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are two sets of siblings: one twin and one triplet.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

Let's denote the age of the triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 37

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18.5

Since x represents the age of the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in 10 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 * 10 = 120 months in 10 years. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 10 years, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In 10 years, Neil saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have, we need to add the coins saved by Rong and Neil. 

Total coins = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. 
0.6x = 60

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.6.
x = 60 / 0.6
x = 100

The total bill is $100. The cost of the vaccines is $40. 
$100 - $40 = $60

John brought $125. He leaves with $125 - $60 = $65."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

Red squares: 14
Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Total number of squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs: 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs needed: 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs.

Since there are already 8 high chairs, we subtract 8 from the total number of chairs needed to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get: 48 - 8 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we find the number of bucks: 50 * 0.5 = 25 bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find out how many points the class has, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of children of each generation.

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
Each of her children has 3 children, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Since we are asked to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city display and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 more friends they meet at the cinema. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends
Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.

Total number of drinks = 2 * Total number of people
Total number of drinks = 2 * 20
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = 3 * Total number of people
Total number of snacks = 3 * 20
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks.

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * $2
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * $2
Total cost of snacks = 60 * $2
Total cost of snacks = $120

Total cost of drinks and snacks = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $80 + $120
Total cost of drinks and snacks = $200

The group spent $200 on snacks and drinks."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry and then determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount of gravel Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total.

4,000 (Gissela's truck) + 4,800 (Gordy's truck) = 8,800 pounds

Now, subtract 8,800 from 11,600 to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry.

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much he initially received. 

Since the total ratio parts is 3 + 2 = 5, and Gerald received 3 parts, we can calculate his share as follows:

Gerald's share = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:

Gerald's remaining money = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes, that means 20% of 40% is used for non-industrial purposes. 

20% of 40% = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08 or 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be 14 * 12 = $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of the croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of the cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of the mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final bill is $45.00."
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops for free. 

So, she can buy 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free, which is a total of 4 scoops.

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the number of minutes.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her feet at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. She dances for 5 minutes with her arms down, so the total number of taps is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When her arms are up, Helga taps her feet at a rate of 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. She dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, so the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually loses $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Total chairs initially = 170 (normal) + 23 (baby) = 193

Chairs sent for repair = 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Chairs left = Total chairs initially - Chairs sent for repair
= 193 - 33

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.33 x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 people, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all 5 people: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches: 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe in inches: 
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10 

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

The answer is 40%."
"To find the number of people who had voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by midday and then add the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.

By midday, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

The remaining people who had not voted by midday are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted between midday and 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, multiply the number of kids by 2: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, multiply the number of adults by 1: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.

Now, add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years old.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

Now, let's add their ages together: 
Dora's age + her father's age + her mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 10, so candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100, and candidate A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 

The number of votes candidate C got is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount. 
90 - 87 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we add 6 to Steven's total. 

10 + 6 = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. 

Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. 

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98"
"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15. 

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - (10 + 15) = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost of the first amusement park, we need to multiply the number of adults by the adult fee and the number of children by the child fee, then add the two amounts together.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 5 students per group.

Now, we need to find the total number of groups needed. 
54 students / 5 students per group = 10.8 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 11 groups.

To find the number of groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed from the total number of groups required. 
12 groups (already formed) - 10 groups (required) = 2 groups.

Therefore, 2 more groups are needed to form."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 days.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 60 * 20 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 days.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 100 * 8 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 (weekdays) + 800 (weekends) = 2000.

The final answer is: 2000"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation 'x'. 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find out how many people are remaining after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - people who think horse #2 will win - people who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies:
Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the movies in series:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * $6
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Now, let's calculate the cost of the older movies:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, let's calculate the cost of the normal movies:
Cost of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we need to find half of their driving speed. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply their hiking speed by the time they hiked:

Let's assume Emma's score is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy points will be x + 8 * 10 = x + 80.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma's berry points will be (x + 3) * 5 = 5x + 15.

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so her time bonus will be 30 * 4 = 120.

Emma's total score will be x + 5x + 15 = 6x + 15.

Ava's total score will be x + 80 + 5x + 15 + 120 = 6x + 215.

The difference between their scores is 6x + 215 - (6x + 15) = 200.

The final answer is 200."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's assume that x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W. Since he had 4 white fish initially, the number of white fish he has now is W = 4 + (17 - x).

We know that the number of orange fish he has now is 3 - x. Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2W
3 - x = 2(4 + 17 - x)
3 - x = 2(21 - x)
3 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 39

So, 39 orange fish were taken out. Now, we can find the number of white fish taken out:

17 - x = 17 - 39
17 - x = -22

Since we can't have a negative number of fish, this means that the initial number of white fish must have been 22. 

Now, we can find the number of white fish Bob bought at the store:

W = 4 + (17 - x)
W = 4 + (17 - 39)
W = 4 - 22
W = -18

Since we can't have a negative number of fish, this means that the initial number of white fish must have been 22. 

Now, we can find the number of white fish Bob bought at the store:

Number of white fish bought = 22 - 4
Number of white fish bought = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. So, the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy travels 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how much gas he consumes in a week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can divide the total distance by his fuel efficiency:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we can multiply the amount of gas consumed by the price per gallon:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent on lunch is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The total number of seashells brought back is 12."

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month.
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Then, multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
300 bottle caps * $0.25 = $75

Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours (11 - 8 = 3), her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in the first month: 200 employees * $4000 = $800,000
Total amount paid in the second month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in the third month: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats.
0.3 * (x + 14) = x

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying 0.3 by (x + 14):

0.3x + 4.2 = x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides of the equation:

4.2 = 0.7x

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them. 

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 40 * 2 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per square inch and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed.

Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower: 
- 3 - 1 = 2
- 4 - 1 = 3

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Marshmallows dropped = 3

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Total S'mores they can make = 17
Number of kids = 2

S'mores per kid = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

John can have 8 S'mores.
DeSean can have 8 S'mores.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts. 

First, we need to find out how long each person played. Since they played for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:
- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time they played: 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other two friends played for 40 minutes in total. We need to find out how many quarters they used. 
40 minutes is equal to 40 / 20 = 2 quarters.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, he used 1 quarter. The other two friends used 2 quarters in total. So, the total amount of money used is 1 + 2 = 3 quarters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40. 
20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game, we need to first find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. 

Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, and Sasha scored 14 points, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add up the points Sasha scored in both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find the difference, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins:
88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Then, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan started with $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, it means she actually spent more than she had."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them up.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on each activity: 72 videos (recording) + 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

The final answer is: 86"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total time by the number of turtles.

Time for four turtles = Total time / Number of turtles
Time for four turtles = 18 hours / 4
Time for four turtles = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find out how many clay dishes they all make together, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes they made together: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that the total amount she has is $400 (new laptop price) + x (her savings) + $150 (job pay) + $80 (mom's help) = $50 (remaining amount needed).

The equation is: 400 + x + 150 + 80 = 50

Combine the constants: 630 + x = 50

Subtract 630 from both sides: x = -580

However, this doesn't make sense because Erika can't have a negative amount of money. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct equation should be: 400 + x + 150 + 80 = 650 (the total amount she has, not the remaining amount needed)

The correct equation is: 630 + x = 650

Subtract 630 from both sides: x = 20

So, Erika has $20 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces per day (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows needed.

5 cows - 3 cows = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used. 
The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

To find the total number of dishes, we know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find out how many dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. 

Let's say Fawn has x books. 
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. 
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation: 
x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms: 
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs. We can do this by dividing the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, that means Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
Tobias ate 2/5 of 60 pieces, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, the remaining pieces are:
36 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

Her hourly rate is $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find Melanie's present age, we need to subtract 10 years from her age in 10 years. 

Melanie's age in 10 years = 18
Melanie's present age = 18 - 10 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's say her age in x years will be 3 times her present age. 
So, 8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the number of microphones that can't be arranged. 

20% of 50 microphones can't be arranged, so we calculate 20% of 50:
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Since 10 microphones can't be arranged, we subtract them from the total number of microphones:
50 - 10 = 40

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Whatchamacallit speed = 11 * Thingamabob speed

We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

121 = 11 * Thingamabob speed

To find the thingamabob speed, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Thingamabob speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob speed, we can find the whirligig speed by multiplying it by 5:

Whirligig speed = 5 * Thingamabob speed
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We can subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

$11 (total) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. 

The cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 13 * 6 = 78
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * 13 * 6 = 234
- Alba's lawn: 5 * 13 * 6 = 390

Total amount from mowing lawns: 78 + 234 + 390 = 702

Now, let's subtract the total amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $702 = -$622

However, this is not possible since she made a positive amount. This means our initial assumption that she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, and Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, we can set up the equation:

3x = 5x - x
3x = 4x
x = 0

This means she didn't mow Joe's lawn at all. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 0 times. And since she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 0 times.

The only remaining option is that she mowed Joe's lawn once, and the rest of the money came from lemonade sales.

Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she earned 6 dollars from mowing lawns. The remaining amount is $80 - $6 = $74.

The final answer is 74."
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 
3x = 7, where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't have a fraction of a notebook)

So Joseph initially had 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's:
12 - 2 = 10

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 + 1/5. 

1 + 1/5 = 6/5

Anis's distance = 6/5 * 50 miles
Anis's distance = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance by adding Dijana's and Anis's distances.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles
Total distance = 110 miles

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's compare their total pages:
Denise's total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages
Daniel's total: 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x2 = 8 bowls in total. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. Since everyone eats one bowl at a meal, 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls are left for the children. 8 total bowls - 4 bowls eaten = 4 bowls left.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 4 bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, 3 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6.75 yards (for large masks) = 16.75 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write an equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write another equation:

D = 60

Now we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A - 8 + 8
60 = 2A

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:

60/2 = 2A/2
30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we need to add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find the number of yellow balloons, we divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 / 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl had initially.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to subtract the number of fruits eaten by Lola from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

Total fruits bought: 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 fruits
Fruits eaten by Lola: 2

Fruits left: 14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total cost of lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost of lollipops = 300 * $0.5
Total cost of lollipops = $150

Total profit = Total number of lollipops sold * Selling price per lollipop - Total cost of lollipops
Total profit = 300 * $0.8 - $150
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we divide 27 by 3 to get 9 cups per row. 

Now, we know that she brews equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, and she brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups for mint tea in each row must be 9 - 1 = 8 cups."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips, which equals 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 
Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to multiply the rate by the number of days to find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days.
500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

So, after 6 days, there will be 3000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

3000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$124 / $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156
Total Junebugs removed on Thursday and Friday = 48 + 57 = 105
Total Junebugs removed in 5 days = 39 + 156 + 105 = 300

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

First, let's add up the number of toys Sophie already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys already had: 48
Bouncy balls in the tube: 62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

Now, we can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total, including Maria, the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial 10 balloons to the 15 additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

25"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

They need 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would pay, we first need to calculate the number of hours he stays at the hotel. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. So, he stays for 18 hours.

Since he chooses the 12-hour option for the first 12 hours, he pays 1000 pesos. 

For the remaining 6 hours, he adds 70 pesos for each hour. So, he pays 6 * 70 = 420 pesos.

The total amount Cameron pays is 1000 + 420 = 1420 pesos.

If he had chosen the 24-hour option, he would have paid 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron saves is 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount: 250 - 50 = 200 dollars.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40

Cost of parts = $60

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 is -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She started with 15 stickers.
2. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up the equation: 
Marcus's age = 0.5 * Leo's age
21 = 0.5 * Leo's age
Leo's age = 21 / 0.5
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. 
Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points. 
Bahati scored (x + 10) + 20 points, which is x + 30.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms: 
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 5/3

Since x represents Dinar's points, Dinar scored 5/3 points. However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can assume that the question is asking for whole numbers. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Dinar scored 5 points, then Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep from 2:15 to 2:38 am. 
2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, we need to add those 5 minutes to the total time. 
23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes

However, we also need to consider the time she usually sleeps. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We need to convert 8 hours into minutes. 
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we can subtract the time she was awake from her usual sleep time to find out how many minutes she slept that day. 
480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 100 + 700 = 800.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 1000
Total occupied beds = 800
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to her family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the remainder is 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3. 
Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is approximately 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jeffrey carried half of Jason's amount. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the supplies cost and add it to the supplies cost.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
2. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We also know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so:
X + S + A = 339

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
5A - 8 = 339

Add 8 to both sides:
5A = 347

Divide both sides by 5:
A = 69.4

Since the number of Pokémon caught must be a whole number, we'll round down to 69 (as you can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now, substitute A = 69 into the second equation:
S = 4(69) - 13
S = 276 - 13
S = 263

So, Stan has caught 263 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 263"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling south for the first and third legs, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the northern and southern homes:
300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at the office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies made and received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6).

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each phone.

The first phone costs $600.
The second phone also costs $600.
The third phone costs half of $600, which is $300.
The fourth phone also costs half of $600, which is $300.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total number of players.

Total number of players = 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the initial amount:
240 - 4 = 236 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find 1/4 of 236:
236 * 1/4 = 59 oranges

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept from the total:
236 - 59 = 177 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 177 oranges.

177"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, let's add the number of states in both countries:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much Tyler needs to earn, we need to add up the cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 
$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total.

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's total from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (20 + 30)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $480

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to convert this to inches as well: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space each plant will occupy: 12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between) = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant occupies: 1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4.

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 flowers * $6/flower = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, we multiply the daily pretzel consumption by 7 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

9 pretzels * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

The total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. So, the room was cooled by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. So, the room was cooled by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour, so it warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total change in temperature. The room was initially cooled by 6 degrees, then cooled by 12 degrees, and finally warmed up by 4 degrees. So, the net change in temperature is 6 - 12 - 4 = -10 degrees.

The final answer is -10."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 3 * 30

Simplifying the equation:
x + 30 = 90

Subtracting 30 from both sides:
x = 60

So, Bill was 60 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Let's subtract the $200 from Walter's total: $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Now, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the remaining amount ($1800) by 3.

$1800 * 3 = $5400.

However, this is the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200. To find the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to add the $200 to the $5400.

$5400 + $200 = $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1/2 * 1500 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices and then the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, let's say each kid gets a slice of size y. Then, each adult gets a slice of size 2y.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2y + 4y = 6

Combine like terms: 6y = 6

Divide both sides by 6: y = 1

So each kid gets a slice of size 1, and each adult gets a slice of size 2.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total number of slices they get. Since each adult gets 2 slices, and there are 6 slices in total, each adult gets 2/6 = 1/3 of the watermelon.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

So each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the monthly cost, which is $480 - $480 = $0.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract Martha's number of chocolate bars per box from Peter's number of chocolate bars per box: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61916 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61916 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6191.60

The final answer is: $6191.60"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, let's add up the total number of sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the number of hours they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.

One-fourth of these students are male, so the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, let's find the number of students under 16 years old: 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students.

One-half of these students are male, so the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we can find the number of female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we need to add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old.

Since one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, three-fourths are female. So, the number of female students over 16 years old is 1500 * 3/4 = 1125.

Now, we can find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons were pumped.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons were pumped.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The final answer is 94."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, we get $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10 and spent $10.25, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this is not possible since he can't spend more than he has. This means he can't buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces given away (780) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many pieces each friend received.

780 / 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album.

Since 3 albums were selfies, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, so the number of portraits is 8 - 3 = 5.

Therefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 5 portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to first determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

James reads 18 pages, and since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

18 / 3 = 6

Since it takes him 10 minutes to read each set of 3 pages, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes.

6 * 10 = 60

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

The number of guests remaining is now 61 + 30 = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many easy questions Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate 75% of 40% of the total questions.

40% of 60 questions = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions
75% of 24 easy questions = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

Since the rest of the questions (60 - 24 = 36) are divided equally between average and difficult questions, each type has 18 questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 / 2 = 9 questions.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 (easy questions) + 9 (average and difficult questions) = 27 questions.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total amount earned from large stuffed animals. Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is y. Then, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12y.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y.

The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2y * 4 = 8y.

We know that the total amount earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine like terms:

20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

y = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

Number of small stuffed animals = 2y = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply 11 sandwiches per day by 7 days in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found, so the number of eggs that were found is 100 - 10 = 90.

Now, we subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs found: 90 - 60 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we multiply the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe by 40 dwarves and 30 days: 
40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

The final answer is 43,200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 
150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move between bottles:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 11 * 2 = $22.
Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 6 * 3 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years Jim spent in college (4 years) by his annual income before college ($25,000). 

$25,000 * 4 years = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned while in college. 

$50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

To find out how much he earned after college, we need to subtract the total amount of money lost from not working while in school from his new income.

$75,000 (new income) - $100,000 (lost income) = -$25,000 (he actually lost $25,000)

However, we are interested in the amount he earned after college, so we will add the amount he earned while in college to his new income.

$75,000 (new income) + $200,000 (earned while in college) = $275,000

Now, we need to find out how many years it would take for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. 

$275,000 (total amount earned) / $50,000 (annual income) = 5.5 years

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * 2 = $4, and then he won $1 more than that, so he won $4 + $1 = $5. Since he won $5, he didn't lose any money in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $5 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $5 = $7.5 in the third race.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $7.5 (third race) = $12.5.

To find the average, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $12.5 / 3 = $4.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $4.17."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 13000

The total population in South America is 13,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we can calculate the total hours worked in a day as follows:

1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of 24 hours = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we need to multiply the hours worked in a day by the number of days:

3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days
Total hours worked in 21 days = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008: 
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009: 
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * Depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,318
= $12,482

Year 2010: 
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * Depreciation rate)
= $12,482 - ($12,482 * 0.21)
= $12,482 - $2,618.82
= $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,863.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the number of books written in English and German.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.
Number of Spanish books = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20

The number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

1955 - 325 = 1630

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it's $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt). 

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 
The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 
$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is:
3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he has collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he now has 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, the total number of stickers Leo has now is 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's slices: 
10 - 3 = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find Silvia's slices:
7 * 2 = 14

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices together:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"To find out how long Betsy's part was, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.
The cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hours (since the visit is 30 minutes) = $150.
The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.
The cost of the parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, he responds to 64 emails per day. 

64 emails per day * 5 days = 320 emails per week.

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total amount of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2, which is 3. So, he will pay for 3 pounds of butter and get 3 pounds for free.

The cost of 3 pounds of butter is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is 25 + 7 = 32. She also invited 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

So, the total number of guests is 32 + 13 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is $125 (for the initial 20 guests) + $126 (for the additional guests) = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they initially had.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, that means she spent 1/4 of her money. Let's call the amount of money Maggie had 'x'. Then, the amount she spent is x/4.

Riza spent 1/3 of her money, so the amount she spent is x/3.

We know that Maggie and Riza each had $60. Since they spent their money, we can set up the equation:

x - x/4 = 60
x - x/3 = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12 (the least common multiple of 4 and 3):

12x - 3x = 720
9x = 720
x = 80

So Maggie had $80 initially. Now, we can find out how much she spent:

x/4 = 80/4 = 20

Maggie spent $20.

Now, we can find out how much money Maggie has left:

80 - 20 = 60

Riza also had $80 initially. We can find out how much she spent:

x/3 = 80/3 = 26.67

Riza spent $26.67.

Now, we can find out how much money Riza has left:

80 - 26.67 = 53.33

Since Maggie and Riza have the same amount of money left, they both have $60.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (since 15 is 1.25 times a dozen) = $18.75.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she will need to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75 in total.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. For the remaining 75 cents, we need 3 quarters (since 3 * 25 = 75).

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:
- The first train leaves at 30 minutes.
- Paul waits for the second train, which leaves at 65 minutes. So, he waits for 65 - 30 = 35 minutes.
- Paul waits for the third train, which leaves at 125 minutes. So, he waits for 125 - 65 = 60 minutes.
- Paul waits for the fourth train, which leaves at 145 minutes. So, he waits for 145 - 125 = 20 minutes.

The total waiting time for Paul is 35 + 60 + 20 = 115 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. We can set up the equation:

Sale price = Original price * 1.20
Sale price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Sale price = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we are looking for the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the sale price is higher than the original price, which means there is actually a markup, not a discount."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours, and then multiply that by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total time is twice the time it took him to walk to the store.

Total time = 2 * 0.5 hours
Total time = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, there are a total of 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years.

Growth rate = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the growth rate by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which is 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract them from the total to find the number of MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on classes per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is 17.6875."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Since the velociraptors ate half of it, they ate x/2 kilograms. 

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms. 

To find the initial amount, we multiply the amount the T-Rex ate by 2: 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

So, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 2 (unshaken sodas) = 3 sodas.

So, the likelihood is 1/3 or 33.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to first calculate the total number of days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March, and he takes 20% of those days off. 20% of 31 is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days. 

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day. 

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people
Number of people in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Total number of people: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people

The church was not mentioned to be empty, so we can assume that all the people were inside the church."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of returned item: $15.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $58.00

Initial charge: $85.00
Refund for returned item: $15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
New total cost: $58.00
New balance: $70.00 + $58.00 = $128.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. We already know that the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Caroline is 24 years old.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

To find out how much she saves each year, we subtract her annual expenses from her annual income:
$100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take Lauren to save $1,000,000 for retirement. We can do this by dividing the target amount by her annual savings:
$1,000,000 / $60,000 = 16.67 years.

Since Lauren can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 17 years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to first find the total number of boys and then divide it by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 0.4).

We know that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's set up an equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we'll divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we'll subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But this is not possible since she has $2 left. This means the initial $4 she spent was not the total amount she spent on the books. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Anna had $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. She then spent $2 on the books, leaving her with $12 - $2 = $10. Since she has $2 left, it means she actually spent $10 - $2 = $8 on the books. 

Since she bought 2 books for $8, we can divide $8 by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$8 ÷ 2 = $4

The final answer is 4."

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10).

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight per box.

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16.

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 by 4 to get the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

Each log is cut into 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Let's say it takes her x minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. Then, it takes her 2x minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach. We know that 2x = 40 minutes, so we can solve for x:

2x = 40
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Now, we know that it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach, and it takes her twice as long to walk on the sidewalk. So, it takes her 2 * 20 = 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can multiply the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk by 1:

40 minutes

To find out how long it takes her to walk 2 miles on the sidewalk, we can multiply the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk by 2:

40 * 2 = 80 minutes

Now, we can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk:

40 minutes (beach) + 80 minutes (sidewalk) = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny has 2 mugs of water initially. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. Let's assume the unknown mug is x degrees.

The total amount of water Donny has is 2 mugs, which is 2 ounces per mug. After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, he has 2 - 4 = 2 ounces left in the 33-degree mug.

He also poured 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, so he has 1 ounce left in the unknown mug.

The total amount of water Donny has now is 2 ounces (from the 33-degree mug) + 1 ounce (from the unknown mug) = 3 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water now, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the temperature of the unknown mug is x degrees. The total amount of water in the unknown mug is 1 ounce, and the temperature of the water is x degrees.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(1 ounce) * (x degrees) = 3 ounces

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1 ounce:

x = 3

So, the unknown mug is 3 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 ÷ 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 / 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his money, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 7 = $84.

Now, let's calculate the loss. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue: 100 - 84 = $16.

Adam loses $16.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Since Carlos collected 5 more seashells than Jim, and Jim collected 27 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by adding 5 to Jim's total. 
Carlos collected 27 + 5 = 32 seashells.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide Carlos' total by 2. 
Carrey collected 32 / 2 = 16 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells. 
Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 32 (Carlos) + 16 (Carrey) = 75 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. 
Seashells per person = 75 / 3 = 25.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the maximum number of bottles they can produce and then calculate the difference.

The maximum number of bottles Hortex can produce is 4200. 

Let's recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 4200 * (2300 * 0.2) / 2300

x = 4200 * 0.2

x = 840

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 840 - 4200 = -3360

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 4200 * (2300 * 0.2) / 2300

x = 4200 * 0.2

x = 840

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, and the total demand is 840 bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

4200 (current production) - 840 (total demand) = 3360

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, that means 3/4 of 8 babies are wearing purple. 
3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.

Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we need to find 1/3 of 6.
1/3 * 6 = 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows, and 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows, we can assume that the remaining 1/3 of the purple wearers (2 babies) are wearing bows, and the 2 babies wearing both purple and bows are already included in this count. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 1/3 * 6 = 2 + 2 = 4 babies.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
The probability is the number of babies wearing both purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) apartments. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the total number of apartments: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 3120 * 0.40 = $1248 per week.

2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100, which is $20.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into R = 4B, we get R = 4(Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 and R = 4(Y - 7) into the equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find R: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much money Rissa was given. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she was left with 4/5 of her original amount. 

Let's find out how much money Rissa had left: 
4/5 * 15 = 12

Now, we know that Rissa gave 15 - 12 = $3 to her sister.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars.

Ronnie was given 5 dollars initially, so she has 5 - 3 = $2 left.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + x = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, the amount of each color (red, white, and purple) is 3 pints. Since we want to find the amount of red paint used, the answer is:

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

100 (regular box) * 1.2 (20% increase) = 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box contains 120 pods. We also know that you can run 1 cycle per pod. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the new box.

Cost of the new box = $12
Number of pods in the new box = 120

Number of cycles = Number of pods / Cost of the new box
= 120 / 12
= 10

So, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

20% of 2.25 inches = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, the remaining chalk is 0 inches. 

0.45 inches (used in the next 'x' days) = 0 inches (remaining chalk)

0.45 = 0

This equation doesn't make sense, so we need to rephrase it. Let's say the teacher uses 0.45 inches in 'x' days. 

0.20 * 5 * x = 2.25 - 0.45

0.20 * 5 * x = 1.80

x = 1.80 / (0.20 * 5)
x = 1.80 / 1
x = 1.8

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

x = 2 days

The teacher will have 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total with $27,000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide $27,000 by $500 to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since he has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3:

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100:

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
6 cheese pizza slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 cheese pizza slices
4 pepperoni pizza slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 pepperoni pizza slices

Total slices eaten = 36 + 24 = 60 slices

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, we divide 60 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs:
60 / 12 = 5

Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we divide 24 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs:
24 / 8 = 3

Kate needs 5 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. To find the total number of pizzas, we add these together:
5 + 3 = 8

Kate needs to buy 8 pizzas."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 bandages. So, they had x - 16 + 100 - 50 = x + 34 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 34 = 78

Subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 44

So, the nurses started with 44 bandages on the first day.

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. This expression is equal to 40.

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we need to find the total number of balloons. Since there are 10 packs with 30 balloons per pack, we multiply 10 by 30.

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Now, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons.

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to first find the amount of each medicine in one dose.

For the first medicine, Saanvi uses 14 mL.
For the second medicine, she uses 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, she uses 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
John's class capacity = 15 * 2 = 30
Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school = 30 * 2 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's class capacity + John's school capacity = 120 + 60 = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he will pay in 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the sum of the interest and the amount he paid in the first 11 months, which is $275 + $6 = $281.

The final answer is: $281"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 x 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. Half of 10 is 5.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

The final answer is: 765"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at each station.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is 5 * $2 = $10.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. So, the total cost for 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $10 + $15 = $25.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room. Each group uses 45 minutes, and we have 3 groups:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

The final answer is 135."

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is x.

Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues she receives from each magazine.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 x 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from the standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons with the veteran, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

The total amount Charlie will make for the day is the sum of the amount from the standard lessons and the amount from the lessons with the veteran, which is $320 + $120 = $440.

"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

So, Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each.

27 apples * $3 = $81

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, he traveled for 3 days, which is 72 hours.

Distance covered = Average speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he buys 1 box per week, so the pasta cost per week is $1.00.

The cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. So, the total cheese cost per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent cleaning to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

The custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the total number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase can hold 45 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide 110 by 45.

110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls it takes to get 1 customer, we divide 25 by 1. This gives us 25 calls per customer.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars, we divide 15 by 1. This gives us 15 customers.

Now, we know that it takes 25 calls to get 1 customer, and we need 15 customers to sell 15 cars. To find out how many calls Jason needs to make, we multiply the number of customers needed by the number of calls per customer. This gives us 15 * 25 = 375 calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 375 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles and half have 5 medium candles. 

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 small candles per room, so that's 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 
For the other 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 5 medium candles per room, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights.

"To find the total time, let's break down the time it takes to complete each side:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

So, there are 40 robots.

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total items = 40 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs)
Total items = 100

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.
8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.
The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent hopping = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent hopping = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent hopping = 5 minutes

Time spent swimming = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent swimming = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent swimming = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent hopping + Time spent swimming
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

The cost of the four additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since June has 30 days, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can multiply the number of days by the number of doughnuts per day.

10 dozen doughnuts = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day
120 doughnuts per day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut.

3600 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $7200

Derrick makes $7200 in June."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

So, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos.

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we can use the formula: time = total words / speed.

time = 4500 / 375
time = 12 hours

The answer is 12."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw from the 4th day to the 7th day. Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, and there are 4 days left, the total number of people is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week: 
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 60 seconds is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds.
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in the first 90 seconds is 80 + 240 = 320.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate of the past 30 seconds was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds.
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in 120 seconds is 320 + 120 = 440.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.
   So, 30 more kernels pop from the residual heat.
   The total number of kernels popped is 440 + 30 = 470.

Garrett has 470 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, so:
2 * 1 cup = 2 cups
2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, let's multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs belongs to one animal, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.

The tower has 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Total number of blue and yellow blocks
= 32 - 12
= 20

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The number of pink candies is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights:

To find the cost of the bus trips, we need to calculate 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel:
10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips:
$8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost:
$240 + $56 = $296

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4 of them. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping the marbles, he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12, and there is 1 adult, so the total cost for the adult ticket is 1 * $12 = $12.

The cost of the child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is 1 * $8 = $8.

The cost of 2 popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 (adult ticket) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 (since there are 28 days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add 18 to 36, resulting in 54 seeds for the large sunflower.

Now, we add the seeds from both sunflowers: 36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"". 

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The discount on each T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. 
So, the price of each T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4. 
Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $4 = $8.

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16. 
So, the price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down Randy's cookie situation step by step:

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

Now, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

So, Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each), Matthew would earn 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each), Matthew would earn 6 * 7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School.

3/4 of 4000 is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000.

The difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School is 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, let's solve for B: 8 + B + 16 = 29
B + 24 = 29
B = 5

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (7 - 5 = 2)."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs.
The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

So, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together.

30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance, which is 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes
Speed = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Vanessa runs twice as fast as Aaron, her speed is 2 times Aaron's speed:
Vanessa's speed = 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 miles per minute

Now, we know Vanessa's speed and the distance she ran (4 miles). We can calculate the time she took to complete her part of the race:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/4 miles per minute)
Time = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract that from the total amount needed.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- 6 reservations per night * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals per night
- 12 meals per night * $5 per meal = $60 per night
- Adding the $5 bottle of wine per night, the total daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65 per night

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:
$65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we need to find 25% of the total cost and add it to the total cost.

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

Total cost + profit = $80 + $20 = $100

Now, we need to divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons to find the selling price of each watermelon.

$100 / 50 watermelons = $2 per watermelon

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour:

Ana peels: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
Jane peels: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320.
The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours x $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is: $230."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4): 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
