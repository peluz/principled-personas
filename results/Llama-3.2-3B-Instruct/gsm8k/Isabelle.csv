"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so we need to calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000.

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh also put in $50,000 in repairs, so we need to subtract this from the new value to find the profit.

The profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given to the chickens.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken per meal, we need to divide the total feed given so far by 3 to find out how many cups of feed each chicken has received.

40 cups / 3 = 13.33 cups per chicken

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we multiply the amount of feed each chicken has received by the number of chickens.

13.33 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 266.6 cups

Since Wendi can't give a fraction of a cup of feed, we round down to 266 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal. Since she gives 3 cups of feed per chicken, we multiply the number of chickens by 3.

266 cups / 3 = 88.67 cups

Rounding down to the nearest whole number, Wendi needs 88 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: 88"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The first glass costs $5.
The remaining 15 glasses cost 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.
The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file and the time it takes to restart the download:
40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes + 60 minutes = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

3. He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Now, we add up the distances covered in each segment:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

So, John is 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

355"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (5 hours, since she worked 45 hours in total), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to break even. After that, he will start earning a net profit of $7.50 per year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential profit: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
Total value: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential profit: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
Total value: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the total value of the jewelry ($5,125) is greater than the total value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit.

The final numerical answer is: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000

Her annual salary from coaching: 
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500

Total annual salary: 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she should spend walking the entire trail.

Total time for 12 miles at 4 miles per hour = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to complete the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
= 8 miles / 1 hour
= 8 miles per hour

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When you spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of water to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the 24 liters is 46/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

The final answer is 16.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add up the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the other items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need: 
60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

The distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 15 miles.

So, the distance between the first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: 94"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses together and divide by the number of guesses: 
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

The final answer is 70."

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. We can do this by dividing the cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we can multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Since he spent $30 on video games, he must have had $30 initially. 

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he had initially. We know he sold 13 Lego sets for $195. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we need to divide the total amount he got by the price of each Lego set. 

$195 / $15 = 13.

So, he had 13 Lego sets initially."

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings: 300g / 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. The cost of the beeswax and the wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

Since the net profit is negative, Charlie is actually losing money."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours spent on each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

Total notes = 80 + 220 = 300

Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can find the number of notes in the package by subtracting the remaining notes from the total notes.

Notes in the package = Total notes - Remaining notes
= 300 - 23
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

40 * 1.5 = 60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost per tie:

10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

200 + 600 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of 15 floors. 

3/4 * 15 = 11.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a unit, we'll round down to 11 occupied units.

Now, we'll find the total number of units in the building: 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

The total number of unoccupied units is the difference between the total units and the occupied units:
120 - 11 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14
Total money available: $42

Now, let's divide the total money available by the cost of the ticket and popcorn:
$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, making the final price $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid.
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = approximately 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles per gallon."
"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

There are 4 schools, each with 2 teams (girls' and boys'), making a total of 8 teams. Each team has 5 players, so the total number of players is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams, so the total number of coaches is 8.

The total number of people is the sum of the number of players and coaches: 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 48.

48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the total number of gems: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of boys, we know there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, we can multiply 60 by 2 to get the number of boys: 60 * 2 = 120 boys.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $765 / 3 = $255.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left in the first year is 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to calculate the cost of buying 3 packages of 3 flowers each and then add the cost of 3 additional flowers.
Cost of 3 packages of 3 flowers = 3 * $2.50 = $7.50
Cost of 3 additional flowers = 3 * $1 = $3
Total cost = $7.50 + $3 = $10.50

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost of 9 packages of 2 flowers = 9 * $1 = $9

"To find the number of games won, we need to know the number of games lost. Let's call the number of games lost 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is 22. 

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost is 7, we can find the number of games won:

The cost of the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we first need to calculate the amount of potato salad each adult and child will eat.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half of that, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

Since there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Since there are 5 children, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 
Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds
38 = Gerald's time + 2

Now, we need to find Gerald's original time. 
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 36 seconds.
10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds

Now, we add the 10% improvement to Gerald's original time to find his new time.
Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is 39.6."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used. 

16 / 3 = 5.33 (round down to 5 since we can't use a fraction of a tomato)

So, Freda used 5 cans of tomatoes.

Final answer: 5"
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, and there were originally 30 cars. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day. We know he has 4 more days to complete the remaining 24 pages.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 1 * 5 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water per day, so that's 2 glasses per weekend.

Now, let's add the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:
5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 7

So, John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract it from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. To do that, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, she would have taken on 3 sets * 2 liters/set = 6 liters of water.

The time it took her to row 3 sets of 20 feet is 3 sets * 16 seconds/set = 48 seconds. However, this is not the total time it took her to reach the shore. We know the shore is 64 seconds away, and she took 48 seconds to row 3 sets of 20 feet. So, the remaining time is 64 - 48 = 16 seconds. Since she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the distance she covered in the remaining 16 seconds. 

16 seconds / 16 seconds/20 feet = 1 foot. Since she covered 1 foot in 16 seconds, we can multiply this by 2 to get the total distance she covered in the remaining time, which is 2 feet. 

Now, we can add the 2 feet to the 60 feet she already covered to get the total distance she rowed, which is 62 feet. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can divide 62 feet by 10 to get 6.2 sets of 10 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 6 sets.

6 sets * 2 liters/set = 12 liters of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6 to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we can divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

Number of ducks = 300 / 50 = 6.

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
New selling price = $180 * 1.5 = $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio: 
17.14 * 7 = 120.98 

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
Katy used approximately 120 teaspoons of sugar."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to calculate 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago and subtract it from Adrien's salary.

Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
30% of Adrien's salary four years ago = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago - 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40% from four years ago, we can calculate it as follows:

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
= $40,000 + 0.4 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000

Now, we can find Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% of her salary four years ago to her salary four years ago:

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
= $28,000 + 0.4 * $28,000
= $28,000 + $11,200

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate that as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 30

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can set up the equation:

Number of letters with stamps = (1/3) * Number of letters needing stamps
30 = (1/3) * 60
30 = 20

This means Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we need to find the original number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie put stamps on 20 letters, the original number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is:

Original number of letters = Number of letters with stamps - Number of letters put stamps on

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12.

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time:

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Female Scottish unicorns = Scottish unicorns * 2/3
Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * 2/3
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is equal to 700: Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his total earnings in a week would be 14 * $10 = $140.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items.

The total cost of the food items is: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Total food cost: $2 + $3 = $5

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. 
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total food cost and the total non-food cost plus the tax:
Total cost = $5 + $10 + $1 = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses. 

He needs 2 bottles of bleach per client, and he has 8 clients (3 existing + 5 potential). So, he will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach. 
Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so the total cost of bleach will be 16 * $2 = $32.

He also needs 1 pack of cloths per client, and he has 8 clients. So, he will need 8 packs of cloths. 
Each pack of cloths costs $5, so the total cost of cloths will be 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses will be the sum of the cost of bleach and cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find his profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. 

1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.

Next, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many bees had already returned by this point. We know that 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours. Since 60 bees left, we need to subtract 60 from the 15 that had already returned. 15 - 60 is -45, but since we can't have a negative number of bees, we know that 60 bees left after the 15 that had already returned. This means that 60 - 15 = 45 bees left after the 15 that had already returned.

Now, we know that 45 bees left after the 15 that had already returned. Since 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, we need to subtract 45 from 60 to find out how many bees left in the last 6 hours. 60 - 45 is 15.

Now, we know that 15 bees left in the last 6 hours. Since we are asked how many bees return in the last 6 hours, we need to add the 15 bees that left in the last 6 hours to the 15 bees that had already returned. 15 + 15 is 30.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can find out how much she gave the cashier by adding the change to the total cost of the tickets. 

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The seagull ate 7 fries, so the remaining fries are 14 - 7 = 7.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2. However, since we can't have negative fries, we need to re-evaluate the previous steps.
   Let's re-evaluate step 3. The seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries, but the problem states that the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and the pigeons ate 3 fries each.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

The rolls are 4 inches long, and there are 300 of them. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12. 
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The chocolate croissants are 6 inches long, and there are 120 of them. 
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are 2 feet long, and there are 60 of them. 
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths of all the baked goods together. 
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required for all the apes: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards per trip. She does this 34 times.
80 yards * 34 trips = 2720 yards

Since 2720 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 1220 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is: 
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3, which is 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of an action figure as follows:

1 red car = $4
1 action figure = 1/3 * $4 = $1.33 (approximately)

Now, we know the cost of an action figure. We can calculate the cost of the other items:

5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20
3 action figures = 3 * $1.33 = $4
1 doll = $4

Now, we can add up the costs of all the toys to find the total value:

$20 (red cars) + $4 (action figures) + $4 (doll) = $28

The total value of all the toys is $28.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she would lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the money she would lose by doing her taxes herself:
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she would lose:
$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9

Number of babysitting jobs = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Sandra needs to babysit 5 times."
"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Now we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.
Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs from each group and add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since Sally Four is 8 years old, and Sally Two is 19 years old, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the total age of the two older birds. However, we don't have the total age of the two older birds. 

We can find the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red: 19 + 16 = 35 years.

Now, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red from the total age of all four birds. However, we still don't have the total age of all four birds.

We can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red: 35 - 8 = 27 years.

So, the age of the fourth bird is 27 years.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and the fourth bird (27).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 27 = 70 years.

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays each month, we need to add the minimum payments for all her debts and then multiply by 1.5 (since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum).

Minimum payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we multiply the total by 1.5:
$1000 * 1.5 = $1500

To find the yearly amount, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply those times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds
Total time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes:
95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Converting 5700 seconds to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members. 

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total number of Chinese team members - Number of boys on the Chinese team
= 160 - 60

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

We also know that Jean is two years older than Mark. 
So, Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111 or 11.11%

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. 

Difference = 50% - 11.11% = 38.89%

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 38.89% more than rolling two even numbers in a row."
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide her mom's apples by 2, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since the straw is distributed equally among the rats, we divide the remaining straw by 6 (the number of straw pieces per rat): 90 / 6 = 15

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we divide the number of rats by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the cost of transportation:
Total cost = Total cost + Cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

Total amount of insects per week: 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week: 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the number of trees he planted and the number of trees he chopped down over the 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so over 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so over 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

So, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted them white and put them back out. So now, there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink plastic flamingos. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 x $2 = $10.

Since Violetta has $20, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has: $20 - $10 = $10.

So, Violetta will get $10 in change.

"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

The answer is 120."
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has:
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, since he edits an equal number for both publishers. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, he gets 5 * 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, he gets 6 * 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the award amount of $5000 to his total earnings:

$104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

Since he received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the 5% raise on his total earnings, not on the award amount. To calculate the raise, we need to calculate 5% of his total earnings before the award:

5% of $104,000 = 0.05 * $104,000 = $5,200

Now, let's add the raise to his total earnings:

$105,000 + $5,200 = $110,200

So, John's total earnings for the year would be $110,200.

Final answer: $110,200"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.

The final answer is 31."
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in the bags she bought and add it to the pens she already had.

She had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. 
She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.
She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens she already had to the pens she bought:
22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the average of the six tests, we need to first find the total score of the first five tests. 

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To get an average of 93, the total score of the six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.

Since the total score of the first five tests is 438, the score of the sixth test should be 558 - 438 = 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   The cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she can earn $60 in 12 babysitting sessions, she can afford the jacket and shoes in 12 sessions. However, she needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the same amount."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w = 42.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides, we get 8r = 32.

Divide both sides by 8, we get r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find out how many customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4x = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 4x - 64

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

0 = -64

This means that the equation is true for any value of x. However, we can still find the value of x.

Let's go back to the original statement: the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago. So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 2x - 16

This equation is also true for any value of x. However, we can find the value of x by using the fact that the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water.

Since the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

x - 16 = x - 16

This equation is true for any value of x. However, we can find the value of x by using the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now.

Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4y = 4x

Since the big pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

4y = 4x - 16

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

4y - 4x = -16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

y - x = -4

Since the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

y = x - 16

Substituting this expression for y into the previous equation, we get:

(x - 16) - x = -4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-16 = -4

(x - 16) - x = -4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-16 = -4

This equation is true for any value of x. However, we can find the value of x by using the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now.

Let's go back to the original statement: the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can set up the equation:

4y = 4x

Since the big pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

4y = 4x - 16

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

4y - 4x = -16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

y - x = -4

Since the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

y = x - 16

Substituting this expression for y into the previous equation, we get:

(x - 16) - x = -4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-16 = -4

This equation is true for any value of x. However, we can find the value of x by using the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now.

Since the big pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

4y = 4x - 16

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

4y - 4x = -16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

y - x = -4

Since the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, we can set up the equation:

y = x - 16

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total amount she needs is the cost of the shoes and the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she borrowed. 

The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, the total amount Janeth borrowed is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount borrowed: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses in the vase. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias in the vase.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years. We add 3 to each of their current ages.
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the four students: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards, so the new total is:
90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new total is:
82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
He had 40 water type cards initially and lost 8, so the new number of water type cards is:
40 - 8 = 32

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:

"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can complete per minute, we need to calculate their individual rates.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can add 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours.

"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial 36 watermelons from the total.

120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons.

3/4 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total.

"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave.

So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the snow.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced per vine.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend."
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza.

There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices, so the total number of slices required is 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we need to divide 80 slices by 8 slices per pizza to find the number of pizzas needed.

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. We can calculate the total number of girls in these two classes as follows:

Total number of girls in the first two classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls

Since the total number of girls in the school is 1.5 classes, we can calculate the number of girls in the third class as follows:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - Total number of girls in the first two classes
= 1.5 - 27
= -25.5

However, we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent. The problem statement is incorrect, and we cannot provide a valid answer.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the number of boys in the third class, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of boys in the school = Total number of students - Total number of girls

= 30

Since there are 3 classes, we can calculate the number of boys in each class as follows:

Number of boys in the first class = 20 - 15 = 5
Number of boys in the second class = 20 - 12 = 8
Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - (Number of boys in the first class + Number of boys in the second class)
= 30 - (5 + 8)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals.

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

He divides the new cows equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall now has 240 / 20 = 12 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 12 * 8 = 96.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount Nancy owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has:
44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has:
48 / 2 = 24 bananas

Now, let's add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits is:
52 + 24 = 76

The final answer is: 76"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 66 / 12 = 5.5 cups.

The final answer is 5.5."
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

9,300 * 2/3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, then add the marbles she received from her friend.

5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find the total amount of money the girls have, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find out how much more it is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000
Net proceeds: $400,000 - $368,000 = $32,000

The final answer is: $32,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Now, let's add up the time: 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$75 * 15 = $1125

Now, add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall total:
$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

There are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in all three bags: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms per house and then multiply by the number of windows per bedroom.

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows in the bedrooms

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house.

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 additional windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows.

12 windows in the bedrooms + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines from each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines are Sean's, he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is 2/5 * 80 = 32.
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48.
3. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is 1/2 * 48 = 24.
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24.
5. 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is 5/8 * 24 = 15.
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9.
7. The number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, let's denote their current ages as Mico's age = x and Marco's age = 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10) = 30 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 15 + 30 = 45 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find the total length of the space between the gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

There are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Now, subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by 0.25 to find the number of beads: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in both weeks:
Alani's stories: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's stories: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's stories: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8. 

The answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break down the information given:

Ali has 22 medals.
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

39 = 10x/11

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 11:

39 * 11 = 10x
429 = 10x

Now, divide both sides by 10:

x = 429 / 10
x = 42.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a medal, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the total number of medals given out must be a multiple of 11 (since 10 times less than a multiple of 11 equals 39). 

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 429."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * 5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Isabelle bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates he sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates he sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off by.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The initial bid was $200. Since the bids rose by $50 each time, the next three bids would be $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of the initial bid and the three bids: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

"To calculate the total miles driven per year, we need to calculate the miles driven per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a year.

Miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles (to and from work) = 60 miles
Miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is:
Total bonus = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus:
Total cost = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 * 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

Since the paper is folded in half, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to make a tabloid."

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be:
$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month. So, his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is the same as 0.8). 

20 * 0.8 = 16

So, John lost to 16 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses in one week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

4 weeks"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person eats in a week and then add them up.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs eaten per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 6000.

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, the current population of Chile is 6000 * 2 = 12000.

The final answer is: 12000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 
Now, the total number of marbles is 20 + 8 = 28.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used:

65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the weakening caused by the added cream. The problem states that adding any liquid weakens the coffee, but it doesn't specify the weakening caused by the cream. However, we can assume that the weakening caused by the cream is proportional to the amount added. Since the problem doesn't provide a specific ratio, we can assume that the cream weakens the coffee equally as the ice cube does.

So, the weakening caused by the cream is also 60 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the cream:

60 + 60 = 120 milliliters

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each trade involves 2 old records, we can divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

7 new records / 2 old records per new record = 3.5 old records

Since you can't trade half a record, we can round down to 3 old records per person. 

Now, we multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

3 old records per person * 5 people = 15 old records

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to add the number of people who got on at the first stop to the number of people who got on at the second stop, and then subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop.

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 - 7 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they got 4 rewards. 

The rewards are $1 each, so they got 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the rewards is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total discount is $4 (from the rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The customer spent $43, but they got a total discount of $12. To find out how much they paid, we subtract the discount from the total amount spent:

$43 - $12 = $31

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000. 

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chickens and cows there are.

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can represent the number of cows as 'x' and the number of chickens as '2x'. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:
Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"

7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds

"To find the new distance Tyson runs each day, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new distance Tyson runs each day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

Total distance covered in June = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know John spent 50 hours on vacation. He spent 40% of this time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.

She also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget.

$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming she doesn't charge her friends for the activities), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend.

$60 ÷ $0 = $60

Since we can't divide by zero, we can say that Morgan can invite 60 friends, but in reality, she can invite 59 friends, as she will have $0 left for any additional expenses.

The final answer is 59."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left. This means he had $2 initially, and he spent $2 on gumballs, so he must have had $4 initially.

Billy had $10 initially, and he spent $4 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on candy ($6) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$6 / $1.5 = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 675.

18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. Minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50. We know that 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. 
   To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract 31 from 50. 50 - 31 = 19.

Therefore, 19 customers were kicked out for other reasons.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before. 
We know Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 
So Sara had 4.67 points before. 
Since Erin scored 8 points, Erin had 8 + 4.67 = 12.67 points before.

The final answer is 12.67."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

1. Picture frames: 
   44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   20% of $20 is $4, so the total cost for etching the logo is 44 * $4 = $176
   Total cost for picture frames = $880 + $176 = $1056

2. Pins: 
   2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers:
   1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors
   11 seniors * $12 per cord = $132

Total cost for cords = $132

Total cost for all gifts = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan made his own, he saves 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the materials is $400 - $80 = $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper. 

Total cost = $320 (materials) + $400 (original wallpaper) = $720."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.
3. On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total: 28 + 14 - 6 = 36 pairs.

The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 36."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice, we need to add up the hours for each day.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, 40% of x is the number of faulty pieces. 

0.4x = number of faulty pieces

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, and this is the cost of all the pieces, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = x * cost per piece

We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / x

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for the number of faulty pieces:

0.4x = x * (400,000 / x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.4x = 400,000

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get:

x = 1,000,000

So, the total number of pieces is 1,000,000.

Now, we can find the number of faulty pieces:

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4x
= 0.4 * 1,000,000
= 400,000

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 1,000,000 - 400,000
= 600,000

The cost of functioning pieces is the total amount spent minus the cost of faulty pieces. We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / 1,000,000
= 0.4

Now, we can find the cost of functioning pieces:

Cost of functioning pieces = number of functioning pieces * cost per piece
= 600,000 * 0.4
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

Half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday, and she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday, she picked 2 * 14 = 28 apples on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 28 (Wednesday) = 54 apples

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 - $18 = $18

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to get x = 12.8 * (5/2)

x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

Mark earns $10 per day, so we can divide the bike cost by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to work to save for the bike.

$300 (bike cost) ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

However, Mark is short $250, so he would need to work for 30 days and then have some money left over. 

To find out how much money Mark will have after 30 days, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days:

$10 (daily earnings) x 30 (days) = $300

Since Mark already has $50, he will have a total of $50 + $300 = $350 after 30 days. This means he will have enough money to buy the bike after 30 days of work.

Mark needs to work for 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, calculate 5% of 50,000 candles:
5% of 50,000 = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Then, find 1% of the defective candles (which will explode):
1% of 2,500 = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since they have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps is the sum of the number of humps on camels and dromedaries. We know that camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each. 

We are given that there are 304 bumps in total. So, we can set up the equation:

2C + D = 304

We are also given that there are 180 heads in total. Since each camel has one head and each dromedary has one head, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by solving these equations simultaneously.

First, let's solve the second equation for C:

C = 180 - D

Now, substitute this expression for C into the first equation:

2(180 - D) + D = 304

Expand and simplify:

360 - 2D + D = 304

Combine like terms:

360 - D = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides:

-D = -56

Multiply both sides by -1:

D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the initial elevation of Stanley (10,000 feet) to the distance the comb fell (4,000 feet). 

10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb (14,000 feet) and Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet). 

14,000 - 3,000 = 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is 30 * 3/5 = 18.
4. So, 18 cats ran away, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: $8 per month
   6 months * $8 per month = $48

2. The next 8 months: $12 per month
   8 months * $12 per month = $96

3. The last 8 months: $14 per month
   8 months * $14 per month = $112

Now, let's add up the costs of all three periods:
$48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total amount Cole saved. Since he saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. 

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). 

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
8 - 2 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4.
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs 4 + (25% of 4) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards. He keeps 1/3 of them, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

x = 150

However, this equation doesn't make sense because Kenny can't get $150 from selling 2/3 of his cards. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

x = 150

However, this equation doesn't make sense because Kenny can't get $150 from selling 2/3 of his cards. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = 1.5x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets 1.5x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

1.5x = 150

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 150 / 1.5
x = 100

So, Kenny started with 100 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. Since the caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, that means he had enough hotdogs for 18 * 2 = 36 guests. 

Since 40 guests showed up, and the caterer had enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have two hotdogs, that means 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of 6 is 3. 
Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3. 
3 + 4 = 7

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 
6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons = 15 * 1/4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the total amount of money he had initially. 1% of $5 is 0.01 * 5 = 0.05 dollars. So, he had 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 dollars initially.

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars. We subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount: 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 dollars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can plug these values into the formula:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the final temperature, let's break down the process step by step:

1. Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increases by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.
   The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.
   The new temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

"To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We also know that James won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 10 minutes less than Jon's. 
James' run time is 50 - 10 = 40 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C was 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can multiply the distance by the cost of hay per mile:

Total cost of hay = Distance * Cost per mile
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $3/mile
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six $5 bills, so we need to find out how much he has in total:

Total money = Number of bills * Value per bill
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of hay from the total money to find out how much change Michael has:

Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total cost of hay. The horse runs 16 miles, and it eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile. Since a bail is 2 bales, the horse eats 1 bale of hay per mile. A bale of hay costs $6, so the total cost of hay is:

Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $6
Total cost of hay = $96

Now, we subtract the cost of hay from the total money to find out how much change Michael has:

Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $96
Change = -$66

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total cost of hay. The horse runs 16 miles, and it eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile. Since a bail is 2 bales, the horse eats 1 bale of hay per mile. A bale of hay costs $6, so the total cost of hay is:

Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $6
Total cost of hay = $96

However, we can simplify the problem by finding the cost of hay per mile and then multiplying it by the number of miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and a bail is 2 bales. So, the horse eats 1 bale of hay per mile. A bale of hay costs $6, so the cost of hay per mile is:

Cost of hay per mile = $6
Cost of hay per mile = $6

Now, we multiply the cost of hay per mile by the number of miles:

Total cost of hay = Cost of hay per mile * Number of miles
Total cost of hay = $6 * 16
Total cost of hay = $96

However, we can simplify the problem by finding the cost of hay per minute. The horse runs 32 miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the horse runs 32/60 miles per minute. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and a bail is 2 bales. So, the horse eats 1 bale of hay per mile. A bale of hay costs $6, so the cost of hay per mile is:

Cost of hay per mile = $6
Cost of hay per mile = $6

Now, we multiply the cost of hay per mile by the number of miles the horse runs per minute:

Cost of hay per minute = Cost of hay per mile * (32 miles/hour / 60 minutes/hour)
Cost of hay per minute = $6 * (32/60)
Cost of hay per minute = $1.60

Now, we multiply the cost of hay per minute by the number of minutes the horse runs:

Total cost of hay = Cost of hay per minute * Number of minutes
Total cost of hay = $1.60 * 30
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six $5 bills, so we need to find out how much he has in total:

Total money = Number of bills * Value per bill
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of hay from the total money to find out how much change Michael has:

Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total cost of hay. The horse runs 16 miles, and it eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile. Since a bail is 2 bales, the horse eats 1 bale of hay per mile. A bale of hay costs $6, so the total cost of hay is:

Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $6
Total cost of hay = $96

However, we can simplify the problem by finding the cost of hay per minute. The horse runs 32 miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the horse runs 32/60 miles per minute. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and a bail is 2 bales. So, the horse eats 1 bale of hay per mile. A bale of hay costs $6, so the cost of hay per mile is:

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each:
48 sneakers - 17 sneakers = 31 sneakers
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and add them together.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $1 (the extra cost of the super ticket) + $3 (the cost of the soda) = $4.

So, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $20 + $2 = $22.

Now, we know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $4. We can set up an equation to find the price of the popcorn:

$12 + P + $3 = $22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$12 + P + $3 = $22
$15 + P = $22
P = $22 - $15
P = $7

The regular price of the popcorn is $7."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the original cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase. 
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 170 * $65 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples per day, and Nancy eats 4 apples per day.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds = 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed = total volume / 2 = 320 / 2 = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost = number of bags * cost per bag = 160 * 12 = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil will be $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
   Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. 
   So, 25 fairies join the initial 50 fairies, making a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   To find the remaining fairies, subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

There are 45 fairies remaining."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add Jennifer's puppies to Brandon's puppies.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Jennifer's puppies with spots: 3
Brandon's puppies with spots: 4
Total puppies with spots: 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we'll divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots: (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4300 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips needed:
4300 / 2250 = 1.9133 (round up to 2 since you can't make a fraction of a trip)

The farmer needs to make 3 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given away (300) by 10 to find the number of students: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. 9 - 8 = 1.

The difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky is 1 dollar."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books.

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books per child

So, each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both to avoid double counting.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, let's subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12
= 20

The number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything is 20.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The answer is 6."
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians. 

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:
Total puppies = 27

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take for him to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car.

"To find the cost of 2 packs of razors, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs without the discount. 

2 packs of razors cost 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. 

The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. 

Now, we need to subtract the $2.00 coupon from the cost of 1 pack of razors. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert the cost to cents. 

$2.00 = 200 cents

So, each individual razor will cost 200 cents after the discount."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 x 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 x 64"" = 192"" (since the 60"" girl is not part of this layer) and then add the 60"" of the 10th girl, so 192"" + 60"" = 252"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 x 64"" = 128"".

Now, let's add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 252"" + 128"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the estimated cost of food. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25x.

To find the point where the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for 'x'.

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:
200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:
10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3:

Number of batches of oatmeal cookies = Total raisins / Raisins per batch
= 27 / (3/4)
= 27 * 4/3
= 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Original daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since half a house takes 5 days).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10/5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has by adding 2 to the number of sofas she has. 

20 (sofas) + 2 = 22 chairs

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3 to find the number of chairs Jenna has.

22 (Ophelia's chairs) * 3 = 66 chairs

Now, we can find the total number of chairs by adding the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have.

22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88 chairs

The total number of sofas is 20, and the total number of chairs is 88.

20 (sofas) + 88 (chairs) = 108"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

The total amount Tom paid is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. 

$48 - $4 = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44.

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

11"

Josh spent a total of 31 hours working out across the 8 weeks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. 3 times fewer than 21 is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

66"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

The total cost of all three items is $2,400. To find the cost of one monitor, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

The cost of one monitor is $600."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 
300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that George has 3 candies left after eating 5. 

Since George had twice as many candies as Nick, we can represent the number of candies George had initially as 2x, where x is the number of candies Nick had. 

We know that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 left, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 5 = 3.

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 8, x = 4.

So, Nick had 4 candies initially. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

To find out how many vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total vlogs needed:
72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, the 3 boys shared $18, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he added another $10, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saved some more money and tripled the amount he had left, which is $13. So, he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the target for the second half of the month: 
$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, we can represent the amount he saves in the first half as 'x'. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is '2x'. 

We know that the total amount he saves in the second half is $562.50, so we can set up the equation: 
2x = 562.50

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 562.50 / 2
x = 281.25

So, Elvis saves $281.25 in the first half of the month. 

To find the amount he needs to save each day in the second half, we can divide the amount he saves in the second half by the number of days in the second half (15):
$562.50 / 15 = $37.50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $37.50 each day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:
5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 
Distance to work is 3 miles, so the distance he walks each day is 3 * 2 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 letters (from step 1) + 13 letters (from step 2) = 65 letters.

So, Elise has written a total of 65 letters."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families notified in each round and then add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:
3 (first round) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120

So, a total of 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the pyramid.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward at 5 degrees per hour, after 10 hours, the angle will increase by 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

So, the new angle of the sun relative to the pyramid will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

However, we need to find the angle from the ground to the sun. Since the pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the new angle of the sun relative to the pyramid.

The final angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 + 32 = 114 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
The second flower shop orders 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
The third flower shop orders 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops:
260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account in that time period.

Since she removes $100 every month, we multiply the monthly amount by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 24 months in 2 years.

$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

$600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 10 / 10 = 1 loaf
Cost of bread = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Since the cost is given per 10 sandwiches, we need to calculate the cost for 10 sandwiches:
Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. 

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Let's add up the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The resulting value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8.
5. The resulting value from step 3 is multiplied by the result from step 4: 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to add 4% to the set temperature to get the correct temperature. 

First, we need to convert 4% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 
4 / 100 = 0.04

Now, we add 0.04 to the set temperature: 
450 + 0.04 = 450.04

So, Maggie should set her oven to 450.04 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 90 minutes.
The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, let's add the lengths of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 
10% of $100.00 is $10.00, so the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can find the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the number of pairs. 
There are 90 contacts in 2 boxes, so there are 90 / 2 = 45 pairs.

The cost of each pair of contacts is $180.00 / 45 = $4.00.

The final answer is $4."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 words, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM.
Then, he increases his speed by 5 words again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57 WPM. 
To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited brought 2 friends, so the total number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, so the total number of additional people is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than Mark's window height of 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount:

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

Cost per pump = $0.20 per washing / 60 washings = $0.00333 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.00333 * 100 = 0.33 cents per pump.

The final answer is 0.33."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 by 12:

28 * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost for Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95038

Since we are asked how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

Cost for Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $95038 - $29,100 = $92138

The final answer is: $92138"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 + 50% of $100,000, which is $150,000. 
The funding for the 7th month is $150,000 + 50% of $150,000, which is $225,000. 
The funding for the 8th month is $225,000 + 50% of $225,000, which is $337,500. 
The funding for the 9th month is $337,500 + 50% of $337,500, which is $506,250. 
The funding for the 10th month is $506,250 + 50% of $506,250, which is $753,750.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $753,750 = $2,277,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,277,000 = $2,777,000

So, the total cost of John's research is $2,777,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so 8 ounces of meat.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Total number of posts per day = 3
Total number of days in March = 31

The group will have 93 posts in March."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of water used per year. A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

The final answer is: $312"

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

"To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by students:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, so the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions.

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x $14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb/hour

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. 
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed.
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's calculate the difference: 48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The cost of the cars for James is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000. 

The profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500. 

James got a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $17,500 = $1,750. 

Therefore, James made $1,750."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get 25 riders.

Now, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 to get 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels.
Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers, so Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary is his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. Let's call the sales of green hats 'x'. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, the sales of red hats are x/2.

The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats: x + x/2 = 3x/2.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * 3x/2 = 9x/8.

The total sales for two months is the sum of the sales of the first and second months: 3x/2 + 9x/8.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. So, we convert 3x/2 to 12x/8. 

Now, we can add: 12x/8 + 9x/8 = 21x/8.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is 21x/8."

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, the cooking time for beans is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of other items) = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers. 

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 3 more good days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 3 = 23.

Since Christina had 30 days in total, we subtract the total number of good and bad days from 30 to find the number of neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

Now, we know that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 24 days. We have 30 - 24 = 6 days left.

Since the next 3 days were good, we subtract these from the remaining 6 days: 6 - 3 = 3.

So, there are 3 good days left in the month.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x:

2x + 3 = 21
2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18
x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since there are twice as many dogs as when James left, the number of dogs is now 2 * 12 = 24.

However, 3 dogs were gone, so the current number of dogs is 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find out how much money was invested by each person, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left for Skyler's investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

So, Skyler's investment was 240 dollars.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending it by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are two sets of siblings: one twin and one triplet.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

Let's denote the age of the triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 37

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18.5

Since x represents the age of the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5.

The final answer is 25.5."

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount raised.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount raised.

$4200 / $2100 = 2

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. 

Let's assume the total percentage of the river's water used by the city is x. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can set up the equation:

80% of x = 40%

To solve for x, we can convert the percentages to decimals and divide both sides by 0.8:

0.8x = 0.4

x = 0.4 / 0.8
x = 0.5

Now that we know the total percentage of the river's water used by the city, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 100%:

100% - 80% = 20%

So, 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be 14 * 12 = $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of the croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of the cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of the mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, let's apply the 10% discount: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00
The total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops for free. So, she can buy 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free.

The total number of scoops she can buy is 4, but she can only use 2 scoops. 

The answer is 4."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 compared to buying at the store."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers they bought.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

Eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories
Cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories
Ham: 2 oz * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories

Total calories in the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

The omelet has 770 calories."

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

In the first 3 minutes, Helga taps both feet at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. So, in 3 minutes, she taps 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

In the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps both feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute. So, in 2 minutes, she taps 200 * 2 = 400 times.

Now, we add the total number of taps in both scenarios: 1650 + 400 = 2050.

The final answer is: 2050"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

The correct answer is - $255."
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Total normal chairs: 170
Total baby chairs: 23
Total chairs: 170 + 23 = 193

Chairs sent for repair: 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Chairs left: 193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12: (4/3) x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches: 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe in inches: 
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10 

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

The remaining people who had not voted by midday are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted between midday and 16:00.

Now, add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, let's add their ages together: 
Dora's age + her father's age + her mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity per year and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. There are 12 months in a year, so the total cost of electricity per year is:
$100 * 12 = $1200

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of roommates:
$1200 / 4 = $300

So each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates and then subtract the number of broken ones.

Initial glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Broken glasses: 10
Broken plates: 6

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches he played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
He played 1 match on Friday.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation 'x'. 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the discount amount, multiply the marked price by the discount percentage (as a decimal). 

Discount = 5% of $140 = 0.05 * $140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price to find the final price.

Final price = Marked price - Discount
= $140 - $7
= $133

The final price you will pay is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists: 20
Number of songs in each playlist: 300
Length of each song: 10 hours

Total number of songs: 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours: 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we first need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win and how many people think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find out how many people are remaining after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - people who think horse #2 will win - people who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up an equation to find the total number of puppies:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, we can calculate it as follows:
1/2 * 250 = 125 cases

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we multiply 125 by 2:
125 * 2 = 250 cases

The third house will need 250 cases of shingles.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent is $14."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to 200.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears: 200 + 290 = 490.

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges he needs for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms, 4 liters will require 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Since each kilogram costs $3, the total cost will be 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially, then he read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we divide 450 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

To find the total number of books read, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed: 450 + 225 = 675.

The final answer is: 675"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

To find the total earnings for the two days, we need to add the earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
$300 + $60 = $360

Tanya earned $360 for these two days of teaching.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents."
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: 135 - 60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): 75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   So, he had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   So, he had 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= (400 - 160) * 10
= 240 * 10
= $2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

The Llesis family drove at 50 miles per hour. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

5 miles per hour less than 25 miles per hour is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. 

Distance = speed * time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so Ava jumps on 8 + 8 = 16 enemies. Emma jumps on 16 - 8 = 8 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. 

Emma's score is 8 * 10 + 15 + (60 - 4) = 80 + 15 + 56 = 151 points.
Ava's score is 16 * 10 + 12 + (60 + 4) = 160 + 12 + 64 = 236 points.

The difference between their scores is 236 - 151 = 85 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that 17 fish must be a combination of both orange and white fish. 

Let's say the number of white fish taken out is x. Then the number of orange fish taken out is 17 - x.

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out some fish, he had 3 - (17 - x) orange fish and 4 - x white fish.

Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - (17 - x) = 2(4 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 - 17 + x = 8 - 2x

Combine like terms:

-14 + x = 8 - 2x

Add 2x to both sides:

-14 + 3x = 8

Add 14 to both sides:

3x = 22

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 22/3

x is not a whole number, but since you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can solve it exactly.

x = 22/3

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

The value of the quarters is 140 quarters * $0.25 = $35.

The value of the twenties she spent is 3/5 * 10 twenties = 6 twenties.
Since 1 twenty is $20, the value of the twenties she spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money she paid for lunch is $35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people, then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people: 172

People who got on at the first stop: 13
People left after the first stop: 172 - 47 + 13 = 128

People who got off at the next stop: 38
People left after the second stop: 128 - 38 = 90

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month.
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Then, multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
300 bottle caps * $0.25 = $75

Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours (11 - 8 = 3), her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

So, her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in the first month: 200 employees * $4000 = $800,000
Total amount paid in the second month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in the third month: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000

Total amount paid in three months: $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

The final answer is: $2,640,000"

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys.
The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.
The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify the equation:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3
x = 0.3(14 + x)
x = 4.2 + 0.3x
0.7x = 4.2
x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them. 

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 
The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold. 
$900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 square inches long.

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower: 
- 3 - 1 = 2
- 4 - 1 = 3
- 5 - 1 = 4
- 6 - 1 = 5

Now, let's add the remaining number of petals for each type of flower: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14 petals

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Total S'mores they can make = 17
Number of kids = 2

S'mores per kid = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

John can have 8 S'mores.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts.

Let's assume the cost of a quarter is $0.25.

Jack can play for 20 minutes, which is 1/3 of an hour. 
His friends can play for half that time, which is 1/6 of an hour. 
The better friend can play for 1.5 times that, which is 1/4 of an hour.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays in 4 hours:
- Jack: 4 hours * (1/3) = 4/3 hours
- Friend 1: 4 hours * (1/6) = 4/3 hours
- Friend 2: 4 hours * (1/4) = 1 hour

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours.

- Jack: 4 hours * (1/3) = 4/3 hours = 1.33 quarters
- Friend 1: 4 hours * (1/6) = 4/3 hours = 1.33 quarters
- Friend 2: 4 hours * (1/4) = 1 hour = 4 quarters

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 1.33 quarters
- Friend 1: 1.33 quarters
- Friend 2: 4 quarters
Total quarters used: 1.33 + 1.33 + 4 = 6.66 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is:
6.66 quarters * $0.25 = $1.665

The final answer is: $1.665"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since S = G and Z = F, we can substitute S for G and Z for F in the equation S = 2Z. This gives us S = 2S, which means S = 0. However, this is not possible since S cannot be zero. This indicates that the initial assumption that S = G and Z = F is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. We know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. We can substitute S = 2Z into the equation O = 2S, which gives us O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation: S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting S = 2Z and G = S, we get:
2Z + O + Z + 2Z = 10
Combine like terms:
5Z + O = 10

We also know that O = 4Z. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
5Z + 4Z = 10
Combine like terms:
9Z = 10

Divide both sides by 9:
Z = 10/9

Now that we know Z, we can find O:
O = 4Z
O = 4(10/9)
O = 40/9

To convert this to a decimal, divide 40 by 9:
O ≈ 4.44

The final answer is 4.44."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed: 63
Cupcakes already has: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40. 
20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students, we divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first.

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we know she scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Then, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is 0.35 dollars per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost is 0.35 * 4 = 1.40 dollars.

The book is 20 miles away, and the shipping cost is 0.08 dollars per mile, so the shipping cost is 0.08 * 20 = 1.60 dollars.

The total shipping cost is 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 dollars.

The book originally cost 32 dollars, but Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund will be 0.75 * 32 = 24 dollars.

To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund from the original cost and add the shipping cost. So, the amount Milly will lose is 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 dollars.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan started with $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, it means she is in debt."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends on each activity: 72 videos (recording) + 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

The final answer is: 86"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up a proportion to relate the time it takes for the kangaroos to the time it takes for the turtles.

Time taken by kangaroos / Speed of kangaroo = Time taken by turtles / Speed of turtle
18 hours / 6 hours = x hours / 3 hours
x = (18 hours * 3 hours) / 6 hours
x = 9 hours

Therefore, it will take four turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how many clay dishes they all make together, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as x.

We know that after all these transactions, Erika only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. So, the total amount she has is equal to the price of the laptop minus the amount she needs: x = $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x = $150 (job pay) + $80 (mom's help) + x (initial savings). However, we don't know the initial amount of savings, so we can simplify the equation by combining the known values: x = $230 + x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting x from both sides: x - x = $230, which simplifies to 0 = $230. However, this is not possible, as Erika has some savings. Let's re-examine the equation.

The correct equation should be: x = $150 (job pay) + $80 (mom's help) + x (initial savings). Since we know that Erika only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up the equation as follows: x = $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as: x = $150 + $80 + x. To isolate x, we need to get rid of the x on the right side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting x from both sides: x - x = $230. This simplifies to 0 = $230, which is still not possible.

Let's re-examine the situation. We know that Erika has some savings, and we know that she has been paid $150 and received $80 from her mom. We also know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. The correct approach is to find the total amount she has after receiving the help from her mom and subtracting the amount she needs.

The total amount she has after receiving the help from her mom is $150 (job pay) + $80 (mom's help) = $230. Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up the equation as follows: $230 + x = $400.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting $230 from both sides: x = $400 - $230 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces per day (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows needed.

5 cows - 3 cows = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills. 

Four $20 bills equal 4 * $20 = $80.

The hat costs $70, so the change Thea got is $80 - $70 = $10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

To find the total number of dishes, we know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $225 = $750.

For the third year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 3 years is $750 + $225 = $975.

= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and 10 goats were sold, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Farm Y had 45 goats and twice as many goats were sold, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Then, my brother's age is x + 3, and my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of our ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age can't be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the ages are whole numbers, so we should find whole number solutions.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs: 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.
Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.
Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how much money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 
40 customers * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total.
10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80
Rafaela's tips: $800 - $80 = $720
Julieta's tips: $720 - $80 = $640

To find the total amount of tips received by both, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips.
Total tips = $720 + $640 = $1360

The final answer is: $1360"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer had 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Then, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20. So, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know that the carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Now, we need to divide this amount by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we multiply 60 by 2/5.

60 * 2/5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.

60 - 24 = 36

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To do this, we multiply 26 by 7/13.

26 * 7/13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day.

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we need to first find 80% of the total microphones, since 20% won't fit.

Total microphones = 50
Percentage of microphones that won't fit = 20%
Number of microphones that won't fit = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs = Total microphones - Number of microphones that won't fit
= 50 - 10
= 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we need to divide the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Whatchamacallit speed = 11 * Thingamabob speed

We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

121 = 11 * Thingamabob speed

To find the thingamabob speed, we can divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob speed, we can find the whirligig speed by multiplying it by 5:

Whirligig speed = 5 * Thingamabob speed
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We can subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

$11 (total) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 13 * 6 = 78
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * 13 * 6 = 234
- Alba's lawn: 5 * 13 * 6 = 390

Total amount from mowing lawns: 78 + 234 + 390 = 702

Now, let's subtract the total amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $702 = -$622

However, this is not possible since she made $80 from mowing lawns. This means that the information about the amount she earned from mowing lawns is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total amount she made is $80, and she earned $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. We can subtract $6 from $80 to find the amount she made from lemonade sales:

$80 - $6 = $74

The final answer is: 74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
10 rentals * 3 hours per rental * $25 per hour = 10 * 3 * 25 = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
$750 - $500 = $250

So, John's monthly profit is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 
3x = 7, where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3, which is approximately 2.33. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks for Joseph.

Now, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2 notebooks. 
7 - 2 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis' distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 + 1/5, which is 6/5. 

Anis' distance = 50 * (6/5) = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance by adding Dijana's and Anis' distances.

Total distance = 50 + 60 = 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took. 

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: 
96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 
Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 18 - 13 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, and Calvin is an adult, we can assume that the pot can fill 4 adult bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 + 2 = 6 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can fill 6 bowls in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls are left after everyone has eaten. Calvin, his wife, and their two children ate 6 bowls. 

So, 6 bowls are left. 

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, we can divide 6 by 8 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

6 / 8 = 0.75 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can round down to 0. 

However, in this case, we can say that each child can have 0.75 bowls of soup for lunch, which is equivalent to 0 full bowls and 3/4 of a bowl."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

The total amount William spent is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 visits per movie = 27 tickets

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, let's subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 

7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used blue shoe boxes) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes and subtract that from the total number of red shoe boxes.

1/3 of 9 (total red shoe boxes) is 3. 
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (used red shoe boxes) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

4"
"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from 18. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write an equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write another equation:

D = 60

Now we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A - 8 + 8
60 = 2A

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:

60/2 = 2A/2
30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we need to add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that would be 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 * 20 (bologna at red balloons) + 3 * x (bologna at yellow balloons) = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3x = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5 for 2, the cost of 12 balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) = $14.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $14 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. 

$28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number playing volleyball, so 6 * 2 = 12 students are playing volleyball.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the number of students in each group together: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The total number of students is 56."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, we subtract the cinnamon tea from the total number of cups.

27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea) = 12 cups of mint tea

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, we need to divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3.

12 (mint tea cups) / 3 (rows) = 4 cups of mint tea per row.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips, which equals 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 
Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to multiply the rate by the number of days to find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days.
500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

So, after 6 days, there will be 3000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

3000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$124 / $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156
Total Junebugs removed on Thursday and Friday = 48 + 57 = 105
Total Junebugs removed in 5 days = 39 + 156 + 105 = 300

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

Now, we can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial 10 balloons to the 15 additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2

"To find out how much Cameron would pay, we first need to calculate the number of hours he stays at the hotel. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. So, he stays for 18 hours.

Since he chooses the 12-hour option for the first 12 hours, he pays 1000 pesos. 

For the remaining 6 hours, he adds 70 pesos for each hour. So, he pays 6 * 70 = 420 pesos.

The total amount Cameron pays is 1000 + 420 = 1420 pesos.

To find out how much he would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option. The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos.

Cameron saves 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos.

The final answer is 180."
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide 100 by 25. 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

Number of children in each row = 8
Number of rows = 7

Total number of children = 8 * 7 = 56

There can be 56 children in the drill."
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40 (visit charge) + $60 (parts) = $100

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge
Total cost = $78.75 + $100
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110."
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She started with 15 stickers.
2. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

Commission for the New York Times: 6 copies * 10% * $5 = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3
Commission for the Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * 8% * $15 = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, if Marcus is 21 years old, then Leo's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.
Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she woke up at 5:55 p.m. (10 p.m. - 5 minutes).

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep:
- Time from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 4 hours 15 minutes = 255 minutes
- Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
- Time from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. = 3 hours 17 minutes = 197 minutes

Total time she was asleep = 255 minutes + 23 minutes + 197 minutes = 475 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total time she was asleep:
475 minutes - 5 minutes = 470 minutes

The final answer is: 470"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan also has 24 measuring cups. So, the total number of utensils he has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils.

34"
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
100 + (50 * 14) = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 800 = 200

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to her family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the remainder is 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1"
"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3. 
Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jeffrey carried half of Jason's amount. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the supplies cost and add it to the supplies cost.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given:

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find Stan's catch:
Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each direction and then add them together.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, we subtract the distance traveled from the initial distance to get the net distance traveled north:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, we add the distance traveled to the net distance traveled north:
264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies made and received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), Nani's brother (16), and Nani's sister (6).

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so we need to add 7 to Carlton's team size. 

Carlton's team has 13 players, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total number of wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she had initially.

240 - 4 = 236 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find 1/4 of 236.

1/4 * 236 = 59 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had initially.

240 - 59 = 181 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 181 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 
$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total.

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's total from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (20 + 30)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to convert this to inches as well: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space each plant will occupy: 12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between) = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant occupies: 1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4.

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 flowers * $6/flower = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, we multiply the daily pretzel consumption by 7 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

9 pretzels * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

The total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The final answer is: $70."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 degrees.

So, the net cooling effect is 6 - 12 + 2 = -4 degrees.

The final temperature is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final temperature is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 3(30)

Simplifying the equation:
x + 30 = 90

Subtracting 30 from both sides:
x = 60

So, Bill was 60 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. 

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem states that Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This means that Walter's total amount will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we can calculate the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute. Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, and everyone else includes Walter and his friend, we need to find out how much Walter and his friend have contributed together.

Walter and his friend have contributed $2000 + $200 = $2200. 

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we can calculate the amount as follows: 
$2200 * 3 = $6600.

However, this is the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute if Walter and his friend were the only ones contributing. Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we need to divide this amount by 4 (Walter, his friend, and his lawyer). 

$6600 / 4 = $1650.

The final answer is: $1650"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find out how many people were in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices. 

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

We know that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's assume the kid's slice is x. Then, the adult's slice is 2x.

Since there are 4 kids, the total area of their slices is 4x. The total area of the adult's slices is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total area of the slices is the area of the whole watermelon, which we can represent as 6x (since there are 6 slices in total). 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 4x = 6x

Simplifying the equation, we get 8x = 6x, which means x = 0. 

Now, we know the area of each kid's slice is 0. Since each adult's slice is twice as big, the area of each adult's slice is 2 * 0 = 0.

However, this doesn't make sense, as we can't have a slice with zero area. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's say the total area of the watermelon is A. The area of each kid's slice is x, and the area of each adult's slice is 2x.

Since there are 4 kids, the total area of their slices is 4x. The total area of the adult's slices is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know that the total area of the slices is the area of the whole watermelon, so we can set up the equation: 4x + 4x = A

Simplifying the equation, we get 8x = A

Now, we know the area of each kid's slice is x, and the area of each adult's slice is 2x. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the area of the adult's slice by the total area of the watermelon and multiply by 100.

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x / A) * 100 = (2x / 8x) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars sold / Total boxes sold
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the monthly cost, which is $480 - $480 = $0.

The final answer is $0."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract Martha's number from Peter's number: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61916 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61916 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6191.60

The final answer is: $6191.60"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

Number of red sticks = 9
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the number of hours they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. 

450 - 220 = 230

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons were pumped.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons were pumped.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The final answer is 94."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide the total hours by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

The total amount spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10 and spent $10.25, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, since he can't spend more than he has, we need to recalculate the total spent.

Let's recalculate the total spent on other fruits:
He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

The total amount spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar can't spend more than he has, let's subtract the total spent from his initial amount:
$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

However, we can see that Jamaar actually spent more than he had. This means he can't buy any more fruits."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

27

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to first determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

James reads 18 pages, and since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

18 / 3 = 6

Since it takes him 10 minutes to read each set of 3 pages, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes.

6 * 10 = 60

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The number of guests remaining is now 61 + 30 = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 = 27 points."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total amount earned from large stuffed animals. Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is y. Then, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12y.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y.

The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2y * 4 = 8y.

We know that the total amount earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine like terms:

20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

y = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

Number of small stuffed animals = 2y = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply 11 sandwiches per day by 7 days in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found, so the number of eggs that were found is 100 - 10 = 90.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found from the total number of eggs that were found: 90 - 60 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we multiply the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe by 40 dwarves and 30 days: 
40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

The final answer is 43,200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   25 red balloons * 40% = 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the remaining red balloons:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   12 yellow balloons * 0.5 = 6 yellow balloons released.

4. Calculate the remaining yellow balloons:
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   8 blue balloons * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons added.

6. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
   15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%. 

80%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 
150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Melissa's daily income: $15 per day
Melissa's daily expenses: $3 per day

Total daily income: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216

Now, let's calculate her hourly wage after expenses:
$216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour

"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box. 

Two boxes of apples * 40 apples per box = 80 apples

80 apples / 8 apples per pack = 10 packs

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school, we need to find out how much he would have earned if he had worked during those 4 years. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money he would have earned if he had worked during college:
$25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income would be:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost while in school:
$100,000 (lost income) - $50,000 (loans) = $50,000

To find out how long it would take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost, we need to divide the total amount by his new income:
$50,000 / $75,000 = 0.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 0.67 years, or about 8 months, to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school."
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * 2 - $5 = $4 - $5 = -$1.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * -1 = $-1.5.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost: $5 + $1.5 + $1.5 = $8.

To find the average, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $8 / 3 = $2.67.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $2.67."

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 13000

The total population in South America is 13,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours worked per day by 7 (the number of days in a week): 9 hours/day * 7 days/week = 63 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters: 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours per painter.

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German.

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

There are 20 Spanish books."

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."

"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt). 

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

$192 * 12 = $2304

James pays $2304 a year."
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 
Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's total by 2 to find Silvia's total. 
Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by all three: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 31."
"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the visit costs $300/2 = $150.

The cast costs $200.

The painkillers cost $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the painkillers cost 30 * $4 = $120.

The parking costs $6/hour for 2 hours, so the parking costs 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter required for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter required by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00 and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

The total cost will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost = $125 + (21 * $6) = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 of $60 is $15.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 of $60 is $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount they had:
$120 - $35 = $85.

So, Maggie and Riza have $85 left.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he finished in that hour. 

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, that's 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. 

So, the total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses would cost 15 / 12 * 15 = $18.75. 

Jenny paid with 5 $5 bills, which is 5 * 5 = $25. 

Now, we subtract the cost of roses from the amount she paid: 25 - 18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 6 dollars would be 6 * 4 = 24 quarters. 

For the remaining 0.25, we need 1 quarter.

So, Jenny leaves with 24 + 1 = 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and add them together.

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Terry makes $162 in total."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. 

To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

80"
"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = 2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = 2000 / 0.75
Original price = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. We can set up the equation:

Sale price = 1.2 * 2666.67
Sale price = 3200

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = 2666.67 - 3200
Discount = -533.33

Since we can't have a negative discount, we can find the percentage discount by taking the absolute value of the discount and dividing it by the original price, then multiplying by 100:

Percentage discount = (533.33 / 2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk to the store is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked back home, the total distance he covered is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store and walk back home.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which is 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract them from the total to find the number of MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. His weekly minutes are 1000, so the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is 1/16 * 1000 = 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. The total minutes he spends learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, the total hours he spends learning per week is 1062.5 / 60 = 17.75 hours.

The final answer is: 17.75"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'x', the amount they ate is x/2.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so x - x/2 = 270. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x/2 = 270. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 540.

So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, the initial amount must be 2 times 540, which is 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend can get sprayed with soda from this shaken can. 

The total number of sodas left is 1 (shaken) + 9 (unshaken) = 10.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 (shaken soda) / 10 (total sodas) = 0.1 or 10%.

The final answer is 10%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance covered by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distances covered by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00. She returned an item worth $15.00, so the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. The discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The discounted price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the items purchased is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00. Adding this to the new balance of $70.00, we get $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. We already know that the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

To find out how much she saves each year, we subtract her annual expenses from her annual income:
$100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take Lauren to save $1,000,000 for retirement. We can do this by dividing the target amount by her annual savings:
$1,000,000 / $60,000 = 16.67 years.

Since Lauren can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 17 years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches. 
Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total amount received: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, I assume it's a typo and the question is actually asking about Pierre and Paul. 

So, Pierre and Paul together have 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The amount left for Jacques is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

Initial temperature: 2 degrees Celsius
Increase in temperature: 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature + Increase in temperature

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But we know she had $2 left, so the $2 must be the amount she had after buying the books. This means she spent $10 - $2 = $8 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($8) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$8 ÷ 2 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

The total number of students enrolled this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times it blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 
So, the number of blinks per minute is 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. 
Time = Total blinks / Blinks per minute
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of each type of fish and the number of new fish Tate bought.

New male guppies: 2
New female guppies: 1
New male goldfishes: 2
New female goldfishes: 3

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of female fishes and male fishes:
Total female fishes: 8 + 8 = 16
Total male fishes: 6 + 5 = 11

The difference between the total number of female fishes and male fishes is: 16 - 11 = 5"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2. 

140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2.

280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

70 / 2 = 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10).

20 / 10 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris after using half of them. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight per box.

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

To convert the weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound).

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the amount Valerie's brother earns, we need to multiply Valerie's salary by 2. 

Valerie's brother earns: 2 * $5000 = $10,000

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, her salary is: 2 * $15,000 = $30,000

The total amount of money they all have together is: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Let's say it takes her x minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. Then, it takes her 2x minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach. We know that 2x = 40, so we can solve for x:

2x = 40
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Now, we know that it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach, and it takes her twice as long to walk on the sidewalk. So, it takes her 2 * 20 = 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can multiply the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk by 1:

40 minutes

Now, we can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk:

40 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 80 minutes

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny starts with 2 mugs of water. Since we don't know the temperature of the second mug, let's represent it as 'x'. 

The total amount of water Donny has after pouring is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug. 

So, the total amount of water Donny has is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

We know that the 33-degree mug contributed 4 ounces to the total amount of water. Let's calculate the temperature of the 33-degree mug in terms of the unknown temperature 'x'. 

The total amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the total amount of water is 5 ounces. So, the amount of water from the unknown temperature mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, and 4 ounces is from the 33-degree mug, the temperature of the unknown mug must be 5 ounces / 1 ounce = 5 times the temperature of the 33-degree mug.

The temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. So, the temperature of the unknown mug is 5 * 33 = 165 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 ÷ 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons in a year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks.

The total amount he earns from selling 60 rocks is 60 * 7 = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:
The amount of money he loses is the difference between the total cost and the total amount he earns: 500 - 420 = $80.

So, Adam loses $80.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, and Carlos collected 27 seashells, we can divide 27 by 2 to find out how many Carrey collected. 

27 / 2 = 13.5

Since we can't have half a seashell, we'll round down to 13 seashells for Carrey.

Now, we know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so we can find out how many seashells Jim collected by adding 5 to Carlos' total. 

27 + 5 = 32

Now that we know the total number of seashells each person collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells. 

13 + 27 + 32 = 72

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. 

72 / 3 = 24

So, each person got 24 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

The first song is 5 minutes long, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 x $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find Carl's cane length, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the difference between the total demand and the current production.

460 (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = 3740

However, this is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. To find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand, we need to divide the difference by the current production.

3740 / 4200 = 0.89

Since Hortex can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number.

0.89 ≈ 1

So, Hortex needs to produce approximately 1 more bottle to meet the total demand.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple. 

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing bows is 2 + (1/3 * 8) = 2 + 2.67 = 4.67 (round down to 4, since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The probability is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%."
"To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from this sale.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he earned $30 from this sale.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from this sale.

In total, Abraham earned $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by each person:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

To find the number of eggs still hidden, subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs:
36 (initial eggs) - 27 (eggs found) = 9 eggs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Now, we can substitute B in terms of Y into the equation for R: R = 4(Y - 7).

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting B and R in terms of Y, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 28 = 37.

Add 28 to both sides: 6Y = 65.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 65/6.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 65/6 - 7.

To simplify, convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 6: 7 = 42/6.

Now subtract: B = 65/6 - 42/6 = 23/6.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(23/6) = 92/6 = 92/6 * 1/1 = 92/6.

To simplify, divide both the numerator and denominator by 2: R = 46/3.

So, the length of the red rope is 46/3 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much money Rissa was given. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she was left with 4/5 of her original amount. 

Let's find out how much money Rissa had left: 
4/5 * 15 = 12

Now, we know that Rissa gave 15 - 12 = $3 to her sister.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars.

Ronnie was given $5, so she has 5 - 3 = $2 left.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since there are four colors in total, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We also know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

Now, we know that the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors. So, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 'x', which is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.2).

Number of pods in the new box = 100 * 1.2 = 120 pods

Now, we can divide the budget of $1 by the cost of one pod to find out how many cycles you can run.

Cost per pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12 = 8.33

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, you can run 8 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

2.25 = 0.20 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.25 / 0.20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Now, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood ten sharks have:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to find the number of bottles of cognac John bought. Since he bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he bought 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800. 

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400."
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'x'. 

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420 shells

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found. We subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first find the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total number of miles they need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, we divide the total number of miles by 4 to find the average. 8 / 4 = 2 miles.

So, the last dog needs 2 miles per day."
"To find out how much John has leftover after paying his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount: 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * 250,000 = $100,000
2. Calculate the amount used to pay off debts: 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * 100,000 = $60,000
3. Calculate the amount leftover: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72

Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
John's class capacity = 15 * 2 = 30
Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school = 30 * 2 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's class capacity + John's school capacity = 120 + 60 = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

To find the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at each station.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the total number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. 

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. 

3 full groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes
1 group with 2 students * 45 minutes per group = 45 minutes
Total time = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

So, Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

25% of 36 = 36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

Walter gave his sister 9 apples, so he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he buys 1 box per week, so the pasta cost per week is $1.00.
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. 
The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 per week * 52 weeks = $520.00.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the books fit. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total number of eggs, we need to multiply the number of dozens by 12 since there are 12 eggs in a dozen. 

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Rose bought 60 eggs for $2.40. 

Now, let's find out how much she will sell each egg for. 
She will sell 3 eggs for $1, so we divide $1 by 3 eggs to get the price per egg.
$1 / 3 eggs = $0.33 per egg

Now, we multiply the total number of eggs by the price per egg to find the total revenue.
60 eggs * $0.33 per egg = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue.
$20 (revenue) - $2.40 (cost) = $17.60

Rose's profit will be $17.60."
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 100 * 1/2 = 50 red hats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 50 * 3/5 = 30 blue hats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

35"
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played in a year by the number of points she scored in each game, and then multiply the result by the number of years.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of points scored per game: 21
Number of years: 4

Total points scored = 40 * 21 * 4
Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.

Now, Brendan has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Final answer: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls he needs to make to get 15 customers, we can divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

15 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 15 * 25 = 375 calls

However, we also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars, we can divide 15 by 1/2 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers).

15 cars / 1/2 car per 2 customers = 15 * 2 = 30 customers

Now, we know that Jason needs 30 customers to sell 15 cars. Since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls, we can divide 30 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

30 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 30 * 25 = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles and half have 5 medium candles. So, there are 4 small candles and 4 medium candles in each half of the rooms.

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 small candles per room, so that's 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 
For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 5 medium candles per room, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights.

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights: 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips Mitchell has. Since he bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply 2 by 55.

2 * 55 = 110

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
20 * 2 = x
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
40 = (1/2) * 20
40 = 10

So, there are 10 robots.

The total number of items Dominick saw is the sum of robots, helmets, and footballs:
10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the hours to minutes and then divide by the time it takes to deal with a call.

6 hours = 6 * 60 minutes = 360 minutes

Now, divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works for 5 days, multiply the number of calls per day by 5:
24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls

The final answer is 120."
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent on land and the time spent in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

The cost of the four additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in June and then multiply it by the price per doughnut.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June.

The price per doughnut is $2, so Derrick makes 3600 * 2 = $7200 in June.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw from the 4th day to the 7th day. Since he saw an average of 60 people each day, we multiply 60 by 4 (the number of days) to get 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped so far is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds.
   In 30 seconds, 80 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 80 + 80 = 160.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds.
   In 30 seconds, 40 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 160 + 40 = 200.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
   The total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The number of pink candies is 43."

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10 * 2 = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to first find the age of the older brother. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16. 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 
12 + 24 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 (since there are 28 days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric needed, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

We know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height. 

Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The discount on each T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. 
So, the price of each T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4. 
Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $4 = $8.

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16. 
So, the price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of each ticket: $14.25 ÷ $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. 
Total amount spent by Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses at $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each.
Total amount spent by Lani = $30 + $100 + $100 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani = $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the total cost of making one jar, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients. 

The cost of passion fruit for one jar is 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12.
The cost of jackfruit for one jar is 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12.
The cost of honey for one jar is 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20.
The total cost of making one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for each of the two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 
Total amount spent on movie tickets = 2 * $7.50 = $15
Total amount spent = $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Janet's parents gave her $40. 
Amount left = $40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie
Remaining:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

Now, Randy has a total of:
6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the 6 toy soldiers that would be sold for $5 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other 6 toy soldiers that would be sold for $7 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered is 29 - 24 = 5.

However, Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (which is twice as many as the first basket, so 10 * 2 = 20).

10 (eggs in the first basket) + 20 (eggs in the second basket) = 30

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = (x/2) * time

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = x * 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 4 / 16
x = 1/4 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's speed = x/2 = (1/4)/2 = 1/8 miles per minute

Time = distance / speed
Time = 4 / (1/8)
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate how much line he needs for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line.

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount he needs: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- 6 reservations per night * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals per night
- 12 meals per night * $5 per meal = $60 per night
- Adding the $5 bottle of wine per night, the total daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65 per night

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:
$65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour:

Ana peels: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
Jane peels: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320.
The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hired a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is 'x'. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.
