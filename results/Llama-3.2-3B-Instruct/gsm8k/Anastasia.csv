"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fibers: 2 bolts
White fibers: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so we need to calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh also put in $50,000 in repairs, so we need to subtract this from the new value to find the profit.

The profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens so far.

In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed to the chickens.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed to the chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed per day.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed per day - Total feed given so far
= 60 - 40
= 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost for the first 15 glasses (since the second glass is cheaper) and the 16th glass.

Cost for the first 15 glasses: 15 * $5 = $75
Cost for the 16th glass: $3

Total cost = $75 + $3 = $78

The final answer is: $78"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. This takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 40 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes + 40 minutes = 80 minutes.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Time spent in standstill traffic:
Time = 2 hours

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Time = 0.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Time spent driving at 80 mph:
Time = 4 - 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill traffic + 0.5 hours at 30 mph)
Time = 1.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances:
Total Distance = 180 + 15 + 120
Total Distance = 315 miles

John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (5 hours, since she worked 45 hours in total), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find out how much profit Carlos needs to make before he starts earning money.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, since we can't have a negative profit, we need to recalculate the break-even point.

Let's recalculate the net profit per year, considering the initial cost as a part of the expenses.

Initial cost: $90
Annual income: $10.50
Annual expenses: $3 + $90 (initial cost) = $93

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $93 (expenses) = -$82.50

Since the net profit is still negative, we need to recalculate the break-even point.

Let's try to find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

However, this calculation is incorrect, as it doesn't take into account the fact that the tree will produce lemons and generate income after the initial cost is covered.

Let's recalculate the break-even point:

Year 1: -$90 (loss)
Year 2: -$90 + $10.50 = -$79.50
Year 3: -$79.50 + $10.50 = -$69
Year 4: -$69 + $10.50 = -$58.50
Year 5: -$58.50 + $10.50 = -$48
Year 6: -$48 + $10.50 = -$37.50
Year 7: -$37.50 + $10.50 = -$27
Year 8: -$27 + $10.50 = -$16.50
Year 9: -$16.50 + $10.50 = -$6
Year 10: -$6 + $10.50 = $4.50
Year 11: $4.50 + $10.50 = $15
Year 12: $15 + $10.50 = $25.50

It takes 12 years for the tree to cover the initial cost, and in the 12th year, the net profit is $25.50. However, this is still not enough to cover the initial cost.

Year 13: $25.50 + $10.50 = $36
Year 14: $36 + $10.50 = $46.50
Year 15: $46.50 + $10.50 = $57
Year 16: $57 + $10.50 = $67.50
Year 17: $67.50 + $10.50 = $78
Year 18: $78 + $10.50 = $88.50
Year 19: $88.50 + $10.50 = $99

In the 19th year, the net profit is $99, which is greater than the initial cost of $90. Therefore, it takes 19 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So, Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential profit: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
Total value at the end of the month: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential profit: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
Total value at the end of the month: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the jewelry will have a higher total value at the end of the month ($5,125) compared to the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit. 

The profit from the jewelry would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000

Her annual salary from coaching: 
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching: 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the orange drink is 10 liters, and we spilled 1 liter, so the remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

The total amount of the remaining drinks is 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters.

Now, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. We already calculated that the total amount of water is 46/3 liters. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 46 by 3: 46 ÷ 3 = 15.33 liters.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know Raymond was 23 when his son was born. To find the age difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need: 
60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream is $16.00."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

The distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 15 miles.

So, the distance between the first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. We can do this by dividing the cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we can multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Since he spent $30 on video games, he must have had $30 initially. 

To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we need to divide the initial amount by the price of each Lego set. 

Initial amount = $30
Price of each Lego set = $15

Number of Lego sets = Initial amount / Price of each Lego set
= $30 / $15
= 2

So, John initially had 2 Lego sets."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Remaining pieces = 14

Pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings: 300g / 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48g.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, net profit = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

The net profit is -$160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

Total notes = 80 + 220 = 300

Since she had 23 notes remaining, we can find the number of notes in the package by subtracting the remaining notes from the total notes.

Notes in the package = Total notes - Remaining notes
= 300 - 23
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). 

200 / 40 = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so it's 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie. 

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * $40 = $60

Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

Total amount spent on ties = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of 15 floors. 

3/4 * 15 = 11.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a unit, we'll round down to 11 occupied units.

Now, we'll find the total number of units in the building: 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

The total number of unoccupied units is the difference between the total units and the occupied units:
120 - 11 = 109

"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- 6 truck tires at $60 each will be 6 * $60 = $360
- 4 car tires at $40 each will be 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- 12 car tires at $40 each will be 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday is $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days. 
$520 (Thursday) is greater than $480 (Friday), so Thursday had higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags she can fill:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, Marcy's annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts together: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount she paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:
10% of 140 = 0.1 * 140 = $14
Amount paid for the second half = 140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:
Total amount paid = 840 + 756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons) and then add the distance she has already traveled (100 miles).

First, let's calculate the remaining capacity of her tank: 
12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining capacity)

Now, let's calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank:
8 gallons (remaining capacity) * 25 miles per gallon (average miles per gallon) = 200 miles

However, since she has already traveled 100 miles, we need to add that to the total distance:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is a multiple of 2, we can buy 18 flowers in 9 packages of 2.
9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold by 11 (since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's).

Let's do the math:
Total copies sold = 88,000
Marilyn's copies = 10 * Harald's copies
10 * Harald's copies = 88,000
Harald's copies = 88,000 / 10
Harald's copies = 8,800

The answer is 8,800."
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests since 1/4 don't show up. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we first need to calculate the amount of potato salad each adult and child will eat.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half of that, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

Since there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Since there are 5 children, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 
Lee's time + 2 = Gerald's time

We know Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can plug that in: 
38 + 2 = Gerald's time
40 = Gerald's time

Now, we know Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time by dividing his original time by 1.1 (which is 100% + 10% improvement):
40 / 1.1 = 36.36 seconds

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used. 

16 / 3 = 5.33 (round down to 5 since you can't use a fraction of a tomato)

So, Freda used 5 cans of tomatoes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

Then, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 1 * 40 = 40 plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she already has: 80 - 40 = 40.

Mary will have 40 potted plants left."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 1 * 5 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water per day, so that's 2 glasses per weekend.

Now, let's add the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:
5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 7

So, John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours in total. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours of TV.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on these days: 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time spent watching TV on other days from the total: 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 hours to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday: 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours = 3 episodes.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."

For Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate:
90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, she would have taken on 2 liters * 3 sets = 6 liters of water.

The time it took her to row 64 feet is 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the time it took her to row 1 foot by dividing 16 seconds by 20 feet, which is 0.8 seconds per foot. Now, we can multiply this by 64 feet to get 64 * 0.8 = 51.2 seconds. However, we are given that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore, so the time it took her to row 64 feet is indeed 64 seconds.

The question asks how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore, which we've already determined to be 6 liters.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find the number of ducks in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
New selling price = $180 * 1.5 = $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio. 

The ratio is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar and water is 120, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part.

120 / 20 = 6

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to calculate 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago and subtract it from Adrien's salary. 

Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
30% of Adrien's salary four years ago = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago - 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40% from four years ago, we can calculate it as follows:
Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + 0.4 * $40,000
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's salary four years later = $56,000

Now, we can find Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% of her salary four years ago to her salary four years ago:
Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years later = $28,000 + 0.4 * $28,000
Lylah's salary four years later = $28,000 + $11,200
Lylah's salary four years later = $39,200

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of their salaries:
Total salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
Total salary four years later = $56,000 + $39,200

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. 

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (letters needing stamps) / 3 = 20 letters

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left is (x + 5) - 3.

We know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 12 spoons left. So, we can set up the equation:

(x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

Total revenue from patients: 500 people * $200/person = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $100,000 - $30,000
Profit = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 in profit from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   10 elves quit from the 40 remaining, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

There are 30 elves left.

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the luge.

Now, let's add up the total number of tickets used:
12 (Pam's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (Fred's roller coaster tickets) + 12 (luge tickets) = 48 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 48."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply by 12.

Number of car washes per month: 4

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can calculate:

Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, and there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can start by finding the number of queens. 

Let's assume the number of queens is Q. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. The sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. 
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total food cost and the total non-food cost plus the tax:

The total cost of bleach will be 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of cloths will be 3 * $5 = $15.

The total expenses will be $12 + $15 = $27.

Since Kim's total income is $92, his profit will be $92 - $27 = $65.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours (which is 30) fly from the hive and leave, which is 60 bees.
4. Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. We know 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees left before that hadn't returned.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. So, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she gave the cashier:

Total amount given - change = cost of tickets
Let's say the total amount given is x.
x - 8 = 22
x = 22 + 8
x = 30

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

We know that there were 5 fries left after the ants took one. So, before the ants took one, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon took some 'x'. Then, the raccoon took 2/3 * x fries. So, the remaining fries are 1/3 * x. We know that 1/3 * x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 18.

Now, before the raccoon took some fries, there were 18 + 2 = 20 fries.

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons ate, there were 20 + 9 = 29 fries.

The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull ate, there were 29 + 7 = 36 fries.

Dave ate 14 fries initially, so the pack had 36 + 14 = 50 fries when Dave bought it.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

The rolls are 4 inches long, and there are 300 of them. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12: 
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The chocolate croissants are 6 inches long, and there are 120 of them. We can convert the length of the croissants to feet by dividing by 12:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 6 feet

The baguettes are 2 feet long, and there are 60 of them. Since they are already in feet, we don't need to convert them:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 6 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 136 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 136 feet.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round
180 yards * 34 rounds = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of an action figure first. 

Since one red car costs $4 and one action figure costs $5, we can set up a proportion to find the cost of an action figure in terms of the cost of a red car. However, we are given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. 

Let's denote the cost of a red car as R, the cost of an action figure as A, and the cost of the doll as D. We know that:

1. R = $4
2. A = $5
3. D = 3A
4. D = R

From equation 3, we can express D in terms of A: D = 3A
From equation 4, we can express D in terms of R: D = R

Since D = 3A and D = R, we can set 3A = R. We already know that R = $4, so we can substitute it into the equation: 3A = $4

Now, we can solve for A: A = $4 / 3
A = $1.33

Now that we know the cost of an action figure, we can find the cost of the doll: D = 3A
D = 3 * $1.33
D = $4

Now that we know the cost of each toy, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = 5 red cars * $4 + 3 action figures * $1.33 + 1 doll * $4
Total cost = $20 + $4 + $4
Total cost = $28

Number of babysitting jobs = Total eggs required / Number of eggs per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age: S = 2B = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first find out how much money Ethel has, which is given as $8. 

Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we can calculate Jimmy's money as follows:

Twice Ethel's money = 2 * $8 = $16
Jimmy's money = $16 + $2 = $18

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures and add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs per spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs per insect = 540 legs
Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays each month, we need to add the minimum payments for all her debts and then multiply by 1.5 (since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum).

Minimum payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we multiply the total minimum payments by 1.5:
$1000 * 1.5 = $1500

To find the yearly amount, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply those times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds
Total time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes:
95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Converting 5700 seconds to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they sell each gallon for $10 and it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since they made $25 in profit, we can set up the equation: 
Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$10 * number of gallons - $5 * number of gallons = $25

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x'. 
$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = $25 / $5
x = 5 gallons

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can calculate the total cost of lemons:
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 5 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese team members. Since there are 240 team members in total, the number of Chinese team members is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members: 160 - 60 = 100.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation: 5x = 200. 

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 40. This means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

Since both probabilities are equal, the difference between them is 0%."
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide her mom's apples by 2, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The answer is 30."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find out how many rats there are: 90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages, we can divide the total number of rats by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.
Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue.

Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the cost of transportation:
Total cost = Total cost + Cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Since the trader made a profit of $400, we can set up the equation:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
$400 = $400 - $286
$400 = $114

This equation doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate our previous steps. 

Let's re-evaluate the number of bags:
Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
$400 = Number of bags * $30
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the cost of transportation:
Total cost = Total cost + Cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Since the trader made a profit of $400, we can set up the equation:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
$400 = $400 - $286
$400 = $114

This equation doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate our previous steps. 

Let's re-evaluate the number of bags:
Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag

Total cost = Total cost + Cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Since the trader made a profit of $400, we can set up the equation:

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour and then by the number of minutes in an hour.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. 
So, John collects peaches for 3 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 180 minutes.

Since John can collect 2 peaches per minute, he collects 2 peaches per minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

Total amount of insects per week = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the number of trees he planted and the number of trees he chopped down over the 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so over 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so over 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

So, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted them white and put them back out, so now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink plastic flamingos, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.

Since there are 6 white flamingos, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, since he edits an equal number for both publishers. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the average of the six tests, we need to first find the total score of the first five tests. 

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To get an average of 93, the total score of the six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.

Since the total score of the first five tests is 438, the score of the sixth test should be 558 - 438 = 120.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   The cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she can earn $60 in 12 babysitting sessions, she can afford the jacket and shoes in 12 sessions. However, she needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the same amount."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w = 42.

Now, we can substitute w = r + 2 into the equation 3r + 5w = 42. This gives us 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32.

Divide both sides by 8: r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time spent walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find out how many customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it now has 4x - 16 gallons.

We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can set up the equation:

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it now has 4x - 16 gallons.

We can set up the equation:

4x - 16 = 4(x + 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x - 16 = 4x + 64

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total amount she needs is the cost of the shoes and the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses in the vase. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias in the vase.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias together: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we have the ages of all three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find the average age in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

Average age in 3 years = (Harriet's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Adrian's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age in 3 years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in 3 years = 135 / 3
Average age in 3 years = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the four students: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat is $2.00.
Extra cheese is $1.00.
Avocado is $1.00.
2 sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The upgrade is $3.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: 
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to calculate their individual rates.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours.

"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide 42 by 3 to get the number of vines needed.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he writes 60 pages per week in 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is 14."

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class
= 30 students

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is:

15 + 12 = 27 girls

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

30 - 27 = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls, so the number of boys in these two classes is:

30 - 27 = 3 boys

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in the third class is:

3 boys / 2 classes = 1.5 boys

Since we can't have a fraction of a boy, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 1.5 boys could be 1 boy and 1.5 students who are not boys (but this is not possible since the school is 50% boys). Therefore, we can conclude that the third class has 1 boy."
"To find the total number of apps on Travis' tablet now, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the initial number of apps and then add the number of new apps he downloaded.

Initial number of apps: 61
Number of apps deleted: 9
Number of new apps downloaded: 18

Total number of apps now = Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted + Number of new apps downloaded
= 61 - 9 + 18
= 70

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to multiply his starting floor (3) by 4 and add 6.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 20 stalls. 
40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows per stall.

Now, we know that each stall originally had 20 cows and Mr. Sylas added 2 cows to each stall. 
20 cows (original) + 2 cows (added) = 22 cows per stall.

Since we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8. 
22 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows.

The answer is 176."
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she owes a flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount Nancy owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has:
44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has:
48 / 2 = 24 bananas

Now, let's add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits is:
52 + 24 = 76

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 66 / 12 = 5.5 cups.

The final answer is 5.5."
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to calculate 2/3 of 9,300.

2/3 * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 
Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. 
Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. 
Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 
So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has. 
11 - 3 = 8

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

There are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the total number of M&Ms: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we need to multiply that by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows.

12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines from each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines are Sean's, he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 15 + 30 = 45 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in each necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in both weeks:
Alani's stories: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's stories: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's stories: 60 + 120 = 180

Total number of stories: 60 + 120 + 180 = 360

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8 rows."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break down the information given:

Ali has 22 medals.
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

39 = 10x/11

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 11:

39 * 11 = 10x
429 = 10x

Now, divide both sides by 10:

x = 429 / 10
x = 42.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a medal, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the total number of medals given out must be a multiple of 11 (since 10 times less than a multiple of 11 equals 39). 

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 429."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * 5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add up the total count of activities for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last.

42 kg / 14 kg per week = 3 weeks.

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates he sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates he sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The initial bid was $200. Since the bids rose by $50 each time, the next three bids would be $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of the initial bid and the three bids: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To calculate the total miles driven per year, we need to calculate the miles driven per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a year.

Miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles (to and from work) = 60 miles
Miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving per year = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is:
$150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the bonus:
Total cost per year = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 * 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

Since the paper is folded in half, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to make a tabloid."
"To find out how much money is left, we need to subtract the money Annika spent from the total amount she had.

Annika started with $50.
She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides.
So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Now, we know that each book sells at 20$. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

Watson works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, he works 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in April.

His regular earnings for 20 days = 20 days * $10/hour = $200

Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a $300 bonus. 

Total earnings for April = Regular earnings + Bonus = $200 + $300 = $500

The final answer is: $500"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is the same as 0.8).

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses per week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

4 weeks"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person eats in a week and then add them up.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Cera was half as old as Noah, we can set up an equation: 
   Let's say Noah's age six years ago was x. 
   Since Cera was half as old as Noah six years ago, Cera's age six years ago was x/2. 
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, we can set up the equation: 
   x/2 + 6 = 46
   Solving for x, we get x = 40. 
   So, Noah's current age is 40 + 6 = 46.

2. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. 
   Since Noah's age six years ago was 40, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 40 = 120,000.

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the equation: 
   120,000 = (1/2) * current population
   Solving for the current population, we get: 
   current population = 120,000 * 2 = 240,000.

The final answer is: 240,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams should equal 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 
Now, the total number of marbles is 20 + 8 = 28.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.

3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

We know the total number of pencils is 26. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 + 46 = 26. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 48 = 26. 

Subtracting 48 from both sides, we get: 3x = -22. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = -22/3. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, this doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem. 

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. 

Let's try again. 

If Jam has 2 loose pencils, then the total number of pencils in the boxes must be 26 - 2 = 24. 

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the number of pencils in each box: 24/3 = 8. 

So, Jam has 3 boxes full of 8 pencils each and 2 loose pencils. 

Now, we can add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 8 * 3 + 2 + 46 = 26 + 48 = 74. 

Since the total number of pencils is 74, we need to find how many boxes are needed to store 74 pencils. 

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide 74 by 8 to find the number of boxes: 74/8 = 9.25. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Jam and Meg need 10 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since we don't know how many ice cubes were used, we'll assume that the coffee was cooled by 65 degrees using x ice cubes. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 
13x = 65

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 13:
x = 65 / 13
x = 5

So, the coffee was cooled by 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the coffee is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the cooling.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each trade involves 2 old records, we can divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

7 new records / 2 old records per new record = 3.5 old records

Since you can't trade half a record, we can round down to 3 old records per person. However, this would mean that 3 people would have 3 old records each, and 2 people would have 4 old records each. 

To find the total number of old records, we can multiply the number of people by the number of old records per person.

3 people * 3 old records = 9 old records
2 people * 4 old records = 8 old records
Total old records = 9 + 8 = 17 old records

The 5 people brought in 17 old records.

"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

At the second stop, 8 people got in. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 
20 (total people heading to the third stop) - 7 (people who got off at the second stop) = 13.

Since we already calculated that 13 people got on the bus at the terminal, we can confirm that the answer is indeed 13.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they got were 4 * 2 = 8 dollars off.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows.

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he had 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 balls initially. However, he dropped 3 balls, and 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 

7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel received 24 outfits from her friend.
At the baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

Now, let's add them together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87

Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby.

"To find the new distance Tyson runs each day, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new distance Tyson runs each day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

Total distance covered in June = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, we know Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

Tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Revenue from tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Revenue from silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

The difference in revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly cost of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100
Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: $6240"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Wednesday: 0.5 hours (half an hour)
Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the daisies and roses. 

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

In total, April needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the number of pots she needs from the total she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know John spent 50 hours on vacation. He spent 40% of this time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:

40% of 50 hours = 0.4 * 50
time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, so we need to add her earnings to her initial savings:
$275 + $80 = $355

Annabelle still needs to save:
$400 - $355 = $45

The final answer is 45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has left after spending on the activities she wants to do.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:
- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost of activities: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will get $5 for arcade tokens, we can divide the remaining budget by $5 to find out how many friends she can invite:
$60 / $5 = 12

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left. This means he had $2 initially, and he spent $2 on gumballs. So, he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs and $2 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is 0.05 days, which is equivalent to 1/20 of a day."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.

Total distance to his friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip to his friend's house, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

To find the time taken for the trip back home, we divide the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip: 2.86 + 3 = 5.86 hours

The trip took 5.86 hours."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. Minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out is 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before. 
We know Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 
So Sara had 4.67 points before. 
Since Erin scored 14 points, we add 14 to Sara's points to find Erin's points before: 4.67 + 14 = 18.67."

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, 40% of x is the number of faulty pieces. 

0.4x = number of faulty pieces

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, and this is the cost of all the pieces, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = x * cost per piece

We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / x

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for the number of faulty pieces:

0.4x = x * (400,000 / x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.4x = 400,000

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get:

x = 1,000,000

So, the total number of pieces is 1,000,000.

Now, we can find the number of faulty pieces:

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4x
= 0.4 * 1,000,000
= 400,000

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 1,000,000 - 400,000
= 600,000

The cost of functioning pieces is the total amount spent minus the cost of faulty pieces. We don't know the cost per piece, but we can find it by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of pieces:

cost per piece = 400,000 / 1,000,000
= 0.4

Now, we can find the cost of functioning pieces:

Cost of functioning pieces = number of functioning pieces * cost per piece
= 600,000 * 0.4
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

In this case, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since Millie sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 girls + 26 boys = 52 members.

Half of the people can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 52 / 2 = 26. 

The number of people who can't make it is 26. The number of people who can make it is 52 - 26 = 26.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people who can make it. 

The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

"To find out how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30.

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Now, let's divide the total ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

Let's divide 165 by 11: 
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Since the ratio is 5:6, we multiply 15 by 5 for Betty and 15 by 6 for Sam:
 
Betty has 15 * 5 = 75 popsicles
Sam has 15 * 6 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services without the discount:
- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu: $10 per month
- Disney Plus: $10 per month
Total cost without discount: $10 + $10 + $10 = $30 per month

Since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to calculate the discount amount:
- Discount amount: 20% of $30 = 0.20 * $30 = $6 per month

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the discount:
- Total cost with discount: $30 - $6 = $24 per month

To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
- Savings: $60 - $24 = $36 per month

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 1.5 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

The final answer is: 21.43"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more, we get 72 + 20 = 92 books.

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 cards.
Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she had 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.
In total, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
Now, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Then, she received 17 cards from family and friends.
So, she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12 and 1/4 of 12.

1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4)
1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3)

Jenny gives 4 slices to Bill and 3 slices to Mark, so in total, she gives away 7 slices.

Jenny had 12 slices initially and gave away 7 slices, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, it means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more money to cover the cost.

However, if we consider the scenario where Mark can save more money, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save:

$300 (bike cost) / $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

So, if Mark earns $10 per day, it would take him 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30

Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, let's add up the total number of bugs: 
90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal amount of flour by 4 since he's making a quadruple batch. 

3 cups of flour * 4 = 12 cups of flour

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total amount of flour needed by 2 to find out how many bags Mark needs to buy.

12 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the normal amount of milk by 4.

1 cup of milk * 4 = 4 cups of milk

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk needed by 2 to find out how many bottles Mark needs to buy.

4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

Now, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy. We subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. In 8 hours a day, it uses 8 * 900 = 7200 watts per day.

In 30 days, it will use 7200 * 30 = 216,000 watts.

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert 216,000 watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000.

216,000 / 1000 = 216 kilowatts.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage will be 3 hours (8 - 5 = 3).

The new daily energy usage will be 3 * 900 = 2700 watts.

In 30 days, the new daily energy usage will be 2700 * 30 = 81,000 watts.

The energy saved per day will be 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts.

In 30 days, the energy saved will be 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watts.

Converting this to kilowatts, we get 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.

The final answer is: 135"

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed, we first need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people watching the game, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total amount of money Tyson will spend, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns initially. After buying 60 more cannolis, he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

Since he bought 40 fewer corns, he now has 0 + 40 = 40 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 40 = 140.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
Total amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees. 
Total amount paid in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

Sally has $3 left."
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. To find the answer, we would need more information about the relationship between the two defects.

However, assuming that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as follows:

5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 x 50000 = 2500 candles

So, 2500 candles smell like wet dog. 

Since we assumed that these are the ones that also explode, the final answer is 2500."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20

= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 x $14

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

However, we know that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister does. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, Joanne must gather at least 1 apple from the average trees. 

So, 440 - 3x ≥ 1. 

Solving for x, we get 3x ≤ 439, x ≤ 146.33.

Since x must be a whole number, the maximum value of x is 146.

Now, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees: 440 - 3 * 146 = 440 - 438 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation based on the number of bumps:

2C + D = 304 (since each camel contributes 2 bumps and each dromedary contributes 1 bump)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and each animal has one head. So, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations:

2C + D = 304
C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first one:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything to this total.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total amount Cole saved. Since he saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. 

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). 

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
8 - 2 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60 birds.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90 birds.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the cost of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price. 

25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
The cost of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake: 
$5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards. He keeps 1/3 of them, which is x/3 cards. He sells 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2x/3 * 1.5 = x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150. Since he gets x dollars from selling the cards, we can set up the equation:

x = 150

However, this equation doesn't make sense because Kenny can't get $150 from selling 2/3 of his cards. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate that as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. Since the caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, that means he had enough hotdogs for 18 * 2 = 36 guests. 

Since 40 guests showed up, and the caterer had enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have two hotdogs, that means 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount:
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of $5 is $0.05. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars ($4.95) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents). 

First, we need to convert 75 cents to dollars, which is 0.75. Now, we can divide $4.95 by 0.75 to get the number of candy bars.

$4.95 / 0.75 = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 6 candy bars.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Rory and her mom each had 1 piece, so together they had 2 pieces. 

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Weight of the two pieces = 2 * 1 = 2 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, so the total number of people is 2 + 6 = 8.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges (34 + 22 = 56) by 8.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can plug these values into the formula:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the final temperature, let's break down the process step by step:

1. Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increases by 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.
   The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.
   The new temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

"To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 
Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 
James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find James' run time. We know James' swim time and bike time, so we can subtract them from his total time to find his run time. 
James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can multiply the distance by the cost of hay per mile:

Total cost of hay = Distance * Cost per mile
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * $3/mile
Total cost of hay = $48

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money he has:

Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $48
Change = -$18

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

Now, let's subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5

Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from these sales is 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. He sold these for $25 each, so the revenue from these sales is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket.

The cost of a super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost of a super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + P = $21

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

P = $6

So, the regular price of popcorn is $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
So, the original cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

The cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 
$65 * 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is 11050."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed. 

Volume = width * length * height
Volume = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the total volume by 10.

Total Volume = 32 * 10
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we divide the total volume by 2 to find the number of bags needed.

Number of bags = Total Volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

The total cost of the potting soil will be $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We also know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Since she keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students, she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply Gabriel's songs by 3. 
Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

To find out how many songs Gabriel can add, we subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity of his player. 
Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri has from the number of songs Gabriel can add. 
80 - 60 = 20

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10.

24 * 10 = 240

So, Stetson gave up $240.

240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

Final answer: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we need to divide the total miles run per week by the speed at which he runs (10 miles/hour).

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in each bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.
200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians. 

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:
Two thirds of 27 = (2/3) * 27 = 18

Now, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. 
One third of 18 = (1/3) * 18 = 6

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the temperatures:

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take for him to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors without the discount is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. So, the total cost will be $4.00.

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, we divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is 25."

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 x 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 x 64"" = 192"" (since the 60"" girl is not part of this layer) and then add the 60"" of the 10th girl, so 192"" + 60"" = 252"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 x 64"" = 128"".

Now, let's add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 252"" + 128"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

"To find the total minutes walked, we need to calculate the number of times Charisma gets up to walk in 5 days. Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, she will walk 24 times in 5 days.

Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, we multiply the number of times she walks (24) by the duration of each walk (5 minutes):

24 * 5 = 120 minutes

So, Charisma has walked for 120 minutes in 5 days.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood: 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 wood: 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 wood to save money.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks he can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 wood = $24 / $6 = 4

"To find the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and then July has 19 days until his birthday. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories over 211 days. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 211 days ≈ 16.6 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 16.6 calories per day to reach his goal."

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. This means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on the bus. So, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer. 
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we need to subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the monitors. 
$2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2. 
$600 / 2 = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 
300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Since George has 3 candies left after eating 5, we can find out how many candies he had initially by adding 5 to 3. 

George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies initially.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had by 2 to find out how many candies Nick had.

Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is 16."
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

To find out how many vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total vlogs needed:
72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

You and your wife will split the $60 evenly, so each of you will pay $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the amount he needs to save in the first half of the month. 

$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2.

$562.50 * 2 = $1125

However, this is the total amount he needs to save in the second half, and there are 15 days in the second half of April. To find out how much he needs to save each day, we can divide the total amount by 15.

$1125 / 15 = $75

So, Elvis needs to save $75 per day in the second half of the month.

$75"
"To find out how much Verna spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

The total cost of the items Verna bought is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:
5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 letters (from step 1) + 13 letters (from step 2) = 65 letters.

So, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families notified in each round and then add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:
3 (first round) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120

So, 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a hot and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. 
First, we find out how long it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day. 
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3 to find out how long it takes to swim 3 miles.
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day.

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the pyramid.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward at 5 degrees per hour, after 10 hours, the angle will increase by 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

So, the new angle of the sun relative to the pyramid will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

However, we need to find the angle from the ground to the sun. Since the pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the new angle of the sun relative to the pyramid.

The final angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 + 32 = 114 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
The second flower shop orders 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
The third flower shop orders 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops:
260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:

Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.
The cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by 7.

Let's calculate the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, let's divide the total number of birds by 7:
280 / 7 = 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

1. Diane gave a starting value of 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The resulting value (20 + 10) is 30.
4. 30 is divided by 5, which is 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The final value is the result of multiplying 6 by the starting value minus 12, which is 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to add 4% to the actual temperature to get the correct temperature. 

First, we find 4% of 520: 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

Now, we add 20.8 to 520: 
520 + 20.8 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equal to 90 minutes.
The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, let's add the lengths of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we'll calculate 10% of $100 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10
Discounted price = $100 - $10 = $90

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90 = $180.

Now, we need to find the cost of each pair of contacts. Since 90 single-use contacts come in 1 box and will last 45 days, we can divide the total number of contacts by 45 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 90 / 45 = 2

Now, we can divide the total cost by the number of pairs to find the cost of each pair.

Cost per pair = $180 / 2 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. 
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. 
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
His typing speed increases by 5 WPM, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM.
Then, his typing speed increases by 5 WPM again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.
To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of Jared's typing speed is 52 WPM.

Final answer: 52"
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of people invited by her friends, and the number of spouses.

Alex invited 100 people.
Each of the 100 people invited by Alex will also invite 2 friends, so the number of people invited by her friends is 100 * 2 = 200.
Alex also invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the number of additional people invited by her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, let's add up the total number of people attending the event:
100 (Alex) + 200 (her friends) + 10 (Alex's friends) + 18 (spouses) = 328

The total number of seats needed is 328.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than Mark's window height of 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven in a month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

Cost per pump = $0.20 / 60 washings = $0.00333 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: 
$0.00333 * 100 = 0.33 cents per pump.

"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 by 12:

28 * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 + 50% of $100,000, which is $150,000. 
The funding for the 7th month is $150,000 + 50% of $150,000, which is $225,000. 
The funding for the 8th month is $225,000 + 50% of $225,000, which is $337,500. 
The funding for the 9th month is $337,500 + 50% of $337,500, which is $506,250. 
The funding for the 10th month is $506,250 + 50% of $506,250, which is $753,750.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $753,750 = $2,277,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:

The cost of 20 fish is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.
The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to add the growth in each week.

The beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week.
It doubled in height the second week, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.
In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so the total height is 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of seats, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = Total seats - seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, so the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions.

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

4 + 4 = 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x $14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the total number of flowers in the garden, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 
10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:
200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

The number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. 
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, let's add the total number of cars towed on both periods:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's subtract his current height from the required height:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get the number of riders who can stay upright: 
100 * 0.25 = 25

Since 60% of these riders are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 to find the number of women who can stay upright: 
25 * 0.6 = 15

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5. 

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: 
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $1600
- Silver jewel: $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together. 

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
Total price = 4800

The final answer is: 4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add the number of each type of stamp together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $600.

Let's assume he misses x classes. The total cost will be:
$60 + $10 * (10 - x)

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to $600.

$60 + $10 * (10 - x) ≤ $600
$60 + $100 - $10x ≤ $600
$160 - $10x ≤ $600
-$10x ≤ $440
x ≥ -44

Since we can't have a negative number of classes, we can ignore the negative value. Therefore, Manny can miss 0 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

However, if we consider the context of the problem, it's more likely that the question is asking how many classes he can miss before they stop paying for the classes. In that case, the answer would be 0, as his parents will pay for all the classes.

Final answer: 0"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 100 + 50 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

The answer is 216."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary is his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.1 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

Since the final price paid on Tuesday ($398) is higher than the final price paid on the next day ($540), the difference is negative."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. Let's call the sales of green hats 'x'. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, the sales of red hats are x/2.

The total sales of the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats: x + x/2 = 3x/2.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * 3x/2 = 9x/8.

The total sales for two months is the sum of the sales of the first and second months: 3x/2 + 9x/8.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. So, we convert 3x/2 to 12x/8. 

Now we can add: 12x/8 + 9x/8 = 21x/8.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is 21x/8."

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of whole eggs.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

24 whole eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork.

We know that it took 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, the cooking time for beans is 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of other items) = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers. 

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they share equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

So, each person would have $120.

120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and 10 neutral days in the first 30 days. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in the month. 
12 (good days) + 8 (bad days) + 10 (neutral days) = 30 days

Since the first 30 days are already accounted for, the next 3 days are also part of the month. 
So, the total number of days in the month is 30 + 3 = 33 days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days in the month. 
Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. 
She had 3 more good days in the next 3 days. 
So, the total number of good days is 12 + 3 = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 good days left in the month."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x:

2x + 3 = 21
2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18
x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James bought toys for the 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. However, 3 dogs were gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs left.
6. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money was invested by each person, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left for Skyler's investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

So, Skyler's investment was 240 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up all the cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 
68 + 5 = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
73 - 12 = 61

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
73 + 23 = 96

Now that we know Summer has 96 cookies, we can add up all the cookies:
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The total number of cookies is 298."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending it by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are two sets of siblings: one twin and one triplet.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

Let's denote the age of the triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 37

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18.5

Since x represents the age of the triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5.

The final answer is 25.5."

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in 10 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 * 10 = 120 months in 10 years. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 10 years, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In 10 years, Neil saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have, we need to add the coins saved by Rong and Neil. 

Total coins = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount of gravel Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total.

So, 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount.

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. 

Let's assume the total water used by the city is 100%. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage used for non-industrial purposes is:

100% - 80% = 20%

So, the city uses 20% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of the croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of the cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of the mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, let's apply the 10% discount: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00
The total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops for free. 

So, she can buy 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free, which is a total of 4 scoops.

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how much candy each has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy eaten by each.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she will eat 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she will eat 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces each. After two weeks, Ginger will have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy will have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area he needs to cover by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store would be 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound = $75.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 compared to buying at the store."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the number of minutes.

When her arms are down, she taps at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. For 3 minutes, she taps at 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When her arms are up, she taps at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. For 2 minutes, she taps at 400 * 2 = 800 times.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of the buckets of asphalt plus the fine he would have to pay to the city council. 

3 buckets of asphalt cost 3 x $25 = $75
Adding the fine, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 + $120 = $195

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car.

$450 - $195 = $255

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Total normal chairs: 170
Total baby chairs: 23
Total chairs: 170 + 23 = 193

Chairs sent for repair: 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Chairs left: 193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12: (4/3) x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches: 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe in inches: 
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10 

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

The remaining people who had not voted by midday are:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted between midday and 16:00.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, multiply the number of kids by 2: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, multiply the number of adults by 1: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.

Now, add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, let's add their ages together: 
Dora's age + father's age + mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."

"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 days.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 60 * 20 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 days.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 100 * 8 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = chairs rented during weekdays + chairs rented during weekends
Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor:
2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the discount amount, multiply the marked price by the discount percentage (as a decimal). 

Discount = 5% of $140 = 0.05 * $140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price to get the final price.

Final price = Marked price - Discount
= $140 - $7
= $133

The final price you will pay is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists: 20
Number of songs in each playlist: 300
Length of each song: 10 hours

Total number of songs: 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours: 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we first need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win and how many people think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find out how many people are remaining after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - people who think horse #2 will win - people who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up an equation to find the total number of puppies:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Jayden already had $70, so now he has:
$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total, we can calculate it as follows:
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = 1/2 * 250 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * 125 = 250

So, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The three of them spent $14 to make a salad for the potluck."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to 200.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears: 200 + 290 = 490.

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 
$80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges he needs for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, the total cost will be 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the total number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed.

Ezra read 300 books initially and then decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide 450 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

Now, we add the total number of books Ezra read (450) and the total number of books Ahmed read (225) to find the total number of books they read altogether: 450 + 225 = 675.

The final answer is: 675"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
Plus, she earns an additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
Plus, she earns an additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so:
$30 + $5 = $35

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 (Monday) + $35 (Wednesday) = $100

Tanya earned $100 for these two days of teaching.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.
The total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x $3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: $135 - $60 = $75.

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn: $75 ÷ 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   So, he had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   So, he had 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total number of wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels available in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

There will be 276 wheels left."
"To find the discount amount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% = 0.20).

You have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= (400 - 160) * 10
= 240 * 10
= $2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we need to find half of their driving speed. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply their hiking speed by the time they hiked: 

20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

So, the distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy points will be x + 8 * 10 = x + 80.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma's berry points will be (x + 3) * 5 = 5x + 15.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so her time is x - 4. Ava's time is x + 4.

Emma's total score is 5x + 15 + (x - 4) * 30 = 5x + 15 + 30x - 120 = 35x - 105.

Since Ava's score is x + 80 + (x + 3) * 5 + (x + 4) * 30 = x + 80 + 5x + 15 + 30x + 120 = 36x + 215.

The difference between their scores is 36x + 215 - (35x - 105) = x + 320.

However, we don't know the value of x. To find the difference, we need more information about their scores."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For two days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's assume that x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W. Since he had 4 white fish initially, the number of white fish he has now is W = 4 + (17 - x).

We know that the number of orange fish he has now is 3 - x. Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2W
3 - x = 2(4 + 17 - x)
3 - x = 2(21 - x)
3 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 39

Now that we know x, we can find the number of white fish taken out: 17 - x = 17 - 39 = -22. However, we can't have a negative number of fish, so we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some white fish. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 + (17 - x))
3 - x = 2(21 - x)
3 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 39

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

She spent 6 twenties, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 twenties left.

Carrie had 140 quarters. She spent all of them, so she has 0 quarters left.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent. 
She spent 6 twenties, which is 6 * 20 = 120 dollars.
She also spent 140 quarters, which is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

The total amount of money she spent is 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

The final answer is: 155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the night and the freezing point is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10 groups.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The final answer is 12."

"To find the total number of lions, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in the first month: 200 employees * $4000 = $800,000
Total amount paid in the second month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in the third month: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000

Total amount paid in three months: $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, we can set up an equation to find the number of goats she needs:

Let x be the number of goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We want 30% of this total to be goats, so we can set up the equation:

0.3(14 + x) = x

To solve for x, we can start by distributing 0.3 to both terms inside the parentheses:

4.2 + 0.3x = x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides to get:

4.2 = 0.7x

Next, we can divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for x:

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them. 

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per square inch and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower: 
- 3 - 1 = 2

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Total S'mores they can make = 17
Number of kids = 2

S'mores per kid = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

John can have 8 S'mores.
DeSean can have 8 S'mores.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he played 240 / 20 = 12 games.

One of his friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, they played 240 / 10 = 24 games.

The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, they played 240 / 30 = 8 games.

The total number of games played is 12 (Jack) + 24 (first friend) + 8 (second friend) = 44 games.

The cost per game is 1 quarter, which is $0.25. So the total cost is 44 * $0.25 = $11.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + S = 10
6S = 10
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Since S = G, G = 5/3.
Since Z = F, F = Z = 5/3.

Now, we know that O = 2S, so O = 2 * (5/3) = 10/3.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students, we divide the amount from students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

The final answer is 6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate it as follows:
Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time she walked on both days:
Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time in minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we know she scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Then, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is 0.35 dollars per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost is 0.35 * 4 = 1.40 dollars.

The book is 20 miles away, and the shipping cost is 0.08 dollars per mile, so the shipping cost is 0.08 * 20 = 1.60 dollars.

The total shipping cost is 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 dollars.

The book cost 32 dollars, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund will be 0.75 * 32 = 24 dollars.

To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund from the original cost of the book: 32 - 24 = 8 dollars.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan started with $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, it means she is in debt."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends on each activity: 72 videos (recording) + 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

The final answer is: 86"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. 
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items. 
The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and finally how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). So, Naruto can lift 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total time by the number of turtles.

Time taken by four turtles = Total time / Number of turtles
Time taken by four turtles = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time taken by four turtles = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find out how many clay dishes they all make together, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person made.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she gets a $200 discount, the price will be $600 - $200 = $400.

She already has some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call it x.

She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she has now is x + $150 + $80 = x + $230.

Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up the equation: x + $230 = $400.

To solve for x, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation: x = $400 - $230.
x = $170.

So, Erika has $170 in her purse."

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces per day (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows needed.

5 cows - 3 cows = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and then add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length: (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length: (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length: (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

To find the total number of dishes, we know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, my sister's age as S, and my mom's age as M.

From statement 1, we can write: A = B - 3
From statement 2, we can write: A = S + 2

From statement 3, we can write: M = 3B - 1

Combine like terms: 5B - 2 = 87

Add 2 to both sides: 5B = 89

Divide by 5: B = 17.8

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary because we can find the correct answer using the rounded value.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs: 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. 
On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.
Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.
Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 
Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 2 x 3 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer had 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. In a year, Amber earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Then, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20. So, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52

75 (total) - 52 = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. 

Let's say Fawn has x books. 
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation: 
x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms: 
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know that the carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the total amount Keenan pays by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours, so her hourly rate is $33 / 3 = $11 per hour.

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can divide the runtime of the concert without the encore by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts. 

50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys: 200
Toys given away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Number of toys Argo has now: 200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so that's 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be paired. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means 80% of the microphones can be paired. 

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8. 

50 * 0.8 = 40

So, the singer can arrange 40 microphones in pairs. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead: 
2/3 of 6 birds = (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds

Next, let's find the total number of birds in the groups: 
3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, let's add the birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the groups together: 
6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in the groups) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = 55 - 5 = 50

Since she placed the rest equally into five jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5 = 10

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100 plants. 
One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants.
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants.
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig speed = 5x
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We can subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

$11 (total) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2.

$2 / 2 = $1

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 13 * 6 = 78
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * 13 * 6 = 234
- Alba's lawn: 5 * 13 * 6 = 390

Total amount from mowing lawns: 78 + 234 + 390 = 702

Now, let's subtract the total amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $702 = -$622

However, this is not possible since she made a positive amount. This means our initial assumption that she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, and Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, we can set up the equation:

3x = 5x - x
3x = 4x
x = 0

This means she didn't mow Joe's lawn at all. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 0 times. And since she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 0 times.

The only remaining option is that she mowed Joe's lawn once, and the rest of the money came from lemonade sales.

Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she earned 6 dollars from mowing lawns. The remaining amount is $80 - $6 = $74.

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car:
10 rentals per month * 3 hours per rental * $25 per hour = 10 * 3 * 25 = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
$750 - $500 = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 per month.

250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 
3x = 7, where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3, which is approximately 2.33. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks for Joseph.

Now, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2 notebooks. 
7 - 2 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 + 1/5, which is 6/5. 

Anis' distance = 50 * (6/5) = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance by adding Dijana's and Anis' distances.

Total distance = 50 + 60 = 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 
Daniel didn't read any pages today.

Now, let's compare the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. 
Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages. 
Daniel read 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read. 
28 - 13 = 15

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that Calvin and his wife will eat for dinner. Since they are adults, they will eat 2 bowls. 

So, 4 bowls - 2 bowls = 2 bowls of soup left for the children.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining 2 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

2 bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl per child.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50

The total amount William spent is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets per movie = 27 tickets

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 

7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used blue shoe boxes) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes and subtract that from the total number of red shoe boxes.

1/3 of 9 (total red shoe boxes) is 3. 
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (used red shoe boxes) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from 18. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write an equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write another equation:

D = 60

Now we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A - 8 + 8
60 = 2A

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:

60/2 = 2A/2
30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we need to add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we need to add the size of both farms together. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 * 20 (bologna at red balloons) + 3 * x (bologna at yellow balloons) = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3x = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven (3000) by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5 for 2, the cost of 12 balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) = $14.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $14 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. 

$28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide 24 berries by 2 trips to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies he can see. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days.

= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

First, let's add up the number of toys Sophie already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys already had: 48
Bouncy balls in the tube: 62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

Now, we can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 more balloons.

Now, we add the initial balloons to the additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

The total number of balloons is 25.

25"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables.

15"
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets
Total money from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in earnings:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would pay, we first need to calculate the number of hours he stays at the hotel. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. So, he stays for 18 hours.

Since he chooses the 12-hour option for the first 12 hours, he pays 1000 pesos. 

For the remaining 6 hours, he adds 70 pesos for each hour. So, he pays 6 * 70 = 420 pesos.

The total amount Cameron pays is 1000 + 420 = 1420 pesos.

To find out how much he would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option. The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos.

Cameron saves 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos.

The final answer is 180."
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left, we need to calculate his earnings, subtract the expenses, and then determine how much he can spend on pens.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide 100 by 25, which is 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40

Cost of parts = $60

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110."
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She started with 15 stickers.
2. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. 
Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points. 
Bahati scored (x + 10) + 20 points, which is x + 30.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms: 
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 5/3

Since x represents Dinar's points, Dinar scored 5/3 points. However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to 1 point for Dinar.

Now, we know that Azibo scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Azibo scored 1 + 10 = 11 points.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.
900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.
60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep from 2:15 to 2:38 am. 
2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, we need to add those 5 minutes to the total time. 
23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes

However, we also need to consider the time she usually sleeps. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We need to convert 8 hours into minutes. 
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time she was awake (28 minutes) from the total time she usually sleeps (480 minutes). 
480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan also has 24 measuring cups. So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils.

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, initially, there are 100 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
100 + (50 * 14) = 100 + 700 = 800 beds

Now, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 800 = 200 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to her family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the remainder is 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13

We also know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so:
X + S + A = 339

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
5A - 8 = 339

Add 8 to both sides:
5A = 347

Divide both sides by 5:
A = 69.4

Since the number of Pokémon caught must be a whole number, we'll round down to 69 (as you can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now, substitute A = 69 into the second equation:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(69) - 13
S = 276 - 13
S = 263

So, Stan has caught 263 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 263"

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up back at her southern home, we need to subtract the total distance traveled from the initial distance between the two homes. Since the bird traveled a total of 446 miles, we can assume that the distance between the two homes is also 446 miles.

The final answer is: 446"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at her office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies made and received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), Nani's brother (16), and Nani's sister (6).

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total number of players.

Total number of players = 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box. 

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she had initially. 

12 - 4 = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges. 

240 - 60 - 80 = 100 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much Tyler needs to earn, we need to add up the cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 
$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

Now that we know Jerry has 40 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since we can't have a negative number of cherries, we can say that Robert has 10 fewer cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside.

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

The price of the blue car is $100.
The price of the red car is $60.

The final answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to convert this to inches as well: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space each plant occupies: 12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between) = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant occupies: 1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4.

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 flowers * $6/flower = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, we multiply the daily pretzel consumption by 7 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

9 pretzels * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

The total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling time is also 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. 

So, the total time to peel and cook 30 shrimp is 10 minutes. 

To find the time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 10 minutes by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 degrees.

So, the net cooling effect is 6 - 12 + 2 = -4 degrees.

The final temperature is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 * 30 = x + 75 (since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years)

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent: $30 - $18 = $12.

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount Walter has collected.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount Walter has collected so far.

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we can assume that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount Walter has collected so far. 

So, Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the amount Walter has collected so far, which is $2000. 

$2000 * 3 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices. 

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

We know that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's assume the kid's slice is x. Then, the adult's slice is 2x.

Since there are 4 kids, the total area of their slices is 4x. The total area of the adult's slices is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total area of the watermelon is the sum of the areas of the slices, which is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the area of the adult's slice by the total area of the watermelon and multiplying by 100:

(4x / 8x) * 100 = 50%

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
So, to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the monthly cost, which is $480 - $480 = $0.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $0."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract Martha's number from Peter's number: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61916 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61916 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6191.60

"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the number of hours they traveled.

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. 

450 - 220 = 230

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of her friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

3. 15 guests checked out late, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

"To find out how many points Anastasia is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she can answer correctly.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, in total, Anastasia is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total amount earned from large stuffed animals. Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is y. Then, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12y.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y.

The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2y * 4 = 8y.

We know that the total amount earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine like terms:

20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

y = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

Number of small stuffed animals = 2y = 2 * 6 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 
So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to get the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found, so the number of eggs that were found is 100 - 10 = 90.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found from the total number of eggs that were found: 90 - 60 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then multiply it by 4.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   25 red balloons * 40% = 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the remaining red balloons:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:
   12 yellow balloons * 0.5 = 6 yellow balloons were released.

4. Calculate the remaining yellow balloons:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to calculate the probability of the opposite event (not having to turn in homework) and subtract it from 100%.

The probability of not having a substitute teacher is 100% - 50% = 50%.
The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%.
The probability of Marcus not convincing the teacher is 100% - 20% = 80%.

Now, we multiply these probabilities together to find the probability of all these events happening: 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%.

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 24% = 76%.

The final answer is: 76."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 
150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

Melissa's total earnings for 3 days: $90 per day * 3 days = $270
Melissa's parking expenses for 3 days: $3 per day * 3 days = $9
Melissa's total expenses: $270 - $9 = $261
Melissa's hourly earnings after expenses: $261 / 18 hours (6 hours per day * 3 days) = $14.50 per hour

The final answer is: $14.50"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to make each move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 
2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 
80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Anastasia will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Anastasia starts with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year, so the total amount of money he lost is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
He had a $25,000 a year job before college, and his college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years, the total amount of money he earned is:
$75,000 * 4 = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school:
$200,000 (lost money) + $50,000 (loans) = $250,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$250,000 / $75,000 = 3.33 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 3.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we multiply the length and width to find the area:
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

80"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * 2 - $5 = $4 - $5 = -$1.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * -1 = $-1.5.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost: $5 + $1.5 + $1.5 = $8.

To find the average, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $8 / 3 = $2.67.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $2.67."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America: 26
Number of cities in each country: 5
Population of each city: 1000

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population in South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, let's find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
= 52 inches - 51 inches
= 1 inch

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours the painters worked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we can calculate the hours worked in a day as follows:

1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of 24 hours = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we need to multiply the hours worked in a day by the number of days:

3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days
Total hours worked = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

Total hours worked / number of painters = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,618.82
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,618.82 = $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,863.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the number of books written in English and German.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile:

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72.

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

$192 x 12 = $2304.

James pays $2304 a year."
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 
Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's total by 2 to find Silvia's total. 
Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by all three: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

James gets 80 emails a day, and 20% of those don't require a response. 
20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

So, the number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails."

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter required for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter required by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00 and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

The total cost will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is 25 + 7 = 32. She also invited 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

So, the total number of guests is 32 + 13 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is $125 (for the initial 20 guests) + $126 (for the additional guests) = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to calculate the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 of $60 is $15.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 of $60 is $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$120 - $35 = $85.

So, Maggie and Riza have $85 left.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (since 15 is 1.25 times a dozen) = $18.75.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she will need to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75 in total.

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so $13.75 is equal to 13.75 * 4 = 55 quarters.

The answer is 55."

"To determine how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes after the initial time.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, to find out how long Paul will wait, we need to subtract the initial time from the time he boards his train. Since the initial time is not given, we can assume it is 0 minutes. 

Paul will wait for 145 minutes."
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = $2000 * 1.20
Selling price = $2400

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $2400
Discount = $266.67

Now, we can calculate the percentage discount:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = ($266.67 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk to the store is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked back home, the total distance he covered is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store and walk back home.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which is 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract them from the total to find the number of MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is 17.6875."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Since the velociraptors ate half of it, they ate x/2 kilograms. 

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms. 

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 270 + 540 = 810 kilograms.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend can get sprayed with soda from this shaken can. 

The total number of sodas left is 1 (shaken) + 9 (unshaken) = 10.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 (shaken soda) / 10 (total sodas) = 0.1 or 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age can be calculated as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of returned item: $15.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $58.00

Initial charge: $85.00
Refund for returned item: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
New total cost: $58.00
New balance: $70.00 + $58.00 = $128.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. These 6 jellyfish are the large jellyfish that change color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

To find out how much she saves each year, we subtract her annual expenses from her annual income:
$100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take Lauren to save $1,000,000 for retirement. We can do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save ($1,000,000) by her annual savings ($60,000).

$1,000,000 / $60,000 = 16.67 years.

Since Lauren can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 17 years to save enough for her retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, there are 600 students in the school.

The number of girls in the school is the total number of students minus the number of boys:

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches. 
Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10).

20 / 10 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is 46."
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age 2 years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons since they are the same weight, so the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

Total weight of crayons and boxes = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 + 12.5
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Let's say it takes her x minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. Then, it takes her 2x minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach. We know that 2x = 40, so x = 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Now, we know that it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach, and it takes her twice as long to walk on the sidewalk. So, it takes her 2 * 20 = 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 40 minutes. Since she walks 2 miles on the sidewalk, it takes her 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.

Now, we can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk. 40 + 80 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has in the bottle after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring, the total amount of water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the unknown temperature mug contains x ounces of water. 

Donny poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, so the total amount of water in the bottle is 4 + x + 1 = x + 5 ounces.

Since the total amount of water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the inequality:

x + 5 ≥ 40

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

x ≥ 35

Since x represents the temperature of the water in the unknown mug, it must be at least 35 degrees.

The final answer is 35."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 9 bagels in each pack. So, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

The total cost of the bagels is 36 bagels * $10.00/bagel = $360.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $360.00 = 0.1 * $360.00 = $36.00.

The total cost after the discount is $360.00 - $36.00 = $324.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = Total cost / Total number of bagels = $324.00 / 36 bagels = $9.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 100 rocks, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks.

The total amount he earns from selling 60 rocks is 60 * 7 = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:
The amount of money he loses is the difference between the total cost and the total amount he earns: 500 - 420 = $80.

"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Since Carlos collected 5 more seashells than Jim, and Jim collected 27 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by adding 5 to Jim's total. 
Carlos collected 27 + 5 = 32 seashells.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide Carlos' total by 2. 
Carrey collected 32 / 2 = 16 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells. 
Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 32 (Carlos) + 16 (Carrey) = 75 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. 
Seashells per person = 75 / 3 = 25.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the difference between the total demand and the current production.

460 (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = 3740

However, this is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. To find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand, we need to divide the total demand by the current production.

3740 / 4200 = 0.89

Since Hortex can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number.

0.89 ≈ 1

So, Hortex needs to produce approximately 1 more bottle to meet the total demand.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple. 

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows, and there are 8 babies in total, 2 + (1/3 * 8) = 2 + 2.67 = 4.67 (round down to 4, since we can't have a fraction of a baby) babies wearing bows.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100. 

So, (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 x $3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

To find the number of eggs still hidden, subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs:
36 (total eggs) - 27 (eggs found) = 9 eggs

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) apartments. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments. 

John collects garbage from 3 complexes, 3 times a week. 

He collects garbage from 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments per week. 

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1040 * 0.40 = $416 per week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100, which is $20.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Since the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, we can write the equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she gave 15 / 2 = $7.5 to her sister.

Now, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which is 15 - 7.5 = $7.5.

Since the question asks for Ronnie's money, we don't need to do anything else. Ronnie's money remains the same, which is $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + x = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, the amount of each color (red, white, and purple) is 3 pints. Since we want to find the amount of red paint used, the answer is:

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds counted each day: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds counted by Alice at the end of the week is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

100 + (100 * 0.2) = 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box contains 120 pods. We also know that you can run 1 cycle per pod. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total cost of the new box ($12) by the cost per pod (which is $12/120 pods = $0.1 per pod).

$12 / $0.1 per pod = 120 cycles

So, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

2.25 = 0.20 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.25 / 0.20
x = 11.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The teacher will have 11 days before he has to recycle the chalk."

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

James drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, then multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the total cost of these gallons.

Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of returned milk = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
6 cheese pizza slices + 4 pepperoni pizza slices = 10 slices per friend.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 slices per friend * 6 friends = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, we need to divide 60 slices by 12 slices per pizza to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs: 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 cheese pizzas.

Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide 60 slices by 8 slices per pizza to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs: 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas.

Since we can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas.

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 5 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 13 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

1. Calculate the loan amount: 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * 250,000 = $100,000
2. Calculate the amount used to pay off debts: 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * 100,000 = $60,000
3. Calculate the amount leftover: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to first find out how many balloons they started with. Since they have 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, we multiply 10 packs by 30 balloons per pack.

10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

Since they have 12 balloons left, we subtract 12 from the total number of balloons they started with to find out how many they threw.

300 - 12 = 288

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to first find the amount of each medicine in one dose.

For the first medicine, Saanvi uses 14 mL.
For the second medicine, she uses 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, she uses 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
John's class capacity = 15 * 2 = 30
Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school = 30 * 2 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's class capacity + John's school capacity = 120 + 60 = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he will pay in 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

So, in the twelfth month, Stephen will pay $306.

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 x 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will change the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we need to divide the total number of diapers by 2. 

10 / 2 = 5

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

The final answer is: 765"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at each station.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the total number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. So, the total number of visits is 3 * 5 = 15.

The cost of one visit is $2. So, the total cost for the initial 5 years is 15 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $6.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. So, the total number of visits is 3 * 3 = 9.

The total cost for the next 3 years is 9 * 6 = $54.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is 30 + 54 = $84.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

Total number of students = 10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

Time taken by 3 full groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes
Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 45 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken by 3 full groups + Time taken by 1 group with 2 students = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, Carly made a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

So, Eve gave away 5 pomelos."
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

So, Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

25% of 36 = 36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is 81."

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he buys 1 box per week, so the pasta cost per week is $1.00.

The cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. So, the total cheese cost per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls it takes to get 1 customer, we divide 25 by 1. This gives us 25 calls per customer.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars, we divide 15 by 1. This gives us 15 customers.

Now, we know that it takes 25 calls to get 1 customer, and we need 15 customers to sell 15 cars. To find out how many calls Jason needs to make, we multiply the number of customers needed by the number of calls per customer. This gives us 15 * 25 = 375 calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 375 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each half of the rooms.

There are 8 rooms in total, so half of the rooms would be 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 small candles per room, so 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 
For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 5 medium candles per room, so 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per room, so for 8 rooms, there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights.

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights. 
Total candles = 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles
Total flashlights = 16

So, Brianna's family is using 36 candles and 16 flashlights when the lights go out.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
20 * 2 = x
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
40 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
40 * 2 = y
y = 80

Now that we know there are 80 robots, 40 footballs, and 20 helmets, we can find the total number of items:
Total items = 80 + 40 + 20
Total items = 140

The total number of items Dominick saw is 140."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week.

Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes he spends on calls per day:

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, we can multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we need to divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent hopping = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent hopping = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent hopping = 5 minutes

Time spent swimming = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent swimming = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent swimming = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent hopping + Time spent swimming
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

60"
"To find out how much Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in June. Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

10 dozen doughnuts = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day

Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June.

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so Derrick makes 3600 * 2 = $7200 in June.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first calculate his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we can divide the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The answer is 12."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw for the rest of the week. There are 5 days left (Monday to Friday). 
Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, the total number of people for the remaining 5 days is 5 * 60 = 300 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 300 (remaining days) = 560 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 560."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped so far is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 80 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 80 + 80 = 160.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   In 30 seconds, 40 kernels pop. 
   The total number of kernels popped so far is 160 + 40 = 200.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10. 
   So, 10 more kernels pop from the residual heat. 
   The total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as the other gallons:
2 * 1 cup = 2 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are required for 2 cups:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, let's multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Total number of legs = 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Now, to find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
Total pairs of legs = 80 / 2 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.

The tower has 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Total number of blue and yellow blocks
= 32 - 12
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The number of pink candies is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights:

To find the cost of the bus trips, we need to calculate 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel:
10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips:
$8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost:
$240 + $56 = $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Darla received, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping 4, he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."

Anastasia will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours. 

Then, we add 2 hours to that result, which is 5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga per week is 5 * 7 = 35 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 30 minutes (meditation) + 35 hours (yoga) = 35.5 hours.

"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."

- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for each movie ticket, and $8.50 on a bracelet. Since she bought tickets for herself and her sister, she spent 2 x $7.50 = $15 on movie tickets.

Total amount spent = $3.50 (ice cream) + $15 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given:

$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left.

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

Now, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies

Now, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Now, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 oatmeal cookies + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, he has:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the 6 toy soldiers that would be sold for $5 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other 6 toy soldiers that would be sold for $7 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

The final answer is 4."
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School.

3/4 of 4000 is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000.

The difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School is 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, let's solve for B: 8 + B + 16 = 29
B + 24 = 29
B = 5

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (7 - 5 = 2)."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs.
The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

So, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = (x/2) * time

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = x * 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 4 / 16
x = 1/4 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's speed = x/2 = (1/4) / 2 = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can find her time:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (1/8)
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total amount needed.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- 6 reservations per night * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals per night
- 12 meals per night * $5 per meal = $60 per night
- $60 per night + $5 per night (wine) = $65 per night

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue would be:
$65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour:

Ana peels: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
Jane peels: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320.
The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hired a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 x $50 = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4): 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
