"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fibers: 2 bolts
White fibers: Half of 2 bolts is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

3 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/week

James runs 180 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she has already given to her chickens.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total cups of feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken, we need to divide the total cups of feed given so far by 3 to find out how many cups of feed each chicken has received.

40 cups / 3 = 13.33 cups per chicken

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we need to multiply the cups of feed each chicken has received by the number of chickens.

13.33 cups per chicken * 20 chickens = 266.6 cups

Since Wendi can't give a fraction of a cup of feed, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, Wendi needs 266 cups of feed for the final meal of the day."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The first glass costs $5.
The remaining 15 glasses cost 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3 per glass.
The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * 3 = $45.
The total cost of all 16 glasses is 5 + 45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sheep Charleston has, then how many sheep Toulouse has, and finally add them together with Seattle's sheep.

Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the sheep together: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute. Since the file is 200 GB, it will take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the entire file.

However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart. 40% of 100 minutes is 40 minutes. So, Carla downloads for 40 minutes, then the computer restarts.

After the restart, Carla has to download the first 40 GB again. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it will take her 40 / 2 = 20 minutes to download the first 40 GB.

Now, she has to download the remaining 160 GB (200 - 40). It will take her 160 / 2 = 80 minutes to download the remaining 160 GB.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (first download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 80 minutes (second download) = 140 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down the journey into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, we add up the distances: 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

So, John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Final answer: 315"
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours of overtime.
Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.
Her overtime earnings would be:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the downloads were three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the profit per year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90.
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons and can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual income is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.
The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The annual profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, we need to divide the cost to plant the tree ($90) by the annual profit ($7.5) to find out how many years it will take to break even.

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to break even. After that, he will start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has 2/3x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (2/3x - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3x - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

2/3x - 2 = 10

Now, we can add 2 to both sides:

2/3x = 12

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 36

Finally, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

So Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine which option is better, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial price: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial price: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value - Initial price
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, we can say that each train traveled 80 miles westward.

For the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train traveled 150 miles northward.

Now, let's add the distances they traveled in the two days:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, each train covered a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week as a teacher. 
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Jill earns $30 per hour as a coach. She works 15 hours a week as a coach. 
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total weekly earnings.
$700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply her weekly earnings by 50 to find her annual salary.
$1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4 to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we need to find the total time she needs to spend to cover the entire 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to reach her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed needed = Distance / Time
Speed needed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed needed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we need to convert 26/3 to a mixed number or a decimal. 26/3 = 8 2/3.

The remaining 24 liters is 8 2/3 liters of water."
"To find the answer, we need to know the age of Raymond. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at son's birth = years ago
25 - 23 = 2

Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

First, his first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.

Next, his next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the answer, we need to calculate the total number of hours the candle burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to multiply the number of each item by its cost and then add them together.

For shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50 = $49.50
For pants: 3 pairs * $22.50 = $67.50
For shoes: 3 pairs * $42 = $126

Now, let's add them together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.

Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will buy:

60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will buy 4 cartons of ice cream.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 cartons × $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 
Then, he traveled some distance before his second stop. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we need to find the distance from the end of the trip to his second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. If his second stop was 15 miles before the end, then the distance from the end to his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we add the distance before his first stop (20 miles) to the distance from the end to his second stop (45 miles). 
20 + 45 = 65 miles

So, Henry traveled 65 miles between his first and second stops.

65"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 11 = 18. 

We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

7x + 11x = 162
18x = 162
x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now, we know that Darrell's age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63 and Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first guess is 80.
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60.
The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first find out how many silver coins she has. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20.
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is 25% in decimal form). 
4 * 0.25 = 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both 20-minute periods:
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The cost of one yogurt is $5.00. So, the total cost of 60 yogurts is 60 * $5.00 = $300.00.

The final answer is: $300."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount of money he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he got is 13 x 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 x 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the amount of money he has left after buying the video games is $195 - $160 = $35.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he can buy with $35. Since each Lego set costs $15, we can divide $35 by $15 to find out how many sets he can buy. 

$35 ÷ $15 = 2.33

Since we can't buy a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to 2 sets.

So, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find out how many hours he runs in total per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total per week.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. 

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking. 

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and she spends a total of 6 hours, we can calculate the time she spends running and walking as follows:

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

Running speed = 2 * skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking:

Distance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Since Dana's walking speed is not given, we need to find it. We know that Dana's walking speed is half of her running speed:
Walking speed = Running speed / 2
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 2
Walking speed = 3 miles per hour

Distance traveled while walking = 3 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 12 miles

Now, we can find the total distance Dana travels by adding the distance she travels while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance = 12 miles + 12 miles
Total distance = 24 miles

The final answer is: 24"

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. 

When not holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames are 1000 feet away, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon when holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still eat 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to divide 200 by 250 to find out how many servings you can eat. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since a serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 by 5 to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is:
20 candles * $2.00 = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs:
20 candles * 1 pound = 20 pounds of beeswax
The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is:
20 pounds * $10.00 = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The net profit is -$160.00, which means Charlie is losing $160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first find out how many Post-it notes she used at the coffee shop.

She used 220 Post-it notes at the coffee shop.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, to find out how many she had initially, we need to add the Post-it notes she used and the ones she had left.

Initial Post-it notes = Post-it notes used + Post-it notes remaining
Initial Post-it notes = 220 + 23
Initial Post-it notes = 243

Now, we know that Candice initially had 243 Post-it notes. To find out how many were in the package, we need to subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number she had before purchasing the package.

Post-it notes in the package = Initial Post-it notes - Post-it notes initially
Post-it notes in the package = 243 - 80
Post-it notes in the package = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can divide $200 by $40 to find out how many blue ties he bought.

200 ÷ 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost $40 + 50% of $40.

50% of $40 is $20, so the red ties cost $40 + $20 = $60 each.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

10 x $60 = $600

The total cost of the ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties.

$200 + $600 = $800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of 120 units. 

3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

So, 90 units are occupied. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. 

120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per week.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens he sells per week by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he is traveling at 10 miles per hour, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the distance. 

Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he's removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he's removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he's already removing 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- 6 truck tires at $60 each will be 6 * $60 = $360
- 4 car tires at $40 each will be 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- 12 car tires at $40 each will be 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday is $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days. 
$520 (Thursday) is greater than $480 (Friday), so Thursday had higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we multiply 12 by 3 to get 36. 

Now, we add the 7 adopted kittens to the 36 kittens from Patchy and the 12 kittens from Trixie. 

36 (from Patchy) + 7 (adopted) + 12 (from Trixie) = 55

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean had 30 lollipops initially. 
Jean eats 2 lollipops. 
30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Now, Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. 
To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with lollipops.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight available for boxes by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes:

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 * 40 = $10.00

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: 
$40.00 (original bill) + $13.00 (extra fees) = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: 
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles per gallon."
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 2 * 3 = 6 hours watching TV per week.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 1 * 3 = 3 hours reading per week.

Now, let's add the hours he spends on TV and reading per week: 6 + 3 = 9 hours per week.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the hours per week by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to find the number of each type of gem.

Let's start with the rubies. We know there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, we can subtract 35 from 175 to find the number of rubies.

175 - 35 = 140 rubies

Now, we know there are 140 rubies. We also know there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. To find the number of emeralds, we can multiply the number of rubies by 2.

140 * 2 = 280 emeralds

Now we have the number of each type of gem: 175 diamonds, 140 rubies, and 280 emeralds. To find the total number of gems, we can add these numbers together.

175 + 140 + 280 = 595

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups per year.

The total amount of dog food used in a year is 180 cups (first 180 days) + 730 cups (rest of the year) = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags.

Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold by 11 (since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's).

Let's do the math:

Total copies sold = 88,000
Marilyn's copies = 10x
Harald's copies = x

Since Marilyn's copies sold 10 times as many as Harald's, we can write an equation:
10x + x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8,000"
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests. 

3/4 of 16 is 12. 

Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, 12 guests will attend. 

Now, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina needs. She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so for 12 guests, she needs 0.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2. So, the total cost will be 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate the amount for the adults and the children separately.

First, let's calculate the amount for the adults. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, we multiply 20 by 10.

20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Now, let's calculate the amount for the children. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, we multiply the number of children by 5 (half of 10 lbs).

5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the amount for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs.

200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

Ted needs 225 pounds of potato salad for the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the information given:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 
4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy must be 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can subtract 2 seconds from Lee's time to find Gerald's original time. 

Gerald's original time = Lee's time - 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 - 2
Gerald's original time = 36 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new speed, we need to multiply his original time by 1.1 (which is 100% + 10%).

Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time * 1.1
Gerald's new time = 36 * 1.1
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is 39.6"
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. 

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats. 
60 * 2 = 120 cats

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. 
So, we add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12. 
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180
180 - 12 = 168 rabbits

Now, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets. 
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

9 (Harry's hours) - 6 (James' hours) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, we need to multiply the final volume by 2.

32 ounces (final volume) * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we need to divide the total ounces by 16.

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so we subtract those from the total number of cars: 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, we subtract those from the total number of cars that drove through: 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

Then, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 1 * 40 = 40 plants.

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she already has: 80 - 40 = 40.

So, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections there are in 42 miles. 

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, it will take 10 minutes per section. 

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on those days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we need to subtract the time he watched on other days from the total time to find out how many hours he watched on Wednesday. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. To do that, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 

90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants:
2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas, we need to multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons.

Cost per gallon: $3.00
Number of gallons: 10

Total cost = Cost per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost = $3.00 * 10
Total cost = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the cashback rewards:
Cashback per gallon: $0.20
Number of gallons: 10

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost:
Total cost - Total cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups for both Beatrice and Marcell: 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

They ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet. 

Since the shore is 64 seconds away and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can divide 64 by 16 to find out how many times she rowed 20 feet. 

64 / 16 = 4

So, Julia rowed 20 feet 4 times. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in 20 feet. 

20 / 10 = 2

So, for every 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Since Julia rowed 20 feet 4 times, she took on 2 * 4 = 8 liters of water."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many birds are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
The original price was $180, and it increased by 50%, so the new price is: 
$180 + ($180 * 0.5) = $180 + $90 = $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is 90."

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and Lylah's salary was $30769.23. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
Adrien's new salary = $40000 + 40% of $40000
Adrien's new salary = $40000 + 0.4($40000)
Adrien's new salary = $40000 + $16000
Adrien's new salary = $56000

Lylah's salary four years later = $30769.23 + 40% of $30769.23
Lylah's new salary = $30769.23 + 0.4($30769.23)
Lylah's new salary = $30769.23 + $12307.6912
Lylah's new salary = $43076.9212

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

So, Jennie puts 20 stamps on the letters needing stamps. This means that the pile of already-stamped letters now has 30 letters.

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters that Jennie added from the current total of 30 letters.

   So, 20 elves quit. 
   Remaining elves: 60 - 20 = 40.

2. 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   Remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

There are 30 elves left."
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May: $500
Expenditure in June: $500 - $60 = $440

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.

Now, let's add up the total number of tickets used:
12 (Pam's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (Fred's roller coaster tickets) + 12 (their luge tickets) = 48 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 48."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we multiply 4 by 6 to get 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday. 

41 (total miles) - 4 (Monday) - 24 (Tuesday) = 13 miles

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian has 20 video games initially, but he lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we need to multiply Brian's current number of video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times 15 is 45. 
45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we need to divide the total number of unicorns by 3.
   27 ÷ 3 = 9

   So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. 
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we need to divide the number of Scottish unicorns by 3.
   9 ÷ 3 = 3

   So, there are 3 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost of the order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we need to multiply the number of questions by the time he spent on it.

Questions completed in the first test = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we do the same thing.

Questions completed in the second test = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, let's add the questions completed in both tests to find the total number of questions completed.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, we need to add the total number of questions in both tests to find the total number of questions.

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175 questions

Now, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions in both tests to find the number of questions left incomplete.

Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70 = 105 questions

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The answer is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to follow the given information:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's start with the queens. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, we can say that the number of queens is x. Then, the number of baby bees is 2x.

Now, we know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700. The total number of bees is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combine like terms:
7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 100

Now that we know the number of queens (x = 100), we can find the number of baby bees (2x = 200) and worker bees (4x = 400).

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours in a week.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his weekly earnings would be 14 * 10 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the items and then calculate the tax.

First, let's add up the cost of the non-food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of non-food items: $2 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $12

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. 
Tax = 10% of $12
Tax = 0.1 * $12
Tax = $1.20

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items:
$12 + $1.20 = $13.20

The total cost of the food items is $3 (eggs). 
Total cost = $13.20 (non-food items) + $3 (food items) = $16.20

The final answer is: $16.20"
"To find the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients. 

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, so 8 clients will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach. 
16 bottles of bleach will cost 16 * $2 = $32.

Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so 8 clients will need 8 * 1 = 8 packs of cloths. 
8 packs of cloths will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses will be $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Since Kim's total income is $92, his profit will be $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by 3, since he harvests every 3 months.

First, let's find the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John harvests every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples * 4 = 4000 pineapples

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

4000"
"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Johnny picks up 2125 legos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 30 bees leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. So, after the next 18 hours, the total number of bees that left is 45 + 60 = 105 bees.
6. Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours return. This is 45 bees (the ones that left in the first 12 hours).
7. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (45 bees) return to the hive.
8. So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 45 bees.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, then the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change. 

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's friends by 3 to find out Dorothy's friends. 

12 / 3 = 4

"To find out who wins, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

Steve's time: 
Distance = 3 miles
Speed = 440 feet per minute
Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, 
Distance in feet = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes

Tim's time: 
Distance = 2 miles
Speed = 264 feet per minute
Distance in feet = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time (36 minutes) is less than Tim's time (40 minutes), Steve wins the race. 

The winner (Steve) will be waiting for the loser (Tim) for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes."
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 x 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Carl bought, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies in each pack. 

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the cost of the cookies from the $10 bill.

$10 - $6 = $4

Carl receives $4 as change."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since you can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate all the fries left after the seagull.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, but since there were no fries left, this doesn't affect the total amount.
7. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Since the pigeons ate all the fries left after the seagull, and there were 5 fries left, the total amount of fries in the pack must have been 5 + 9 = 14 fries.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours together: 9 hours (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) + 8 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) = 17 hours.

The answer is 17."
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet. 
- A roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- A croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- A baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- 300 rolls: 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- 120 croissants: 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet
- 60 baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. So, she runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards per round. She does this 34 times, so she runs 180 * 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract 1500 from 6120. 6120 - 1500 = 4620.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Now we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the first equation: S = 2B = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 x 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 days in a weekend, so he walks 2 x 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each part and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs together and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so they have 80 x 8 = 640 legs.
Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so they have 90 x 6 = 540 legs.
Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to find the ages of each bird.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. 
Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds: 
8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first find out how much she pays per month. 

She has three debts: 
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

The total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to find 50% of $1000. 
50% of $1000 is 0.5 * $1000 = $500.

Now, we add this to the minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is 18000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to add the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

Time to peel each potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut each potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time to peel each potato by 60 and the time to cut each potato by 60.

Time to peel 60 potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes
Time to cut 60 potatoes: 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds

Now, we need to convert the time to cut the potatoes from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now we can add the time to peel and cut the potatoes:

90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

95"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total amount of money they made from selling lemonade. 

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50. So, the total amount of money they make per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

They made $25 in profit, and since profit is the difference between the total amount of money made and the total cost, we can set up an equation:

Total cost = Total amount made - Profit
Total cost = $10 * 5 (since they made 5 gallons) - $25
Total cost = $50 - $25
Total cost = $25

Since the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, the total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of Chinese people, we need to subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of Asians. 

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 Chinese people.

Since the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

160 (Chinese people) - 60 (boys) = 100 girls.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much Zaid has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity:
   Half of 2500 = 0.5 * 2500 = 1250

5. Calculate the remaining amount after donation:
   2500 - 1250 = 1250

6. Calculate the total amount spent on his daughter and wife:
   200 + 700 = 900

7. Calculate the final amount left:
   1250 - 900 = 350

The final amount Zaid will have is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs: 
Bo + Monic + Rani = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage.

For the first week, he worked 5 hours and earned 5 x $10 = $50.

For the second week, he worked 8 hours and earned 8 x $10 = $80.

To find the total amount he earned, we need to add the earnings from both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 is (3/4) * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how long it will take the less well-rounded team to complete the 4x400 meter relay, we need to calculate the time for each runner.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for all four runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per runner, so their total time is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (rolling 4, 5, or 6) and divide it by the total possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (rolling 2, 4, or 6) and divide it by the total possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

Since both probabilities are the same, the difference between them is 0%."
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide her mom's apples by 2. 

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out the total number of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we divide the remaining straw by 6 to find out the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are in 3 cages, we divide the total number of rats by 3 to find out the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

First, we find the interest for 1 month: 
$100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since the interest is for 3 months, we multiply the interest for 1 month by 3: 
$2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the interest to the original amount: 
$100 + $6 = $106

Mandy should give Benedict $106."
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's say the trader bought x bags of wheat.

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).

The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).

The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold for $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.

We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

$8x = $400

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 / 8
x = 50

So, the trader bought 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

$20.25 (tickets) - $4.50 (food) = $15.75 (food)

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets, food, and the rides. 

$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $33 (ride 1) + $33 (ride 2) = $88.00

Since they split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. 

$88.00 ÷ 3 = $29.33

The final answer is: $29.33"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many trees Tom planted in 10 years. 
   He plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

2. Next, we need to find out how many trees Tom chopped down in 10 years. 
   He chops down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

3. Now, we need to find out how many trees Tom had initially. 
   He started with 50 trees.

4. Next, we need to find out how many trees Tom had after 10 years. 
   He planted 100 trees and chopped down 20 trees, so he had 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

5. Now, we need to find out how many trees died. 
   30% of the trees died, so we need to find 30% of 80 trees. 
   30% of 80 is 0.3 * 80 = 24 trees.

6. Finally, we need to find out how many trees Tom has left. 
   He had 80 trees and 24 trees died, so he has 80 - 24 = 56 trees.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
3. Then, the neighbors painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink plastic flamingos. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
5. To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 x 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 x 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards Elaine collected:
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate.

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, we multiply the amount by 2.

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents.

Now, we add the amounts from both publishers to find Mark's total weekly earnings.

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. 
So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail:
11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"To find out how much John made that year, we need to calculate his total salary for the year and add the monetary reward.

First, let's calculate his total salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total salary for the year would be:

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 3 slices per omelet. For 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese. 

14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

The total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 31."

"To find the average of the six tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by 6. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
358 - 71 = 287

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
To do that, we multiply 93 by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, let's subtract 287 from 558 to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test: 
558 - 287 = 271

The final answer is 271."

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860."
"To find the weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   So, the cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 for each babysitting job and $4 for each lawn mowing job. To find out how many babysitting jobs she needs to do, we can divide $60 by $5, which is 12.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing jobs. Let's assume she does x lawn mowing jobs. Then, she earns $4x.

We know that the total amount she earns from babysitting and lawn mowing should be equal to $60. So, we can set up the equation: 12 + 4x = 60.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 12 from both sides: 4x = 48.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 12.

So, Sara needs to do 12 lawn mowing jobs to earn $60."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'r + 2' (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens).

The total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now, let's simplify the equation:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. 

Since the park is a rectangle, we have two lengths (6 miles) and two widths (1.5 miles). 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know that Gary walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the perimeter by his walking speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day to find out how many customers she counted on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

250"
"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes, and the big pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x gallons of water now.

We know that the big pool lost 16 gallons, so the big pool now has 2x - 16 gallons. Since the big pool has 4x gallons now, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

2x - 4x = 16
-2x = 16
x = -8 (this can't be true, so we'll try another approach)

Let's try another way. We know that the big pool has 4x gallons now, and the small pool has x gallons now. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4x = 4 * x
4x = 4x

This doesn't help us. Let's try another way. We know that the small pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes, and the big pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 4(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 4 = 4x + 16
4x - x = 16 - 4
3x = 12
x = 4

So, the small pool had 4 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the small pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes, the small pool now has 4 - 4 = 0 gallons of water.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. 

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total amount she needs ($352.00) by her hourly wage ($8.00) to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate 10% of the initial amount she borrowed. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200.

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of the initial amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 a month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

$165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (total paid) = $220.

The final answer is: $220."
"To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to know Harriet's age and the given relationship between their ages.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, we know Harriet's age and Zack's age. We also know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we have the ages of all three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age = (21 + 42 + 63) / 3
Average age = 126 / 3
Average age = 42

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66

Now, we find the average age in three years:
Average age in three years = (Harriet's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Adrian's age in three years) / 3
Average age in three years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in three years = 135 / 3
Average age in three years = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately.

Time spent on crossword puzzles: 3 puzzles * 10 minutes per puzzle = 30 minutes

"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to subtract the amount of water Celine used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters

Water left in the tank = Initial water - Water used
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90
Water left in the tank = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, we need to multiply the amount left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left in the tank
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank to find the final amount of water in the tank.

Final water in the tank = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
Final water in the tank = 30 + 60
Final water in the tank = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100. 
Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"To find out how much Chad owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal.

The base burrito is $6.50.
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. 
The total cost of these extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00.
He also adds 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The total cost of the extras is $4.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

The base burrito is $6.50, and the extras cost $4.50, so the total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.

Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost of the meal is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

He has a gift card for $5.00, so he uses that to pay for part of the meal. 
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest the first time, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest the first time.

Now, let's find out how many watermelons were left after Ashlyn took 36.

120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many watermelons were ready, we need to calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest the second time.

Now, let's find out how many watermelons were not ready for harvest.

84 - 63 = 21

"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide 42 by 3 to find out how many vines he needs.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 penpals left, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of minutes in a week by the number of minutes it takes him to write one page. 420 / 6 = 70 minutes per week.

So, Mike spends 70 minutes per week writing letters.

To convert this to hours, we divide 70 by 60. 70 / 60 = 1.17 hours per week.

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Now, let's add the extra minutes he had to the total minutes used:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

4. Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
5. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries.
6. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
7. After all the transactions, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 9 + x - 2 = 27.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 7 + x = 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x.

We know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. 

So, the difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28. This difference is equal to 2x (twice the amount of fish).

Now, we can set up an equation: 28 = 2x.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 28 / 2 = 14.

Since there are 14 fish in each aquarium, the answer is 14.

"To find the answer, we need to subtract the number of apps Travis deleted from the number of apps he had initially, then add the number of new apps he downloaded.

Initial number of apps: 61
Number of apps deleted: 9
Number of new apps downloaded: 18

First, subtract the number of apps deleted: 61 - 9 = 52
Then, add the number of new apps downloaded: 52 + 18 = 70

Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
10 wolves (last night) + 45 wolves (today) = 55 wolves
15 cougars (last night) + 12 cougars (today) = 27 cougars

Total number of animals Rick killed = 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82

The final answer is: 82"

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows is now 200 + 40 = 240.

He divides the 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall now has 240 / 20 = 12 cows.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 12 cows, 8 stalls will have 8 * 12 = 96 cows.

The final answer is 96."
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to first find the total weight of the wood. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

So, the total amount Nancy owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52.

52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.

Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits Andrea has is 52 + 24 = 76.

Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so the total number of fruits Jamal has is 44 + 48 = 92.

The total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12 (since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies).

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
36 + 30 = 66 cookies in total.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we need to divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs.

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5 cups

So Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

9,300 * 2/3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find out how many marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she already had (5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles) to the marbles she got from her friend (20 marbles).

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. We know that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find out how much money the girls have combined, we need to add up the money each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the money: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The girls have a total of $400 combined."
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: 9500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts:

1. Time to heat up the oil: 20 minutes
2. Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees: 20 minutes + 40% of 20 minutes
   40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
   Total time to heat up to 400 degrees = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes
3. Time to cook the chicken: 5 minutes less than the time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees
   Time to cook the chicken = 28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Now, let's add up the time: 
20 minutes (heating up) + 28 minutes (heating up to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 71 minutes

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."

"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in all three bags: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."

$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

The cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, so it takes 1/10 * 900 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from both scenes and the song: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

3. Then, we find out how many cards had the letter B on them: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter C on them: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. Now, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9 cards

So, the cards with the letter D on them are 9.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. 

Let's say Mico's current age is M and Marco's current age is M + 1 (since the sum of their ages is 20). 

We can write an equation: 
M + (M + 1) = 20

Combine like terms: 
2M + 1 = 20

Subtract 1 from both sides: 
2M = 19

Divide both sides by 2: 
M = 9.5

So, Mico's current age is 9.5 and Marco's current age is 9.5 + 1 = 10.5.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be 9.5 + 10 = 19.5 and Marco's age will be 10.5 + 10 = 20.5.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 19.5 + 20.5 = 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Sam's current age is x. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9, and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtract 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid.
$5 + $2 = $7.

The total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. 
The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.
The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, the total number of people is 15 + 30 = 45.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy needs 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find out how much space is taken up by the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total space taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the space taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches. So, the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find out how many beads are used. 

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week:
40 (Alani) + 80 (Braylen) + 120 (Margot) = 240 stories

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week:
20 (Alani) + 40 (Braylen) + 60 (Margot) = 120 stories (first week)
240 (second week) + 120 (first week) = 360 stories

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has. 

She has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money she has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we need to subtract 55 cents from 145 cents: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 x 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 
To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight that one truck can carry.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight one truck can carry:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". We can set up the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

So, she earns 15 * $5 = $75 for the online task."
"To find the points of each player, we need to calculate their points before the extra points.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so yes.
- Jim has 18 points, so no.
- Tony has 42 points, so yes.

Since they all have over 20 points, they get an extra point each. 
- Mike now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim now has 18 + 1 = 19 points.
- Tony now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up their points: 
22 + 19 + 43 = 84 points.

The final answer is 84."

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last.

42 / 14 = 3

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much the desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she paid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids went up by $50 three times. 

The first bid was $200. 
The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250.
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300.
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $350, $400, and $450. 

The final bid was $450. 

To find the total amount Carmen paid, we need to add the initial bid and the amount she paid for the last bid. 
$200 + $450 = $650.

The desk costs Carmen $650."
"To find the total distance John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Distance to work and back is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven in a week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven in a year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven in a year = 15000 miles
Total cost for miles driven = 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000

John also gets a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus he gets is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

Now, let's add the cost of miles driven and the bonus:
Total cost = $30000 + $1800 = $31800

The final answer is: $31800"

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books she has sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year. So, the total number of books she sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135.

Since she sold 200 books in total, the number of books she sold in the third year is 200 - 135 = 65.

Now, we know that she sold 45 books this year and 65 books in the third year. We also know that each book sells for 20 dollars. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900 dollars.

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to know how much weight Joey loses in one week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses in one week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply 2 pounds by 4 weeks to find out how much weight Sandy will lose in 4 weeks.

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Since Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take her 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. 
Adding $700 to that makes $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left. 
He has spent $1950 on the trip so far, so he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Cera was half as old as Noah, we can set up an equation: 
   Let's say Noah's age six years ago was x. 
   Since Cera was half as old as Noah six years ago, Cera's age six years ago was x/2. 
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, we can set up the equation: 
   x/2 + 6 = 46
   Solving for x, we get x = 40. 
   So, Noah's current age is 40 + 6 = 46.

2. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. 
   Since Noah's age six years ago was 40, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 40 = 120,000.

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the equation: 
   120,000 = (1/2) * current population
   Solving for the current population, we get: 
   current population = 120,000 * 2 = 240,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

We subtract the 2 people with previous commitments from the 8 people who couldn't come: 8 - 2 = 6 people.

Now, we subtract the 6 people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18 people.

So, 18 people show up for Martha's party.

2. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles in the store.
   Total marbles = 20 + 8 = 28

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight.
   Total weight = 28 * 2 = 56 kgs

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 56 kgs."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height. 

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 x $0.1
Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we multiply 30 by 3 to get the number of girls: 
30 * 3 = 90 girls

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we multiply 30 by 1/10 to get the number of nongendered children:
30 * 1/10 = 3 nongendered children

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to get the total number of children:
30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of sets of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since there is 1 electric pole for every 3 electric wires, there are 15 electric poles. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 

1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men. 

Number of men who left = 1/4 of 40 = 10

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 10 = 15

Since 15 men stayed, and we know that 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is 22 - 15 = 7.

Therefore, 7 women are left at the party.

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the information given:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26 (total pencils Jam has). 

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so Jam has 3 * 8 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Now, let's add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils. 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to divide 72 by 8 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used:

65 ÷ 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the weakening caused by the added cream. The problem states that the coffee becomes 15 milliliters weaker when 15 milliliters of cream is added.

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got and then divide that by 2 to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we multiply 5 by 7 to find the total number of new records: 5 * 7 = 35.

Now, we divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records: 35 / 2 = 17.5.

Since you can't trade half a record, we round down to 17 old records.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of 100. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, and the number of senior programmers is 3/5 of the total number of employees (because the remaining 3/5 are senior programmers), we can calculate the number of senior programmers as follows:

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = 3/5 * 100 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount = (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
Total amount = $80,000 + $144,000
Total amount = $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people at the third stop.

First, let's find out how many people were on the bus at the second stop. We know that 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the total number of people at the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

Now, we know that 5 people got on at the first stop. So, the total number of people at the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Since we know that 5 people got on at the first stop, we can say that the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 16 + 5 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can divide 40 by 1 to find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage points.

40 / 1 = 40 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 40 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

40 / 60 = 2/3 hours

So, it will take 2/3 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to follow the steps:

1. The customer spent $80 initially.
2. They used their rewards for $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.
3. The rewards are $1 off for every $20, so 4 rewards are $4 off.
4. The customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4 off, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.
5. Now, we need to subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the initial amount spent. 
   Initial amount spent: $80
   Rewards: -$4
   Coupon discount: -$8
   Total discount: -$4 - $8 = -$12
   Final amount paid: $80 - $12 = $68

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total tax first. 

Total tax for Job A = 20% of $15 * 2000 hours = 0.2 * 15 * 2000 = $6000
Net pay for Job A = $15 * 2000 - $6000 = $30,000

For Job B, we need to calculate the net income first. 

Net income for Job B = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax for Job B = 10% of $36,000 = 0.1 * 36,000 = $3600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3600 = $30,600

Since $30,600 is greater than $30,000, Job B has a higher net pay rate. 

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $30,600 - $30,000 = $600."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to first find the number of ruined castles. 

40% of 220 castles are ruins. 
40% can be written as 0.4. 
Multiply 0.4 by 220 to find the number of ruined castles: 
0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. 
Half of 88 is 88 / 2 = 44.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments.

Furniture United's offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
$3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and then divide by the number of people.

DJ has 8 guns
Nick has 10 guns
RJ has 1 gun
Richard has 5 guns

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of guns by 4.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar needed for suckers and fudge separately.

For suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces
For fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the sugar needed for suckers and fudge: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 x 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. 

Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chickens and cows there are. 

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can say that the number of chickens is 2 times the number of cows. Let's call the number of cows 'x'. Then the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write an equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's find out how many legs the animals have. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. 

The total number of legs is: 20 * 4 (cows) + 40 * 2 (chickens) = 80 + 80 = 160

"To find out how many balls Josh has, we need to count the number of balls he started with and the number he added each week.

Josh started with 3 balls.
He added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks.
So, he added 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 balls.

Now, let's add the balls he started with and the balls he added:
3 (initial balls) + 4 (added balls) = 7 balls.

However, Josh dropped 3 balls, and 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 
So, he has 7 - 1 = 6 balls left.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the weight of the blue beetle, we know the pink frog weighs the same as it. So, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The container weighs 20 pounds. To find the total weight, we add the weights of all the animals and the container: 
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 240 pounds

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first calculate the total cost of the shirts before the discount.

The cost of 1 shirt is $30. Since Davos bought 2 shirts, the total cost is 2 x $30 = $60.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 40% of the total cost. To find 40% of $60, we multiply $60 by 0.4.

$60 x 0.4 = $24

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Davos paid.

$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find the difference in the amount of money they make per day, we need to calculate the daily income from tractors and silos.

Daily income from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily income from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

The difference in daily income is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

The total cost of food, treats, and medicine per month is:
$100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost:
$220 * 12 = $2640

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first find out how much time he spent on other activities.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, let's add up the time he spent on these activities: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since this is 30% of his total time, we can set up an equation to find the total time:

30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she earned from her jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle already had $80 in her savings, so we need to add that to her earnings: $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Annabelle still needs $45 to save for the phone.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate how much money she has left after buying the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the mini-golf and arcade tokens:
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- Arcade tokens cost $5
Total cost for mini-golf and arcade tokens: $5 + $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the go-kart rides:
- 2 go-kart rides cost $10 each
Total cost for go-kart rides: $10 * 2 = $20

Now, let's add the total cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides:
$10 + $20 = $30

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Now, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of each friend's activities. Since each friend will play mini-golf ($5), get arcade tokens ($5), and ride the go-karts ($10), the total cost per friend is $5 + $5 + $10 = $20.

Now, let's divide the remaining money by the cost per friend:
$60 ÷ $20 = 3

So, Morgan can invite 3 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to first calculate how much she spends on lollipops each day. 

She buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, so the total cost is 4 x 25 cents = 100 cents. 

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 100 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, 100 cents is equal to $1.

Now, we know Marisa spends $1 per day on lollipops. To find out how much she saves, we need to subtract the amount she spends from her daily pocket money. 

Her daily pocket money is $5, and she spends $1 per day on lollipops. So, she saves $5 - $1 = $4 per day.

Since she saves $4 per day for 5 days, we multiply the amount she saves per day by 5. 

$4 x 5 = $20

2. Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left. 
   This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

3. Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs. 
   So, the amount of money he had left for buying candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

4. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the money he had left ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.
   $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, we need to solve for x. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2:
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities.

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance by the service interval.

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 675 miles is less than 18,000 miles, so the train will need service after the first trip.

So, the train will need service after 1 day."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each bed, we need to know the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds. 

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

Average = (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds

Total amount of stuffing needed: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time it took for the trip, we need to divide the total distance by the speed.

Time to his friend's house: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours
Time back home: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Total time: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The trip took 6 hours."

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3. 

Since a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:
4 * 3 - 5 = 7

Now, we know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * 7 = 21.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We have already calculated the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks (3), shoplifting (7), and physical violence (21). 

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total number of people kicked out for the above reasons from the total number of people kicked out:
50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

19"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can multiply Sara's points by 3. 
3 * 8 = 24

So, Erin has 24 points now. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract 14 from 24. 
24 - 14 = 10

Erin had 10 points before.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of gift and add them together.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add the costs together: $884 + $10 + $132 = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost after the 20% discount.

Original cost = $400
Discount = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Cost after discount = Original cost - Discount = $400 - $80 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. The next day, they sold double that number, so they sold 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.
3. On the last day, they sold half the amount from the previous day, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. However, 6 people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total: 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice, we need to add up the hours she practiced each day.

She practiced 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, she practiced twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 hours. 
So, 2 x 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 3 hours (Tuesday and Thursday) + 4 hours (Saturday) = 7 hours.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment.

40% of the total number of equipment is faulty, so we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400000
= 0.4 * 400000
= 160000

Since the total number of equipment is 400000, the number of functioning pieces is:

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of equipment - Number of faulty pieces
= 400000 - 160000
= 240000

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost per piece
= 240000 * (400000 / 400000)
= 240000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000."
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, Mary collects 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 x 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Axel's silver: 50
Anna's silver: 100
Total silver: 50 + 100 = 150

Axel's gold: 80
Anna's gold: 120
Total gold: 80 + 120 = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350."
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we need to multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total amount of money she makes from selling lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Since she spends $18 on supplies, her total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we need to divide the total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade. 

She sells 4 cups per hour, so we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell 36 cups. 

36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours. 

$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can write this as an equation: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52. 
50% of 52 is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 
So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. 
The total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 29. 
Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, 14 people can't make it, and 29 - 14 = 15 people will perform.

"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 
Netflix costs $10 a month. 
Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted price for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8. 
The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60. 
To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42.

So, Tim saves $42 by cancelling his cable subscription and getting streaming services."

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the total energy used in 8 hours a day. 

Energy used in 8 hours = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours)

Now, if Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, the energy used in 3 hours a day will be:

Energy used in 3 hours = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used and the new energy used:

Energy saved per day = 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he already took from his total goal.

Elliott's total goal is 10,000 steps.
He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
So, the total steps he took so far is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, we need to subtract the steps he already took from his total goal to find out how many steps he took during his jog.
10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

So, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, we need to subtract that from the time it takes to finish the book to find out how many minutes early Toby will be.

Time to finish the book - Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes - 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
Total amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the employees left. 
3/4 of 40 employees = 30 employees
Total amount paid in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. She bought 2 pounds, but the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, she paid for 2 pounds, but got 1 pound for free. The cost of the taffy is 2 pounds * $3/pound = $6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $6 + $2.50 = $8.50.

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $8.50 = $1.50.

The final answer is: $1.50"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 x $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 
$1200 x 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. 
$960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days.

She eats 2 cookies per night, so for 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 ÷ 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. 

First, we need to find the number of candles that have the defect. Since 5% of the candles have the defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05 (which is 5% in decimal form).

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

So, 2500 candles have the defect. Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since all the candles with the defect (2500) smell like wet dog, they also explode. 

Therefore, 2500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount. 

To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (30% = 0.3). 

Discount amount = $20 * 0.3 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4.

Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since they have a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D.

Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can say that the total number of bumps is 2C + D.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can say that C + D = 180.

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304. So, we can set up the equation 2C + D = 304.

Now we have two equations:

1. C + D = 180
2. 2C + D = 304

We can solve these equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into one of the original equations:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day. So, he traveled 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

In the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, in the first 6 days, Tom traveled 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day. There are 7 days in a week, so he traveled 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the total distance Tom traveled: 1040 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker. Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: 17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. Now, we have 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5. 
   3/5 * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18
4. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 20 months.

The first 6 months cost 6 * $8 = $48.
The next 8 months cost 8 * $12 = $96.
The last 20 months cost 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, let's add the costs together: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

"To find the cost of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total cost of the jeans. 

Since Cole saved $6 in total, and 1/3 of the savings came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's say the cost of the jogger jeans is x. Then, 1/3 of x is $6. So, we can write the equation: 
1/3x = 6
To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 6 * 3
x = 18

So, the jogger jeans cost $18. 

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write the equation:
18 = 28 - 6
18 = 22

Now, we know the tattered jeans cost $22. 

The difference between the cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
18 - 22 = -4

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds from the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds from the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
The price of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the prices of the soup, bagel, and cake: 
$5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first find out how much money he has from selling the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the money he has from selling the cards is the remaining 2/3 of the total amount. 

Let's say the total amount of money he has from selling the cards is x. Then, 2/3 of x is $50. 

We can set up the equation: 
(2/3)x = 50

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny has $75 from selling the cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can divide $75 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold:
75 / 1.5 = 50

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the total number of cards he started with is 3 times the number of cards he sold:
50 * 3 = 150

The final answer is 150."
"To find out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared, we need to calculate half of 36, which is 18. Since the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs, and 40 guests showed up, we can see that there are 40 - 18 = 22 extra guests. 

Since each guest got two hotdogs, the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests. The 22 extra guests did not get a second hotdog."

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost.
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132."

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
Twice of 75 is 150. 
So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
One-fifth of 150 is 30. 
So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money George spent on chips. 

Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 x 40 cents = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left.

Since he had 1% of his money left, we need to find 1% of 500 cents. 1% of 500 cents is 5 cents. 

So, George had 5 cents left. This means he spent 380 - 5 = 375 cents on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, the number of candy bars George bought is 375 / 75 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5

Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we multiply 3 yards by 3 feet to get 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we divide the area by the length: 
360 / 9 = 40 feet

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the room is a rectangle, we can use the formula: 
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike. 
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We also know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting James' swim time and bike time from James' total time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know how many miles the horse runs. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance the horse runs. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour, so in 0.5 hours, it will run 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay will be 16 * 3 = $48.

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30. 

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the money Michael has: 30 - 48 = -$18. Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money he made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 x $20 = $340 from those sales.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31.

He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 x $25 = $775 from those sales.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the total cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the colors from the six packets with eight colors each and the four packets with sixteen colors each.

Six packets with eight colors each: 6 * 8 = 48 colors
Four packets with sixteen colors each: 4 * 16 = 64 colors

Now, let's add the colors from both sets: 48 + 64 = 112 colors

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the regular price of popcorn is x.

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $12 + x + $3 = $15 + x.

The total cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the difference between the two costs is $2.

So, we can set up the equation: 
$21 - ($15 + x) = $2

Simplifying the equation:
$21 - $15 - x = $2
$6 - x = $2

Now, let's solve for x:
$6 - x = $2
-x = -$4
x = $4

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase.

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. The cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. 

Cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase = $900 + (20 * 20) 
= $900 + $400 
= $1300

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons. 

Cost of filling 170 balloons = (Cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase) * (170 / 20) 
= $1300 * 8.5 
= $11,100"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 1 = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find out how much money Jenna's jewels are worth, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she got.

Jenna started with 8 sapphires, but she traded 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She got 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of apples they eat per day by 30.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day. 
4 apples/day * 2 people = 8 apples/day
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

They eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
Number of bags needed = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags needed = 320 / 2
Number of bags needed = 160

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost will be:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards. 

Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors.

Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:

3400 / 2250 = 1.51

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, she earns 3 x 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, she earns 5 x 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 x 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Frederick has 10 plants.
2. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we need to calculate 60% of 10 and add it to 10.

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. 
6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 basketball cards

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box.
5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 baseball cards

In total, Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given away by 10 to find the number of students.
300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
20 x 45 cents = 900 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, we can convert 900 cents to dollars by dividing by 100.
900 cents / 100 = 9 dollars

Becky received a $1 discount, so we subtract 1 dollar from 9 dollars.
9 - 1 = 8 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid. 
Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
20 x 50 cents = 1000 cents
1000 cents / 100 = 10 dollars

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. 
10 percent of 10 dollars is 10 x 0.1 = 1 dollar
10 - 1 = 9 dollars

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. 
Kelly paid 9 dollars and Becky paid 8 dollars.
9 - 8 = 1 dollar

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find out how many pencils were used in total. 
   Since 1/5 of the pencils were used, we multiply 30 by 1/5.
   30 * 1/5 = 6 pencils used.

2. Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total number of pencils.
   30 - 6 = 24 pencils remaining.

3. Next, we find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year. 
   Since 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, we multiply 24 by 1/3.
   24 * 1/3 = 8 pencils left.

So, there are 8 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to first find the total length of the remoras. 

Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is 2 x 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot.

The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to divide the length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiply by 100.

(1 / 10) x 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find the total number of students, we need to know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

If 20 students do not have a desktop computer, and this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we can multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and they are going for 2 people, so the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The total cost of the trip is $15,400."

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount of money he gave up per orange.

Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60. 
2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10.
24 * 10 = 240.

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find out how much Jillian's handbag cost, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 x $80 = $240.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to feed his horses. He wants to feed them for 5 days.

Total amount of oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in one bag:

200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

"To find the cost of 2 packs of razors, we first need to calculate the total cost without the coupon. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and there's a buy one get one free deal, we can get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. So, the total cost without the coupon is $4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon. The new total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since we are asked to find the cost of each individual razor in cents, we need to convert the total cost to cents. $2.00 is equal to 200 cents.

Since there are 2 razors in each pack, we divide the total cost in cents by 2 to find the cost of each individual razor. 200 cents / 2 = 100 cents.

The final answer is 100."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall). 
So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the 10th girl is 60"" tall, we need to find the average height of the 3 girls on top. 
The average height of the 3 girls on top is (64"" + 64"" + 64"" + 60"") / 4 = 64"" (since the 10th girl is 60"" and we have 3 girls on top, so we use 3 out of 4 girls in the average).

The height of the next layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The top layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The average height of these 2 girls is (64"" + 64"") / 2 = 64"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
512"" / 12 = 42.67 feet.

The final answer is 42.67."
"Charisma works for 8 hours a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

She has a timer to remind her to walk for 5 minutes every hour. So, she walks 5 minutes per hour. In 5 days, she will walk 5 * 5 = 25 minutes per day.

To find the total minutes she walked in 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by 5. 25 * 5 = 125 minutes.

The final answer is 125."
"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find out how old she will be in 4 years. 

Since Brett is 14 years old now, in 4 years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Angela will be three times as old as Brett in 4 years, so Angela's age in 4 years will be 3 * 18 = 54 years old.

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 years from her age in 4 years. 
So, Angela's current age is 54 - 4 = 50 years old.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent, we need to calculate the cost of his morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many oranges they have, we need to add the number of oranges Ashley brought and the number of oranges Brianne brought. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the estimated cost of food. 

Let's say the number of guests is x. The cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25x.

To find when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

$200 / $20 = $x

$x = 10

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects they found together is 43. So, we can write an equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to follow the steps:

1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. 

3. The couch is 2 feet longer than 16 feet, so the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first find out how much money Suzie spent on the grape and green apple gum. 

She bought 2 packs of grape gum and 1 pack of green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2 per pack, so 2 packs will be 2 x 2 = $4. The green apple gum cost half as much, so it's $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $4 + $1 = $5. 

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $5 = $2. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, each pack costs $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 wood:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:
$24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

The final answer is 1600."

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week. 
So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of 10 trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) = 90
90 + 20 (farm sheep) = 110

The farm and zoo have 110 animals combined.

"To find out how much calorie deficit Andy needs, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose 30 pounds.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 
From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 * 30 = 105,000 calories to lose 30 pounds.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to lose 30 pounds by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 181 days ≈ 580 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 580 calories to reach his goal."

Now, let's find his cousin's age in 8 years. We know that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. 

First, we need to find Jame's age in 8 years. Since Jame is currently 22, in 8 years he will be 22 + 8 = 30.

Now, we know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. 

Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than this, his cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55.

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors.

Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is 80."
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the total distance he walks in a week.

Since he walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance to work is 3 miles, so the distance he walks each day is 3 x 2 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is 6 x 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 + 26 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

65"
"To find out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to calculate the total number of families contacted in each round.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are contacted.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are contacted.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are contacted.

To find the total number of families contacted in the fourth round, we add the new families contacted in each round: 
3 (first round) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120

So, 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3

Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 x 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than that, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

Now, let's add the costs together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $20.
10% of $20 is 0.10 x $20 = $2

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The change Carly gets back is $17."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the remaining $1500.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the remaining $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together:
$300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each guest, and there are 70 guests, he will need 2 x 70 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

92"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply 16 by 3. 
3 x 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. 
First, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day. 
Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. 
2 minutes more than 32 minutes is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we multiply 34 minutes by 3 to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day. 
3 x 34 = 102 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day. 
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how much John earns in a week, we need to multiply the number of hours he works per week by his hourly wage.

He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so he works 5 x 4 = 20 hours per week.

Since he earns $2 per hour, he earns 20 x 2 = $40 per week.

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we need to divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by the amount he earns per week ($40).

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: 3 x $40 = $120

So, the total cost for both subs is $40 + $120 = $160."
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 x 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons. Since these buttons have 4 holes each, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 x 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size: 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. 

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks 0.5 cups. 
Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

Juan's doctor wants him to drink 4 cups. 
To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract 4 from 5. 
5 - 4 = 1

Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight, we need to know the total weight of all three friends and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun has moved from the pyramid. 

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour. 

Since the sun moves for 10 hours, we multiply 5 degrees by 10 hours to find the total angle the sun has moved: 
5 * 10 = 50 degrees

Now, we add the angle the sun has moved to the initial angle of the pyramid: 
32 + 50 = 82 degrees

The final answer is 82."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to know the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 ÷ 5 = 4

So, James needs 4 packs of candles. 

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read in total. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we need to add the pages she read in the first week and the second week.

70 + 100 = 170

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3.

In total, Cody and Trevor ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract 7 from 12.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Shiloh's age in 7 years and then divide it by 3 to find his nephew's age today.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Since in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

To find the nephew's age, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

So, Shiloh's nephew is 17 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to follow the information given.

Richie scored 80 goals. 
Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we subtract 20 from Richie's goals to find Mark's goals: 80 - 20 = 60.
Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals to find Anna's goals: 80 - 45 = 35.

Now, we add up the goals scored by all three teenagers: 
Richie's goals: 80
Mark's goals: 60
Anna's goals: 35
Total goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell: 21
Price of each lemonade: $4

Multiply the number of lemonades by the price: 21 * 4 = 84

So, Mitchell made $84 that weekend.

To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we need to subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

Liam's earnings: $63
Mitchell's earnings: $84

Subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: 84 - 63 = 21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures. Since he spent an equal amount each day, he spent $70 / 4 = $17.50 per day. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he bought 17.50 / 5 = 3.5 wooden action figures. However, you can't buy half of an action figure, so he bought 3 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent his money on plastic action figures. He spent the remaining money, which is 70 - 17.50 = $52.50. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he bought 52.50 / 2 = 26.25 plastic action figures. Again, you can't buy a fraction of an action figure, so he bought 26 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 3 wooden action figures and 26 plastic action figures. So, he will have 3 + 26 = 29 action figures by the end of the week.

The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

There are 4 weeks in a month. 

Ford supplies 40 roses per week. 
So, in a month, he supplies 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, it orders 20 * 4 = 80 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, it orders 15 * 4 = 60 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, it orders 30 * 4 = 120 roses.

Total roses supplied to the shops in a month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford supplies 160 roses in a month, but the shops need 260 roses. 
So, Ford lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have left after 2 years, we need to calculate how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years will have 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Since Katina removes $100 from her account every month, we need to multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months. 

$100 x 24 = $2400

Now, we need to subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in her account.

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

$600"

Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00 = $60.00

Total revenue:
- Number of sandwiches sold: 10
- Price per sandwich: $7.00
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 

3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we need to multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room and then add the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $10512."

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. This value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8.
6. So, 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 is (4 / 100) * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time, we need to add the time of both movies. 

First, we need to convert the time of the first movie from hours and minutes to just minutes. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the second movie, which is 2 hours and 5 minutes. 
2 hours is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes, and 5 minutes is already given. 
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of both movies: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $100.00, which is 0.1 x $100.00 = $10.00.

The discounted price of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * 10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * 10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: 70 - 30 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. 
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour.
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200.
1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

So, Hannah needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add them up and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
His typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
His typing speed increased by 5 words, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

The average of Jared's typing speed is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find out how many seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

Initially, Alex invited 100 people. Each of them invited 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the total number of additional guests from her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the initial 100 guests, the 200 additional guests from the initial invitations, and the 18 additional guests from her friends. 

100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Alex needs 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

1. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.
2. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
3. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 x $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the beanstalk needs to double in height to be taller than Mark's window.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 x 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 x 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 x 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can divide 200 grams by 3 grams to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day.

200 grams / 3 grams = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week.

66.67 grams/day * 7 days = 466.69 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 467"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. 

Let's say the smallest angle is x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

We can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles: 
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms: 
6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal uses now, we need to first calculate the weight he used after increasing it by 50%. 

The original weight is 8 pounds. 
50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 
So, the weight after increasing by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Then, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 
So, the weight he uses now is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break it down by year.

Year 1:
- He gets 5 games for his birthday.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he has 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

Year 2:
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he has 22 + 12 + 5 = 39 games.

Year 3:
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's 12 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so that's 24 games.

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance it traveled (1200 miles) by the time it took (3 hours). 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles at this rate. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to divide the amount she makes in two hours by 2. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds in 2 hours. 
To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we divide 90 by 2: 90 / 2 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in one hour. 
Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds in 1 hour. 
Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour. 
Together, they make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds in 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
They make 105 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours they make 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate how much he spent in total.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up the money he spent:
$8 + $16 + $64 = $88

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the money he spent:
$100 - $88 = $12

15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the money earned in both periods.
$30 + $12 = $42

Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Now, we need to find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year. We know that the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles. 

So, for 4800 miles, the tire will rotate 4800 / 2 = 2400 times per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years the tire will last. We know that the tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 

So, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year: 
10,440,000 / 2400 = 4325 years

The tire will last for approximately 4325 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

To find the cost of 1 pump, we divide the total cost by the number of washings: $24.00 / 120 = $0.20 per pump.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.20 * 100 = 20 cents.

"To find out how much Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt is 30% off, so we multiply the price by 0.3 to find the discount amount.

Discount on shirt = $25 * 0.3 = $7.50

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt to get the sale price.

Sale price of shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the sale price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to get the total cost.

Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Let's assume a 8% sales tax for this example.

Sales tax = $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

Now, we add the sales tax to the total cost.

Total cost with tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Finally, we subtract the total cost with tax from Joe's initial $50.

Money left = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed for each dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so 8 ounces of meat.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

25% of 100 is 0.25 x 100 = 25.

60% of 25 is 0.6 x 25 = 15.

So, 15 riders can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright. 

Number of women who can stay upright = 60% of 25 = 0.6 x 25 = 15.

Number of men who can stay upright = 15 - 15 = 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, the price of the silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add them together:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find out how many stamps Max bought, we need to find out how many of each type of stamp he bought.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add up the number of each type of stamp: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. 

Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 - 55
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed

Distance = 75 miles (the distance between Bob and Tom)
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. 

We know Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. 
So, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Now, we know Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. 
So, Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to first find out how much he can afford to spend in total. 

Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $10 per class. Since there are 10 classes, the maximum amount he can spend is 10 * $10 = $100.

Manny has already paid $60 for the classes. So, the remaining amount he can afford is $100 - $60 = $40.

Since each class costs $10, the number of classes he can afford to miss is $40 / $10 = 4.

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many miles Lynn ran. 

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles. 

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, we add the cost of apples and oranges together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The answer is 216."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find the total amount of the raise, we need to calculate 5% of $20,000. 

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

Now, let's add the raise and the bonus to the original salary:

$20,000 + $1,000 (raise) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new salary by 12:

$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: 372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 10 suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

The cost of 10 dress pants is 10 * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500.

The cost of 3 dress shirts per suit is 3 * 10 * $60 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800.

The total cost of everything is $10,800."
"To find the total number of articles, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the answer, we need to follow the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

There are 8 portions in one bag, and 3 bags. 
8 portions * 3 bags = 24 portions

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the miles biked by each of them separately.

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 * 4.5
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 * 2.5
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the miles biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total miles biked.
Total miles = 54 + 25
Total miles = 79 miles

"To find the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Speed of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 24 / 4
Time = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Speed of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since it's half the speed of soil)
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 / 2
Time = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 + 4
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people he needs to buy cupcakes for. 

He needs 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. 

So, the total number of people is: 
1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since each person needs 2 cupcakes, we multiply the total number of people by 2:
27 * 2 = 54

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70. 

Initial likes = 2000 / 70
Initial likes = 28.57

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to 28 likes.

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes. 

Total likes = 28 + 20000
Total likes = 20128

The final answer is: 20128"
"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * 20 - 2 = 398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount, so the price per pomegranate was:
30 - (30 * 0.1) = 27

The total cost for Sheila was:
20 * 27 = 540

Now, let's find the difference between the two prices:
540 - 398 = 142

The final answer is 142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

In the first month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half of the total sales from green hats. So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is 2 x $400 = $800.

The total sales in the first month is $400 (red hats) + $800 (green hats) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month is 3/4 x $1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months is $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3.

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide 48 by 2 to find out how many eggs she needs.

48 / 2 = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide 24 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is 2."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

$15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $180,000.

The final answer is: $180,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork.

We know that it took 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, the cooking time for beans is 40 minutes.

Now, we need to add up the cooking times for all three foods: rice (30 minutes), beans (40 minutes), and pork (50 minutes). 

30 + 40 + 50 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information about the total number of animal legs and heads.

Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G.

We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of heads is 20, and each animal has one head. So, the total number of heads is S + G = 20.

Now we have two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve these equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G the same in both equations:

2) 2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract the first equation from the new second equation:

(2S + 2G) - (4S + 2G) = 40 - 70
-2S = -30
S = 15

Now that we know the number of sheep (S), we can find the number of geese (G) by substituting S into one of the original equations:

S + G = 20
15 + G = 20
G = 5

So, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first find the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

- Good days: 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 11
- Bad days: 8 (second 8 days)
- Neutral days: 8 (third 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 11

Now, we know that the total number of days is 30. We can set up an equation to represent this:

11 (good days) + 8 (bad days) + 11 (neutral days) = 30

However, this equation is not correct because we have double-counted the neutral days. We need to subtract the neutral days from the total number of days to get the correct total:

11 (good days) + 8 (bad days) + 11 (neutral days) = 30
11 + 8 + 11 = 30

Since we have double-counted the neutral days, we need to subtract 11 (neutral days) from the total number of days:

30 - 11 = 19

Now, we know that the total number of days is 30, and we have 19 days that are either good or bad. We know that there are 11 good days and 8 bad days. To find the number of good days left, we can subtract the number of good days from the total number of good days:

11 (good days) - 8 (good days) = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 ÷ 30 = 12 days.

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he had 1 toy per dog.

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.

When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left. So, the total number of dogs is 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

However, 3 dogs were gone, so the total number of dogs is 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys.

= 2400 / 5
= 480

So, Dylan invested $480.

3. Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. We subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount.

1200 - 480 = 720

4. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3.

2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3
= 1440 / 3
= 480

So, Frances invested $480.

5. To find out how much money is left for Skyler, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount.

720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they already have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to first find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. Since Karen works 3 hours per day, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per day. 

$20 per hour x 3 hours per day = $60 per day

Since we want to know how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2.

$60 per day x 2 days = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns you can make, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes it takes to make 36 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator can support a maximum load of 700 kg, the total weight of the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load by:
720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies. 
68 + 5 = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies. 
73 - 12 = 61

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's cookies. 
73 + 23 = 96

Now that we know how many cookies each person has, we can find the total number of cookies by adding them together. 
68 + 73 + 96 = 237

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending it by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's call the original length of the dress 'x'. 

Since the dress was extended by 50%, the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150% = 1.5). 

We know the new length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 
1.5x = 140

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 140 / 1.5
x = 93.33

So, the original length of the dress was approximately 93.33cm.

The final answer is: 93.33"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have.

They have 30 minutes in total. They've already spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Now, subtract 19 minutes from 30 minutes.

30 - 19 = 11 minutes

Catherine paid a total of $14."
"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

Now, let's add the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked together. 
30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we need to subtract 10 from the total number of cookies. 
90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's say the age of the younger twin is x. Since there's a twin who is 7 years older, the age of the older twin is x + 7.

There's also a set of triplets, but we don't know their ages yet. Let's call the age of the youngest triplet y. Since there are three triplets, the ages of the other two triplets would be y + 1 and y + 2.

We know that the combined ages of all four children are 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values for x and y that satisfy this equation. We can try different values for x and see if we can find a corresponding value for y.

Let's try x = 10. If x = 10, then 2x = 20. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

20 + 3y = 34

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3y = 14

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 14/3

Since y must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a year), x = 10 is not a valid solution.

Let's try x = 9. If x = 9, then 2x = 18. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

18 + 3y = 34

Subtract 18 from both sides:

3y = 16

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 16/3

Again, y is not an integer, so x = 9 is not a valid solution.

Let's try x = 8. If x = 8, then 2x = 16. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

16 + 3y = 34

Subtract 16 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

Now we have integer values for x and y: x = 8 and y = 6.

The age of the older twin is x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15.

The age of the younger twin is x = 8.

The age of the youngest triplet is y = 6.

The age of the middle triplet is y + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.

The age of the oldest triplet is y + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he has for homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes. 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4).

$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year. 
Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
So, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years they have been saving. 
They have been saving for 10 years.

Rong saves 240 coins per year. 
So, Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins in 10 years.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
2/5 of 20 is 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. 
Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Neil saves 336 coins per year. 
So, Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

Now, let's add the total coins Rong and Neil have saved. 
Rong has 2400 coins. 
Neil has 3360 coins. 
So, they have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins in total.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of $40.
60% of $40 is 0.6 x $40 = $24.
The total bill is $40 (vaccines) + $24 (heartworm check) = $64.

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $64 = $61.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. Since she has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and she has 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5.

8 * 5 = 40

So, Mia has 40 regular chairs. 

Now, we need to add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs she needs.

40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48

Since there are 57 people attending the function (42 adults and 15 babies), and Mia has 48 chairs, she needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Tom + Marta = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack:

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother."
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

This week: 3 boxes of Coco Crunch + 5 boxes of Fruit Loops = 8 boxes

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario.

Scenario 1: Both arms are down
- Her right foot taps at 300 times per minute
- Her left foot taps at 250 times per minute
- Total taps per minute = 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute
- Total taps for 5 minutes = 550 * 5 = 2750 taps

Scenario 2: Both arms are up
- Her right foot taps at 200 times per minute
- Her left foot taps at 200 times per minute
- Total taps per minute = 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute
- Total taps for 3 minutes = 400 * 3 = 1200 taps

Total taps = 2750 + 1200 = 3950 taps

The final answer is: 3950"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine.

The cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of the asphalt, which is 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75. 

The total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

The damage the pothole would cause to Ron's car is $450. 

So, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is $450 (damage) - $195 (total cost) = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
170 (normal chairs) - 20 (normal chairs sent) = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
23 (baby chairs) - 13 (baby chairs sent) = 10

Now, let's add the number of normal chairs and baby chairs left:
150 (normal chairs) + 10 (baby chairs) = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60. 

4/3 x 60 = 80 slices. However, since they only ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we need to subtract 2/3 of 60 from 60. 

60 - 2/3 x 60 = 60 - 40 = 20 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 60.

1 ½ x 60 = 90 slices. However, since they only ate ¾ of their pizzas, we need to subtract ¾ of 60 from 60.

60 - ¾ x 60 = 60 - 45 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends (20 slices) and the slices eaten by the two remaining friends (15 slices). 

20 + 15 = 35 slices.

There are 60 - 35 = 25 slices left."
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of 30 minutes.

2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Since the dog takes 20 minutes to eat the sausages, and the cat takes 30 minutes, we can find the average time by adding the time taken by both and dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 8 feet is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. 

So, we can write the equation: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 9:
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

The answer is 40%."
"To find the number of people who had voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by midday and then add the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

Now, let's find the number of people remaining by midday. 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

Next, let's find the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, let's find the total number of people who voted by 16:00. 2000 (voted by midday) + 2000 (voted between midday and 16:00) = 4000 people.

6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Now, add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat. 
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to find their individual ages first.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years old.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

Now, let's add their ages together: 
Dora's age + her father's age + her mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find out how many votes candidate B got, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 
Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

Now, we know that the total number of voters is 100. 
The total votes given to candidate A and candidate B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

The rest of the votes, which was given to candidate C, is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.

For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Since Peter started with 32 ounces of water, we subtract the total amount used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has.

250 * 1/2 = 125

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we multiply 125 by 2.
125 * 2 = 250

The third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

Final answer: 250"
"To find the total amount they spent, we need to add up the cost of each item.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas. 

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we add 90 to the number of bananas.

200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 fruits

George has 290 fruits."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the money she had. 

First, let's subtract the cost of the ball ($20) from the money Marissa had ($80). 

$80 - $20 = $60

Now, we know Marissa had $60 left. We also know that each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 x 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms will cost 20 x $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

60"
"To find the total number of books read, we need to know how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read (300) and Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read. 

300 + 150 = 450

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so we add that to the total. 

450 + 150 = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
Plus, she earns an additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
Plus, she earns an additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so:
$30 + $5 = $35

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 (Monday) + $35 (Wednesday) = $100

Tanya earned $100 for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 - 16 = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We also know that he made $60 from eggplants. To find out how much he needs to make from corn, we subtract $60 from $135. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we need to divide $75 by 25 to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for.

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = 0.5 * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

There will be 276 wheels left."
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Find the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

Step 2: Find the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining.

Step 3: Find the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies. We can calculate it as follows:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.

Step 4: Find the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
200 * 6 = $1200.

Step 5: Find the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
160 * 5 = $800.

Step 6: Find the cost of the normal movies.
Since there are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
240 * 10 = $2400.

Step 7: Find the total cost of replacing the movies.
We can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

They drove at 50 miles per hour. Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we need to find half of their driving speed first. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. 

Now, subtract 5 miles per hour from 25 miles per hour to get the hiking speed: 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, multiply the hiking speed by the time: 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so Ava jumps on 8 + 8 = 16 enemies. Emma jumps on 16 - 8 = 8 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. 

Emma's time is 30 - 4 = 26 seconds. Ava's time is 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Emma's score is 8 * 10 + 15 * 5 + 26 = 80 + 75 + 26 = 181 points.

Ava's score is 16 * 10 + 12 * 5 + 30 = 160 + 60 + 30 = 250 points.

The difference between their scores is 250 - 181 = 69 points.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's subtract 30 dollars from 64 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by 2 since the other two pizzas cost the same amount. 
34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For 2 days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish. Since you can't have a negative number of fish, this means the sales assistant took out all the orange fish. 

Now, Bob has 4 white fish. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, he must have 2 * 4 = 8 orange fish.

Since the sales assistant took out all the orange fish, Bob must have bought 17 orange fish. 

The number of white fish he bought is 17 - 4 = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy travels 5 days * 10 miles per day = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas he uses in a week. We can do this by dividing the total distance by his car's fuel efficiency:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we multiply the number of gallons by the price:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties.

Carrie had 10 twenties. She spent 3/5 of them, which is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. 

Since each twenty is worth 20 dollars, she spent 6 * 20 = 120 dollars from the twenties.

Carrie had 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars. So, she spent 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars from the quarters.

The total amount she spent is 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

The final answer is: 155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, so the number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 (smart) + 5 (analog) = 15.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first find out how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

$150 - $50 = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, Carson needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to the desired temperature."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group had.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The answer is 12."

The original price of the jeans is $40. The discount is 25% of the original price. 

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10.

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill.

$50 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over."

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so it will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds to sing it twice.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so it will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds to sing it once.

Now, let's add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work. 
Billy's total earnings = $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's total earnings = $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she played 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Now, let's add the hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours needed: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 40 * 2 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice the fourth graders')

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Total students in the school: 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100

"To find the total amount of tea that was consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to add the amount consumed to the amount left.

Total amount of tea at the beginning = 38 (consumed) + 10 (left) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert 48 quarts to gallons by dividing by 4.

48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

He sold 150 candies, so to find out how many he has left, we subtract 150 from 200: 200 - 150 = 50.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number doubles to 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number doubles to 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number doubles to 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number doubles to 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number doubles to 320 students.

To find the additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide $105 by $0.25 to find the total number of branches.

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals together: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 15 - 1 = 14 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 24 - 1 = 23 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 20 - 1 = 19 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 42 - 1 = 41 petals

Now, let's add the remaining petals together: 
14 + 23 + 19 + 41 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows. 35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (marshmallows used) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, we need to subtract those from the remaining marshmallows. 17 (remaining marshmallows) - 3 (dropped marshmallows) = 14 marshmallows left.

Now, let's divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 14 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 7 S'mores per kid.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long each person played and then multiply that by the cost per game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes, his friends can play for half that time, and the better friend can play for 1.5 times that time. 

20 minutes is 1/3 of an hour. 
Half of that is 1/6 of an hour. 
1.5 times that is 1/4 of an hour.

Since they played for 4 hours, we can divide 4 hours by the time each person can play in an hour. 

Jack played 4/1 = 4 hours. 
His friend played 4/6 = 2/3 hours. 
The better friend played 4/4 = 1 hour.

Now, we need to convert the hours to minutes. 
Jack played 4 hours * 60 minutes = 240 minutes. 
His friend played 2/3 hours * 60 minutes = 40 minutes. 
The better friend played 1 hour * 60 minutes = 60 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the cost. 
Jack played 240 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 12 games. 
His friend played 40 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 2 games. 
The better friend played 60 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 3 games.

The total number of games played is 12 + 2 + 3 = 17 games. 
The cost per game is 1 quarter, so the total cost is 17 * 0.25 = 4.25 dollars.

The final answer is 4.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar used is also x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

We also know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. Let's call the amount of citrus zest and fragrance y ounces.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

x (salt) + x (sugar) + 2x (oil) + y (citrus zest) + y (fragrance) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x + 2y = 10

We know that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, so we can substitute x for y:

4x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5/3

Now that we know the amount of salt, we can find the amount of oil. Since the amount of oil is 2x, we multiply 2 by 5/3:

2 * 5/3 = 10/3

So, Tanya uses 10/3 ounces of oil.

10/3"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 at the market.

4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes he already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, let's subtract:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 x 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 8 cars. Then, he gives away 16 cars to his mother. So, he has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations ($50,000) from the total amount raised ($175,000).

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked for half of 8 hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 
480 + 240 = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had gone. 
   To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 70 * 0.5 = 35.
   So, 35 cars left the parking lot.
4. To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at that time: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 x $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, the total amount he earns per day is 30 x $6 = $180.

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find the weekly earnings: $180 x 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game, we need to know how many points Julie scored in the first game. 

Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, and Sasha scored 14 points, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add up the points Sasha scored in both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins in each package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins.

88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Then Smendrick has 3x cards.

Since Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards.

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:
Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color.

She had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and then subtract the refund amount from the original purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
Weight: 4 pounds
Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles
Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Total shipping cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Original purchase price: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total shipping cost: $3.00
Refund amount: $24
Total amount lost: $3.00 - $24 = -$21

Since the refund amount is more than the shipping cost, Milly will actually get a refund of $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan started with $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40. Since she can't have a negative amount of money, this means she actually spent more than she had.

The correct answer is: Mulan doesn't have any money left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she does her makeup 6 * 4 = 24 times in a month. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, so she spends 0.25 * 24 = 6 hours in a month doing her makeup.

Now, let's add the time she spends on each activity: 72 (videos) + 8 (writing songs) + 6 (doing makeup) = 86 hours.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the items Angela needs installed and the cost of the additional items.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items Angela needs installed:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the extra items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the extra items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items
13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

Now, let's add the cost of the standard items:
$129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (extra items) = $324.00

The total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information given.

Eva has saved $20.00.

Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's money, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4 (which is 40% in decimal form). 
$30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's money to find Roy's money.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and finally how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours
Distance = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. 

Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide 18 hours by 3 to find the time it would take for 1 kangaroo to travel across the highway. 

18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours for 1 kangaroo

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is 1/2 of the speed of a kangaroo. 

Since 1 kangaroo takes 6 hours to travel across the highway, a turtle will take twice as long because it's traveling at half the speed. 

So, 1 turtle will take 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we have 4 turtles, so we multiply the time it takes for 1 turtle by 4. 

4 turtles * 12 hours = 48 hours

Now, let's add the money she already has in her purse, the money she earned from her job, and the money her mom gave her:
Let's call the amount of money she has in her purse 'x'. 
We know that she needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has is $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + $230 = $450

Now, subtract $230 from both sides of the equation:
x = $450 - $230
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

Now, let's find out how many dishes Peter has. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find out how many dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm.

Farm X had 55 goats initially and 10 goats were sold. 
55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.

Farm Y had 45 goats initially and twice as many goats were sold as in Farm X. 
Since 10 goats were sold from Farm X, 10 * 2 = 20 goats were sold from Farm Y.
45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. 

To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought: 
2640 / 24 = 110

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 x $3) = $48.

The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the total time it takes to clean half of the rooms, we need to first find the total time it takes to clean all the rooms. 

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. 
So, the total time to clean all the rooms is 90 * 20 = 1800 minutes.

Since we want to find the time to clean half of the rooms, we need to divide the total time by 2. 
1800 / 2 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
900 / 60 = 15 hours.

The answer is 15."
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to follow the steps:

1. In the first year, they will build 12 homes.
2. In the next year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.
3. In the third year, they will double the amount of homes from the second year, which is 2 * 36 = 72 homes.

Now, let's add up the total number of homes built over the three years:
12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 72 (third year) = 120

The town will have built 120 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am 3 years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:
- Let B be my brother's age.
- Let S be my sister's age.
- Let I be my age.

From the first statement, I can write an equation: I = B - 3.
From the second statement, I can write another equation: I = S + 2.

Now, let's express my mom's age in terms of B: Mom's age = 3B - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: I + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Now, substitute I from the first equation into the sum equation: (B - 3) + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5B + S - 4 = 87.

Now, substitute I from the second equation into the sum equation: (S + 2) + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 4S + 4B + 1 = 87.

Now we have two equations:
1. 5B + S - 4 = 87
2. 4S + 4B + 1 = 87

We can solve these equations by multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of S equal:
1. 20B + 4S - 16 = 348
2. 20B + 20S + 5 = 435

Now subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate B:
(20B + 20S + 5) - (20B + 4S - 16) = 435 - 348
16S + 21 = 87

Now, subtract 21 from both sides: 16S = 66

Divide both sides by 16: S = 66 / 16
S = 4.125

Now that we know S, we can find I using the equation I = S + 2: I = 4.125 + 2
I = 6.125

Now that we know I, we can find B using the equation I = B - 3: 6.125 = B - 3
B = 6.125 + 3
B = 9.125

Now that we know B, we can find Mom's age using the equation Mom's age = 3B - 1: Mom's age = 3(9.125) - 1
Mom's age = 27.375 - 1
Mom's age = 26.375

The final answer is: 6.125"
"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs. 

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs.

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. This will give him 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks, which is more than the 54 he needs."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.
2. After the first day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
3. On the second day, the amount of water doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons.
4. On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.

Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how much money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 

40 customers * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we need to find 10% of $800. 

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80

Now, we subtract $80 from $800 to find out how much Julieta received.

$800 - $80 = $720

To find the total amount of money they received, we add the amount received by Rafaela and Julieta.

$800 + $720 = $1520

The final answer is: 1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
So, the total number of oranges she gave away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer had 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to know how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. 

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. 

To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can write the equation: 
x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 70 - 30 
x = 40

So, Gretchen had 40 silver coins. 
To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Then, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

So, there were 480 burritos leftover from the picnic.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. Let's add them up: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that together, they have 85 books, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find out how much the sweet potatoes weighed. 

Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, that means Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. 

$160 ÷ 4 = $40.

The answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
Tobias ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36 pieces remaining.

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26 pieces remaining.

On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.
26 - 14 = 12 pieces.

So, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00. To find the cost of 1 bottle of soda, we divide $21.00 by 7. 
$21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00. To find the cost of 1 bottle of water, we divide $8.00 by 4.
$8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water to find the total cost.
$9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.

Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x. 
Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. 
We know the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. 
So, we can write the equation: 
11x = 121 
To find x, we divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 
Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. 
Since a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5: 
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11 
Speed of whirligig = 55 

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first find out how much she pays for the salad and the yogurt together. 

The salad costs $6. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods. To find out how much she pays for the carrots, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost. 

$11 - $9 = $2. 

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. 

To find out how much she pays for one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2. 

$2 / 2 = $1. 

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's say the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn is x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can set up an equation: 
6 = 5x + x
6 = 6x
x = 1

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times.

Since she made $80 in total, and she made $6 from mowing lawns, she made $80 - $6 = $74 from lemonade sales.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the information given:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he works in a month and multiply it by his hourly wage.

He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time it's for 3 hours. So, the total hours he works in a month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

He earns $25 per hour, so his total earnings in a month would be 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit would be $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many notebooks Joseph had.

7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't have a fraction of a notebook)

Now, we know Joseph had 2 notebooks. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

12 - 2 = 10

Joseph has 10 fewer notebooks than Martha."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first find out how many miles Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1/5 and adding it to Dijana's distance.

Dijana's distance = 50 miles
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50) = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took. 

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: 
96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 
Daniel didn't read any pages today.

Now, let's compare the total pages they read:
Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages
Daniel read 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read:
28 - 13 = 15

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To find out how many bowls of soup Calvin has, we need to know how many bowls he has in total. Since he can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say he has 8 child's bowls (because 8 is a multiple of 4). 

Now, Calvin, his wife, and two children will eat 4 bowls. So, 4 bowls will be eaten. 

8 (total bowls) - 4 (eaten bowls) = 4 bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the remaining 4 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

4 / 2 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 / 4 = 5 times the material. 
So, for 20 small masks, she would need 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material.

For large masks: 
She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material. 
So, for 8 large masks, she would need 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material.

In total, Jo would need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets per movie = 27 tickets

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a day, he sleeps for 10 hours * 2 (for 2 days) = 20 hours.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's subtract the total hours he spends on these activities from the total hours in a day: 
24 (total hours in a day) - 20 (sleeping hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking dog hours) = 24 - 20 - 8 - 1 = -5

Since we can't have negative free time, we need to recheck our calculation. Let's recheck the calculation:
24 (total hours in a day) - 20 (sleeping hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking dog hours) = 24 - 20 - 8 - 1 = 24 - 29 = -5

Wait, that's still negative. Let's recheck again:
24 (total hours in a day) - 20 (sleeping hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking dog hours) = 24 - 20 - 8 - 1 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = -5

We made a mistake. Let's recheck again:
24 (total hours in a day) - 20 (sleeping hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking dog hours) = 24 - 20 - 8 - 1 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 - 29 = 24 -

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 by dividing 30 by 5, which is 6. So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Now, we need to subtract the marbles Dean gave to Jamie and the marbles he gave to Donald from the total number of marbles he had. 

30 (initial marbles) - 6 (marbles given to Jamie) - 10 (marbles given to Donald) = 14

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'A' and Duncan's current age as 'D'. We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

2. We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as: D - 8 = 2(A - 4).

3. Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation: 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4).

4. Simplify the equation: 52 = 2A - 8.

5. Add 8 to both sides of the equation: 52 + 8 = 2A.

6. Simplify the equation: 60 = 2A.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: 60/2 = A.

8. Simplify the equation: A = 30.

9. Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years: A + 8 = 30 + 8.

10. Simplify the equation: A + 8 = 38.

The final answer is 38."
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

Now, we have the number of acres in both farms: 
Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres 
Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres 

To find the total number of acres, we add them together: 
200 + 500 = 700 acres 

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons. 

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. 
20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total. 
58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna, we can find out how many yellow balloons there were by dividing the total number of bologna thrown at yellow balloons by 3.
18 / 3 = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. The cost of 2 balloons is $0.5, so the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * 0.5 = $6. 

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total amount spent on ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. 

$31 / 2 = $15.5

The answer is 15.5"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

First, let's add up the total number of fruits Kira bought:

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate how many slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices they eat per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to multiply the number of years she has been collecting shells (5 years) by the number of shells she collects each month (1 shell). 

5 years * 1 shell/year = 5 shells

Since she has been collecting shells for 5 years, and she has 5 years left until her 10th birthday, we need to add the number of shells she will collect in the next 5 years.

5 years * 1 shell/year = 5 shells

So, in total, Martha will have 5 + 5 = 10 shells by her 10th birthday.

10"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row. 

27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups per row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and there are 9 cups in each row, she must have 9 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide 24 berries by 2 trips to find out how many berries he can pick per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to find half of the pool's water. 
Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

After 6 days, the tank will be emptied 6 * 500 = 3000 gallons. 

So, the remaining water in the tank will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's add the calories of the mini pastries together:
200 (mini cinnamon rolls) + 150 (mini blueberry muffins) = 350 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 350."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how far the bus went, we multiply the speed of the bus (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 5
Distance = 300 miles

To find out how far the car went, we multiply the speed of the car (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours).

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 8
Distance = 240 miles

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus went than the car. To do that, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled.

Difference = Distance of bus - Distance of car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Peter's age is P, Paul's age is P + 10, and Jean's age is P - 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than Jean).

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + (P - 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3P = 100

Divide both sides by 3:

P = 33.33

Since age can't be a fraction, we can round down to 33 (as you can't be a fraction of a year old).

The final answer is 33."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the initial number of balloons each person had and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 balloons. Maria had 1 balloon. So, the total number of balloons initially is 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (9) and the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so 10 x 5 = 50 boxes.
They already own 10 boxes, so 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so she spat a total of 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so she spat a total of 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance spat = (400 + 420) / 2
Average total distance spat = 820 / 2
Average total distance spat = 410

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the total money made from the Widgeteer 3000 in 30 days is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

The total money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 in 30 days is 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"To find out how much James spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs first. 

The original price of each CD is $15. Since James got them for 40% off, we need to find 40% of $15 and subtract it from $15.

40% of $15 is 0.4 x $15 = $6. 
So, the price of each CD after the discount is $15 - $6 = $9.

James bought 10 CDs, so the total cost is 10 x $9 = $90.

He sold 5 CDs for $40. To find out how much he made, we need to subtract the cost of the 5 CDs he sold from the total cost.

The cost of the 5 CDs he sold is 5 x $9 = $45.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Swimming distance = 60% of 20 miles
Swimming distance = 0.6 * 20 miles
Swimming distance = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 5: Calculate the remaining distance James has to swim.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Swimming distance
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Step 6: Calculate the speed James swims at the end.
New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Step 7: Calculate the time James spends swimming the remaining distance.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour

We know Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation: 
Marcus = 0.5 * Leo

We also know Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna. 
Marcus = Deanna - 5
Marcus = 26 - 5
Marcus = 21

Now we can equate the two expressions for Marcus:

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Bahati scored x + 10 points.
Azibo scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points is 45. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points. 
Azibo scored 5 + 20 = 25 points.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes by 15.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per 30 reports = 60 sets of 30 reports

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 30 reports, which is 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to bed at 10 p.m. So, the total time she usually sleeps is 8 hours. 

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, the time she woke up is 5 minutes earlier, which is 11:55 p.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to bed at 11:55 p.m. and woke up at 2:38 a.m. The time she was asleep is 2:38 a.m. - 11:55 p.m. = 2 hours 43 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. So, the time she was asleep during that period is 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep in her bed and the time she was asleep during the sleepwalking period. The total time she was asleep is 2 hours 43 minutes + 23 minutes = 3 hours 6 minutes.

To convert this to minutes, we multiply the hours by 60 and add the minutes. 3 hours * 60 = 180 minutes. 180 minutes + 6 minutes = 186 minutes.

The final answer is: 186"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons and received 6 more for his birthday. 

So, the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has now is 16 + 6 = 22 measuring spoons.

Jonathan had 24 measuring cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 measuring cups + 22 measuring spoons = 46 utensils.

46"
"To find the total number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

Since 100 beds are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 100 = 900 beds

Now, we need to calculate the number of days in 2 weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 * 14 = 700 patients

The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
900 - 700 = 200 beds

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails sent per day = 16
   Work emails = 7
   Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   Non-work emails = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to family.
   Family emails = 2/3 of non-work emails
   Family emails = (2/3) * 9
   Family emails = 6

3. Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Boyfriend emails = 1/3 of non-work emails
   Boyfriend emails = (1/3) * 9
   Boyfriend emails = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we multiply Aliya's age by 3 to find Shawna's age. 

3 * 3 = 9

So, Shawna is 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find her father's age.

5 * 9 = 45

Shawna's father is 45 years old.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can divide 2 by 2 to find out how many balls Jeffrey carried. 
2 / 2 = 1

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can multiply 2 by 2 to find out how many balls Jordan carried. 
2 * 2 = 4

Now we know that Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, and Jordan carried 4 balls. To find the total number of balls, we need to add the number of balls each boy carried. 
2 + 1 + 4 = 7

The coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day, we need to add the holes dug each day: 
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we multiply the number of holes by 4: 
31 * 4 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to subtract the holes filled in on the third day to find the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day: 
124 - 2 = 122 holes.

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, we need to subtract the holes dug on the first three days from the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day: 
122 - 31 = 91 holes.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the supplies cost and add it to the supplies cost.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms again:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we need to multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 10
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 * 2
Distance = 36 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 * 5
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird flies south for 300 miles and then flies north for 36 miles, we need to subtract the distance flown north from the distance flown south to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.
Total distance = 300 - 36
Total distance = 264 miles

The final answer is: 264"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
At the office party, she got 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.
Her friends gave her 4 dozen (48) brownies.
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.
Now, subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

So, Nani's sister is 8 - 6 = 2 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
Nani's age: 8 years
Brother's age: 16 years
Sister's age: 2 years

Total age: 8 + 16 + 2 = 26 years

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total number of players.

Total number of players = 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she had initially.

240 - 4 = 236 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find 1/4 of 236.

1/4 * 236 = 59

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had.

236 - 59 = 177

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 177 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:

Half of 50 states is 50 / 2 = 25 states
India has 4 more than that, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states

Now, we add the number of states in both countries: 
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."

Now, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on Sunday. 
On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. 
On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
So, on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned from gingerbread. 
He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday and 15 boxes on Sunday. 
So, the total number of boxes of gingerbread is 10 + 15 = 25.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Emil's current age is 19, and his dad's current age is x, and his brother's current age is y.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation:

24 = (1/2)x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

48 = x

So, Emil's dad is 48 years old now.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation:

24 = 2y

To solve for y, we divide both sides by 2:

12 = y

So, Emil's brother is 12 years old now.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages:

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the space needed for each plant and the space between them. 

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there's 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. 
So, the total space needed for each plant and the space between them is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, let's divide the total space by the space needed for each plant and the space between them to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. So, it cooled the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours. So, it cooled the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour, so it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total change in temperature. The room was initially cooled by 6 degrees, then cooled by 12 degrees, and then warmed up by 4 degrees. So, the total change in temperature is 6 - 12 - 4 = -10 degrees.

1. Let's say Bill's dad was x years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
2. Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time. So, Bill's age at that time is 3x.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years.
4. We know that Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, and his dad's age at the second sighting is x + 75 (since 75 years have passed).
5. Since Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, we can set up the equation: 3x = x + 75
6. Solving for x, we get: 2x = 75, x = 37.5
7. Since x represents Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we can find Bill's age at that time by subtracting 75 from x: 37.5 - 75 = -37.5. However, age can't be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

1. He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
2. He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
3. He writes 2 checks per month for the church, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. He writes 1 check every 3 months for the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to first find the length of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add up the time for all three wolves: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate how much money Adam received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

In total, Adam received $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's add Akbar and Alessandro's ages: 3 + 4 = 7
4. Since the total age is 20, we subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13
5. This 13 is the sum of Helene's age and Wilfred's age.
6. We know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 
7. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. 
8. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10
9. Now we know Helene's age is 10, so we subtract it from the sum of Helene's and Wilfred's ages: 13 - 10 = 3
10. Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out how much money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute to make the total amount three times the amount Walter has collected.

Let's say the lawyer's contribution is x. Then, the total amount will be $2000 + x. We know that this amount should be three times the amount Walter has collected, so we can set up the equation:

$2000 + x = 3 * $2000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$2000 + x = $6000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides, we get:

x = $4000

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $4000.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of 100 guests. 

Half of 100 is 100 / 2 = 50.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide 50 cookies by 15 cookies per person to find out how many people were in the church.

50 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 3.33 people

Since you can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 3 people."
"To find out how much each adult gets, we need to know the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume each kid gets 1 slice. 

So, each adult gets 2 slices. 

Now, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 4 kids and each kid gets 1 slice, the total number of slices is 4. 

Since each adult gets 2 slices, the total number of slices is 4 (for kids) + 2 (for adults) = 6 slices.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Each adult gets 2 slices out of 6 slices, so the percentage is (2/6) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his tasks.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.
Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
Cooling the cake takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we need to subtract 3 hours from the serving time of 5:00 pm to find the latest start time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find the total earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The total weekly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $75 + $45 = $120.

The total monthly cost is $120 * 4 = $480.

The total earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost of renting the studio, which is $480 - $300 = $180.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $180."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so we divide 64 by 4: 64 ÷ 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7: 56 ÷ 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box Martha has from the number of chocolate bars per box Peter has: 16 - 8 = 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

3/5 of 50 is (3/5) * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. In a year, there are 12 months. 

The total number of babies born in a year is 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the original population and the babies born. 

Total porcupines = 50 (original population) + 1440 (babies born) = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Length (L) = 25 feet
Width (W) = 14 feet
Depth (D) = 4 feet

Volume = L * W * D
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61920 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6192

The final answer is: $6192"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue sticks first. 

Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to 9. 

9 (red sticks) + 5 = 14 (blue sticks)

Now, we know there are 14 blue sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from 14.

14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 (yellow sticks)

Now, we have the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks. To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of sticks of each color together.

9 (red sticks) + 14 (blue sticks) + 11 (yellow sticks) = 34

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how far Matteo traveled, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find out how far Shandy traveled, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances. 
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. 
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 years old. 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Now, we can find the number of female students under 16 years old. 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old. 
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity each hour.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means it loses 5 * 9 = 45% of its capacity. So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%.

Now, in the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means it loses 3 * 7 = 21% of its capacity. So, the charge remaining after 3 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%.

Since the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:

100% - (45% + 21%) = 28%

Simplifying the equation, we get:
100% - 66% = 28%
34% = 28%

Now, let's solve for the initial charge:
100% - 34% = 66%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 66%.

Final answer: 66"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage.

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide the total hours by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate how much money he has left after buying the fruits he already purchased.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, we get $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. This means he actually spent more money than he had.

Since he can't spend more money than he has, we need to recalculate the total cost of the fruits he bought.

Let's recalculate the total cost of the fruits he bought:
3 peaches at $0.5 each = $1.5
4 pears at $0.75 each = $3
2 kiwis at $1 each = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each = $3.75
Total cost = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10

Since Jamaar has $10 and the total cost of the fruits he bought is also $10, he actually has no money left to buy plums.

The answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she kept is 2 * 60 = 120.

Since Anne gave the rest to her 10 friends, we need to subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces. The total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

Now, subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces: 900 - 120 = 780.

To find out how many pieces each of her friends received, we need to divide the total number of pieces given to her friends by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price. 
5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means she put 9 pictures in each album. 

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies. 

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits. 

2 x 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

27

"To find out how long James spent reading, we need to first find out how many sets of 3 pages he read. 

James read 18 pages, and since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he read. 

18 ÷ 3 = 6

Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes. 

6 * 10 = 60

So, James spent 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The hotel initially had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests left is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests left is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.
5. The number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, so he picked 3 x 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add them together: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many easy questions Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate 75% of 40% of the total questions.

40% of 60 questions = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, we multiply 24 by 0.75.

24 * 0.75 = 18

Now, let's find out how many average and difficult questions there are. Since the rest of the questions (60 - 40 = 20) are equally divided as average and difficult questions, there are 10 average and 10 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 5 questions from each category.

So, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 (easy) + 5 (average) + 5 (difficult) = 28 questions.

The final answer is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = 12 dollars.

Now, let's say Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals and 'l' large stuffed animals. We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so s = 2l.

We also know that she earned $120 from the sales. The total amount she earned is the sum of the amount earned from selling small stuffed animals and large stuffed animals. So, we can set up the equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Now, let's solve for l:

l = 120 / 20
l = 6

Since s = 2l, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

s = 2 * 6
s = 12

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 
So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply 11 sandwiches per day by 7 days in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 x $1 = $80 from cookies.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 x $4 = $240 from cupcakes.
Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them 2 x $10 = $20.
Now, we subtract the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 60 were found by the Smith twins, so 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

However, 10 eggs were not found. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe.
He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 
50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. 
So, one dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we multiply the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe by 40 dwarves and 30 days:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

The final answer is 43,200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich ($1.50) by the number of sandwiches in the third package (8) to find the total price: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first find out how much he still owes for the bedroom set after selling his old bedroom.

Tom bought the bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old bedroom for $1000. So, he has $3000 - $1000 = $2000 left to pay for the bedroom set.

Now, he has to pay 10% of $2000 per month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons

   Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons

   Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6

3. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons

   Total balloons = 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we multiply 75 by 2 to find out how many medium beans he can eat. 

75 * 2 = 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, we divide 150 by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat.

150 / 3 = 50

The final answer is 50."

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the space between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year, so the total amount of money he lost is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
He had a $25,000 a year job before college, and his college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years, the total amount of money he earned is:
$75,000 * 4 = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he needs to pay back the loans and the money lost while in school:
$200,000 (lost money) + $200,000 (loans) = $400,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$400,000 / $75,000 = 5.33 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 5.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric separately and then add them together.

The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

The area of the first piece of fabric is 8 x 10 = 80 square feet.
The area of the second piece of fabric is 8 x 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to add the areas together: 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209.

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to first find out how much he won and lost in each race.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. He lost $5, so twice that is $10. $1 more than $10 is $11. So, he won $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11, so 1.5 times $11 is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 in the third race.

To find the total amount he lost, we need to add the amounts he lost in each race. $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

To find the average amount he lost, we need to divide the total amount he lost by the number of races. There were 3 races, so we divide $21.50 by 3. $21.50 ÷ 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, let's find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find out how much money each person took.

Let's say the first person took x dollars.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So the first person took $420.

"To find the total hours of work, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team. 

First, we need to find the total number of days worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we need to find 3/8ths of 21 days. 

3/8 * 21 = 7.875 days

Now, we need to convert the fraction of a day into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 7.875 by 24.

7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter.

189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x.

Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set, the number of balls in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

9,876.27"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the number of books written in English and German.

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

1955 - 325 = 1630

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train. So, the total number of people is now 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people is now 140 + 100 = 240.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train. So, the total number of people is now 240 - 80 = 160.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles needed. 

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

To cover 200 square feet, we need 200 tiles. 

The cost of each tile is $12. 

So, the total cost will be 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the cost of the insurance with the accident, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72.

Now, we add the 60% increase to the normal cost: $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this for a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: 2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
So, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 x 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add them together: 
100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250 stickers.

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can subtract 3 from 10 to find out how many slices Jake ate. 
10 - 3 = 7

Now, we know Jake ate 7 slices. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply 7 by 2 to find out how many slices Silvia ate.
7 * 2 = 14

Now, we know Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices together.
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, we can calculate the cost as follows:
$300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the total cost of the painkillers is:
$4/pill * 30 pills = $120

The cost of the parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, so:
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's add up the costs:
$150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he doesn't need to respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails. 

Now, we subtract the emails he doesn't need to respond to from the total number of emails: 
80 - 16 = 64

James responds to 64 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 x 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 x 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

So, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

247"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, let's divide the total by the number of tests: 
380 ÷ 4 = 95

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of 40 pizzas. 
80% of 40 is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the pizzas eaten by both groups: 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. So, the number of big coupons is 2 x 700 = 1400.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 x 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 x 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 
26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   7 - 4 = 3

So, 3 meatball sub sandwiches remained.

3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   3 + 3 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many meatballs were in the 6 sub sandwiches that remained. 
Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver fertiliser, we need to find a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to multiply the number of dozen croissants he needs by the amount of butter he uses per dozen. 

6 dozen croissants * 1 pound per dozen = 6 pounds of butter

Since the grocery store has a promotion, Dennis will get 1 pound of butter for free and pay for 3 pounds. 

The cost of 3 pounds of butter is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. 
Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 
Number of guests = 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 
Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests. 
Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the total cost. 
Total cost = $125 (for 20 guests) + $6 * 21 (for additional guests) 
Total cost = $125 + $126 
Total cost = $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = 120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of 60. To find 1/4 of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.25. 
60 * 0.25 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of 60. To find 1/3 of 60, we multiply 60 by 1/3 or divide 60 by 3.
60 / 3 = 20

Now, we subtract the money they spent from the total amount of money they had.
Maggie had 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.
Riza had 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.

The total amount of money they have left is 45 + 40 = 85 dollars.

The final answer is 85."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to first find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas per day, the remaining bananas for the third monkey per day is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."

The final answer is 750."
"To find out how many quarters Jenny has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. She bought 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. So, the total cost is 15 x $2 = $30.

Since she bought a dozen roses for $15, she bought 15 - 12 = 3 extra roses for $2 each. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money she has. She has 5 x $5 = $25. So, she has $25 - $21 = $4 left.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the remaining $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we divide $4 by 4. $4 ÷ 4 = 1.

The final answer is 1."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far (120) from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we need to divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we need to divide 2000 by 0.75 to get the original price. 

Original price = 2000 / 0.75
Original price = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 

Selling price = 1.2 * 2666.67
Selling price = 3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount = (Original price - Selling price) / Original price
Discount = (2666.67 - 3200) / 2666.67
Discount = -533.33 / 2666.67
Discount = 0.2
Discount percentage = 20%

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can multiply the number of seconds in 4 hours by 1.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 24 hours in a day. So, there are 60 * 60 * 24 = 86,400 seconds in 4 hours.

Now, we multiply the number of seconds in 4 hours by 1 jellyfish per second: 86,400 * 1 = 86,400 jellyfish.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5: 86,400 * 5 = 432,000 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 432,000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 x 90 = 180.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles per hour, we can divide the distance (4 miles) by his speed (4 miles per hour) to get the time.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked to the store and then back home, we need to double the time it took him to walk to the store.

Total time = 2 x 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of each banana is $0.80, so the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. So, the total cost of buying 10 bunches is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

Now, to find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract the amount of fence he gets from the total amount of fence. 
100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the answer, we need to first find the rate of growth per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. 
So, the rate of growth per year is 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we need to find how many inches it will grow in 13 years. 
The crocodile grows 2 inches per year, so in 13 years, it will grow 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type.

First, we know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes sold in total, half of them would be 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. 
15% of 300 = 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB. Since we have already accounted for 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes, we subtract these from the total number of bikes sold to find the number of MTB bikes sold.
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings. 
- The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 MTB bikes would be 105 * 500 = $52,500.
- The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it's $250. 45 BMX bikes would be 45 * 250 = $11,250.
- The price of a Trekking bike is $450. 150 Trekking bikes would be 150 * 450 = $67,500.

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings.
$52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 5 * 240 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1200 minutes is (1/16) * 1200 = 75 minutes.

So, the total minutes John spends in class per week is 1200 + 75 = 1275 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

1275 minutes / 60 = 21.25 hours.

The final answer is 21.25."

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so the height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the ball on its second bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its height after the first bounce, so the height of the ball on its second bounce is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. 
   Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 
   6 feet = 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
   So, the second child's height = 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   So, the third child's height = 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
   So, the fourth child's height = 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how many bags of apples were sold, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.

To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to multiply the number of bags sold (200) by the price per bag ($5).

200 x $5 = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 200 bags of apples."
"To find the original amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Since the velociraptors ate half of it, they ate x/2 kilograms. 

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so x - x/2 = 270. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x/2 = 270. 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 540.

So, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. Since they ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

The original amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 + 540 = 1620 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1620"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of them has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of them has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda, we need to calculate the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 12 - 3 - 1 = 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 3 shaken sodas and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The total number of sodas left is 3 shaken + 6 unshaken = 9 sodas.

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 3/9 = 1/3.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to first find out how many days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31. 

20% of 31 is 0.2 x 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

Billy is available to help 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day. 

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available by the number of people he can help per day. 

25 days x 6 people per day = 150 people.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

So, there were 480 people inside the church.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the information given:

1. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. 
   So, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

2. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. 
   So, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The answer is 2."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes per day. 
Bobby's breaks are 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes per day.

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on his lunch and breaks.

Since there are 5 days, we multiply the time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount she returned: $15.00
2. Subtract the returned amount from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Calculate the discount on the frying pan: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   The sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Calculate the discount on the towels: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   The sale price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and these are the large jellyfish that change color. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age. 
Ben's age = 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. 
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age = 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren lives on 40% of her current salary, she saves 60% of her salary. 
60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to find out how much Lauren needs to save in total for 20 years. 
$20,000 per year * 20 years = $400,000.

Since Lauren saves $60,000 per year, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save ($400,000) by the amount she saves per year ($60,000) to find out how many years it will take her to save the required amount.
$400,000 / $60,000 = 6.67 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for approximately 6.67 years to save enough for her retirement period."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by 4 to find the length of each of the initial cuts. 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

2. Then, we divide the length of each initial cut (25 cm) by 5 to find the length of each final cut.
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 heels in total (3 of 4 inches and 3 of 2 inches).

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of heels: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract that from the total miles per day she needs to hike.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

185"

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she actually spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys the first 4 workers produce in 10 hours.

2 workers produce 6 toys per hour, so they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
2 workers produce 4 toys per hour, so they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour.

In total, the first 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys in 10 hours, we can assume that the fifth worker produces 0 toys in 10 hours.

However, we know that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

We already know that the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour. So, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 20 = 360 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide 360 by 10, which is 36.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

We also know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can set up the equation:

Arnold + Madeline + Camden + Sarah = 56

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's say they each painted y eggs. So, the equation becomes:

y + y + (x + 12) + x = 56

Combine like terms:

2y + 2x + 12 = 56

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2y + 2x = 44

Divide both sides by 2:

y + x = 22

Now, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. We can set up another equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find y:

y + x = 22
y + 9 = 22
y = 13

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many eggs Camden painted:

Camden = x + 12
Camden = 9 + 12
Camden = 21

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:

Camden - Arnold = 21 - 13
Camden - Arnold = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with crayons. 

Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8. 
200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by 8 ounces.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the weight in pounds.
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time she spent on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can divide 40 minutes by 2 to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. 

40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes per mile

Now, we know it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, we multiply 20 minutes by 2.

20 minutes * 2 = 40 minutes

Now, we know it takes Grandma 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach. We also know that she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes per mile on the sidewalk

Now, we know it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, we don't need to multiply.

Now, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time.

40 minutes (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 60 minutes

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8 to get the total amount she has saved so far: 
4 * 8 = 32

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save ($60) to find out how much more she needs to save:
60 - 32 = 28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take:
28 ÷ 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 
   60 - 24 = 36

2. Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles initially, we need to subtract 10 marbles from this number to find out how many marbles he will have after losing 10.
   36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much water Donny has in the second mug. 

Donny has 2 mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and he pours 4 ounces from it. So, the amount of water left in the 33-degree mug is 2 - 4 = 2 ounces.

Since he can drink the water after pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the second mug must have 2 ounces of water. 

Now, let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 1 ounce from it, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

We know that 1 ounce of the 33-degree water is 33 degrees, and 1 ounce of the x-degree water is x degrees. The average temperature of the water Donny has is 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 = 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

33 * 4 + x = 200

Multiply 33 by 4:

132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the second mug is at least 68 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 9 bagels in each pack. So, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

The total cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that 3 scoops of mashed potatoes require 6 potatoes. 

So, 18 scoops of mashed potatoes will require 18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. 
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree and then multiply that by the number of years in a decade.

Number of trees: 5
Number of lemons per tree: 6
Number of years in a decade: 10

First, multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree: 
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, multiply the number of lemons per year by the number of years in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.

"To find the number of women on the bus, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total number of parts is 5 + 9 = 14.

We know that the total number of passengers is 84. To find the value of 1 part, we divide 84 by 14. 

84 ÷ 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts for women, which is 9.

9 * 6 = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially. 

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total amount of money he makes from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide $100 by $5.

$100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam makes from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 x 20 = 12 rocks.

Adam sells 12 rocks for $7 each. So, the total amount of money he makes is 12 x $7 = $84.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Adam loses. He spent $100 on the rocks and made $84 from selling them. To find the loss, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent.

$100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16.

"To find the probability of both tickets being winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person collected first.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

27 - 5 = 22

Now, we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide 22 by 2.

22 ÷ 2 = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide them equally between themselves. There are 3 people, so we can divide the total number of seashells by 3.

Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats 4 x 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 days, so he eats 5 x 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

The first song is 5 minutes, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes.

Now, we add the length of both songs together: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 x $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need to multiply 2300 by 20% (or 0.2).

2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce. We know that Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. 

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs, we subtract the number of bottles needed from the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing a bow.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them are dressed in purple, so 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are dressed in purple.
1/4 of them are dressed in blue, so 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Now, 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.

To find the total number of babies wearing bows, we add the number of blue wearers (2) and the number of purple wearers wearing bows (2). 
2 + 2 = 4 babies wearing bows.

Now, to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple bow wearers (2) by the total number of bow wearers (4) and multiply by 100.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he had 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from selling 40 square meters.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. So, he earned $30 from selling 20 square meters.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 x $3 = $60 from selling the remaining land.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y. 
Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Blue rope length = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

Now, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. To find out how much she has left, we need to multiply 15 by 4/5. 

15 x 4/5 = 12

So, Rissa is left with $12.

The question asks how much is left in Ronnie's money. Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $7.50.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the other three colors. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the total amount of paint used (12 pints) by 3 to find the amount of paint used for each color.

12 pints / 3 = 4 pints per color

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is half of 12 pints, which is 6 pints.

Now, we know that the other half of the mural (6 pints) is divided among the three colors (red, white, and purple). Since each color has an equal amount, we can divide 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of paint used for each color.

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints per color

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with 120 pods for $1. 

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with 120 pods. 

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide 1 by the cost of one pod.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Remaining chalk = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can divide the remaining chalk by 0.2 to find the number of days:

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days.

The teacher will have 13 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first find the number of students on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = 1/4 * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Total number of students in the class = 12 + 12 = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first find out how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. Thrice as many as Mike is 3 times 5, which is 15. 2 more than 15 is 15 + 2 = 17.

The answer is 17."
"To find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus got a refund for the returned milk, we need to calculate the total cost of the returned milk.

Cost of 1600 gallons of milk = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27,000) by the number of schools (3) and then divide the result by the cost of one book ($500).

First, let's divide the total amount of money by the number of schools:
$27,000 ÷ 3 = $9,000

Now, let's divide the result by the cost of one book:
$9,000 ÷ $500 = 18

So, Bob can buy 18 books per school.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Newton started with 2 apples.
2. He picked up 1 apple and put it in his pocket, leaving 1 apple in the tree.
3. He picked up 5 more apples from the tree, put 4 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree. So now he has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple in the tree.
4. He picked up the remaining 5 apples from the tree, put 4 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree. So now he has 9 apples in his pocket and 2 apples in the tree.
5. He picked up the remaining 2 apples from the tree and went home.

So, Newton brought home 9 apples."
"To find the total cost of the coal, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find out how many bags Ali ordered.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate. 

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
So, the total number of slices each friend ate is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, we need to divide 60 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. 
60 / 12 = 5

Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide 60 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs. 
60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay can build in a certain amount of time, considering the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in an hour. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 60 by 15 to get 4 intervals. 

Now, we need to subtract the number of snowballs that melt in those 4 intervals. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 4 intervals, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

So, Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 of them melt. This means he has 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs left after 1 hour.

Since Jay wants 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many more snowballs he needs to build. He already has 12, so he needs 60 - 12 = 48 more snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 48 snowballs. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, we divide 48 by 20 to get 2.4 hours.

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Jay 3 hours to build 48 snowballs.

The answer is: 3"
"To find Jim's age, we need to know how old John was when Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim back then, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at that time was x. Then John's age would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation: 2x + (number of years since Digimon came out) = 28

Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, we can substitute that in: 2x + 20 = 28

Now, let's solve for x: 
2x = 28 - 20
2x = 8
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. 

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed: 4 + 20 = 24

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

So, they ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the initial number of bandages is x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had x + 84 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation: x = 78 - 59.

x = 19

The initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 19.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to subtract the length of her hair from the original length. 

Original length: 10 inches
Current length: 8 inches
Length cut: 10 - 8 = 2 inches

Since the haircut costs $30 per inch, we multiply the length cut by the cost per inch.

Cost of haircut: 2 inches * $30/inch = $60

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color.

Total cost: $60 + $40 = $100

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

He also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since he bought 25 red pens, he bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens Alain has: 25 (red pens) + 50 (black pens) = 75 pens.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide $600 by 10 bottles.

$600 ÷ 10 bottles = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30. So, the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. He bought 10 bottles of scotch, so he bought 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles x $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac. $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60 trees.
The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the height of the first floor: 
   Since the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, we multiply his height by 3.
   60 inches * 3 = 180 inches

2. Then, we find the height of the house: 
   Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, we multiply his height by 7.
   60 inches * 7 = 420 inches

3. Now, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor:
   420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

4. Since we want the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we need to add the height of the second floor to itself (because the roof is above the second floor).

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount of $300. 
2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in 11 months from the total amount he owes. 
$306 (total amount owed) - $275 (amount paid in 11 months) = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar first. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (the jar) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = Volume / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

However, the problem states that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number of red jelly beans from the true number.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 202.5
Difference = 697.5

The final answer is: 697.5"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of people on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 * $2 = $4. So, the total cost for 3 years is:
3 years * $4/year = $12

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $12 = $22

The final answer is: $22"
"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 10 students in each grade.

There are 3 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 3 x 10 = 30 students.

Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.

30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups of 8 students each. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, the total time for 3 full groups is:

3 groups x 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group. Since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done, they will have to wait for 45 minutes.

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

135 minutes (for the 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the items.

The cost of 4 wooden tables is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5. 

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to first find out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. 

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find out how many pounds of meat he needs: 
80 / 16 = 5 pounds

Now, we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply 5 by 2 to find out how much seasoning he needs:
5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

5 windows * 35 inches = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first find twice the amount of rain on Monday. 

Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 x 2 = 4 inches.

Since it's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, we add 1 inch to 4 inches. 

4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The total amount of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is x.
2. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.
3. Since each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.
4. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.
5. Now, let's solve the equation: x + 3x - 2 = 10
   Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10
   Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12
   Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first. 

The manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. If Karen gets both, the total cost would be $35 + $40 = $75.

Since Karen wants to get nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail. So, the total cost of nail art would be 10 * $3 = $30.

Now, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. The total cost is $75, so the discount would be 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The final cost would be the total cost minus the discount, which is $75 - $15 = $60. Adding the cost of nail art, the final cost would be $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues she receives.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 x 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

Let's start with the information that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total.

Shelley's paintings = Samantha's paintings + 12
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now, we know that Shelley has 39 paintings. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find out how many paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's total.

Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

The final answer is 31."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

The initial price in November was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. 
So, the price in December = $40 + (80% of $40) 
= $40 + (0.8 * $40) 
= $40 + $32 
= $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. 
So, the price in January = $72 - (50% of $72) 
= $72 - (0.5 * $72) 
= $72 - $36 
= $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie earns:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie earns:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, we need to find 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Now, we subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, we multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of scores.

Let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores. To find the mean, we divide the total by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. 

Since Eve had 1/4 of the pomelos left, we can set up an equation: 
1/4 * 20 = 5

This means Eve had 5 pomelos left. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she had left from the original number of pomelos. 
20 - 5 = 15

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
   2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. 
   So, he ate 24 apples and has 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

2. Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 
   25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. 
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples and has 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

3. He sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 
   He has 27 apples left, so he sold 27 apples at $3 each. 
   The total money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is 81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters is the same as 3/4.

9 * 4 = 36

So, Regina has written 36 novels this year.

36"
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he traveled for 3 days, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply the average speed (50 km/hr) by the total hours traveled (72 hours):

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow the steps:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 x 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used for the pies is 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.
5. The total grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since the total grapes used is 84, and there were 84 grapes at the beginning, the answer is 84."

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he buys 1 box per week. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00. 
So, the total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we need to divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since a middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold.

Each bookcase can hold 45 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide 110 by 45.

110 ÷ 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find the total number of eggs, we need to multiply the number of dozens by 12. 

5 dozens = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Rose bought 60 eggs for $2.40. To find the cost per egg, we divide the cost by the number of eggs.

Cost per egg = $2.40 / 60 eggs = $0.04 per egg

Rose will sell each egg for $1. To find the total revenue, we multiply the selling price by the number of eggs.

Total revenue = $1 * 60 eggs = $60

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Cost

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of strawberry cubes. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. 

We can write this as an equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He found one more marble that wasn't a marble, so he got rid of it. This means he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: First, we need to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we divide 15 by 1.5 (since 2 customers result in 1 car sold). 
15 / 1.5 = 10 customers

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 10 customers. Since for every 25 calls, 1 customer comes in, we divide 10 by 0.4 (since 25 calls result in 1 customer). 
10 / 0.4 = 25

So, Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of candle and the number of flashlights.

First, let's find the number of rooms with small candles and the number of rooms with medium candles. 
There are 8 rooms in total, so half of them will have small candles and the other half will have medium candles. 
So, 8 / 2 = 4 rooms have small candles and 4 rooms have medium candles.

Now, let's calculate the number of candles:
- Small candles: 4 rooms * 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles
- Medium candles: 4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles

Now, let's calculate the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights.

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights:
- Total candles: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles
- Total flashlights: 4 flashlights

So, Brianna's family is using 36 candles and 4 flashlights when the lights go out."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. 

There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110 chips.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Phineas needs to cover. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Since half of the distance is on land, Phineas will need to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land. To cover 100 yards, it will take him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in water. To cover 100 yards, it will take him 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts of the journey are independent, we add the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in water. So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply 10 dozen by 30 days.

10 dozen = 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts per day
120 doughnuts per day x 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut.

3600 doughnuts x $2 per doughnut = $7200

Derrick makes $7200 in June."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

So, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos.

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The answer is 12."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break it down day by day.

Day 1: 50 people
Day 2: 50 + 20 = 70 people
Day 3: 70 * 2 = 140 people

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, and there are 5 days left, we multiply 60 by 5 to find the total number of people for those days:
60 * 5 = 300 people

Now, we add up the people from all the days:
50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460 people

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460.

The final answer is: 460"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels popped from the residual heat. 
A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total number of kernels that popped: 
200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to find out how many gallons of lemonade he needs to make. He needs 4 gallons of lemonade, and he also wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart. So, he needs 4 + 1 = 5 gallons of lemonade.

Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 1 cup of lemon juice is made from 6 lemons, we need to multiply the number of gallons by 6 to find the total number of lemons needed.

5 gallons * 6 lemons per gallon = 30 lemons

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed, we need to calculate the amount of food each dog eats in a week.

A German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms per day, so in a week (7 days), it will eat 5 * 7 = 35 kilograms.

A Bulldog eats 3 kilograms per day, so in a week (7 days), it will eat 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms.

The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs, so the total amount of food needed is 35 + 21 = 56 kilograms.

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs belongs to one animal, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first find the total number of blue and yellow blocks.

We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total to find the number of red blocks.

32 - 12 = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed x Time = 18 x 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed x Time = 18 x 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the total distance from his house. Total distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial price = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial price = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

We know there are 54 red candies. 
There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.
There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights. 

Cost of one night at the hotel = $80
Number of nights = 3
Total cost of hotel = 80 * 3 = $240

Now, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. 
Cost of one bus trip = 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel
Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 * 80 = $8

Now, we need to find the total cost of the bus trips. 
Number of bus trips = 7
Total cost of bus trips = 8 * 7 = $56

Now, we need to find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels. 
Total cost = Total cost of hotel + Total cost of bus trips
Total cost = 240 + 56 = $296

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4 of them. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping, he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla got.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12.
The cost of the child ticket is $8.
There are 2 children, so the total cost of the child tickets is 2 x $8 = $16.
The cost of the 2 popcorns is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$12 (adult ticket) + $16 (child tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $34

The family pays a total of $34."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)

In this case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours. 

Then, we add 2 hours to that result, which is 5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 days = 40 pounds of feed per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds of feed per week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The answer is 20."
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. 

He invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we need to subtract those from the total. 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide 36 by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 36 / 6 = 6.

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack. 6 * 2 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's calculate her total income:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, we can multiply 12 by 2 to find the older brother's age. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now we know the older brother is 24 years old. 

Since all the sisters are the same age, and they are 16 years old, we can multiply 16 by 3 to find the total age of the sisters. 

16 * 3 = 48

Now we add the ages of the brothers and sisters together. 

24 (older brother) + 12 (younger brother) + 48 (sisters) = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so she meditates for 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so she practices yoga for 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she meditates for 210 * 4 = 840 minutes and practices yoga for 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time she spent on meditation and yoga is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. 
The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
So, the price of 2 T-shirts is 2 x $8 = $16. 
Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 
The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. 
So, the price of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. 
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. 
So, the price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's find the total cost of making 10 jars: 
Total cost of 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440

To find the total revenue from selling 10 jars, we multiply the selling price by the number of jars:
Total revenue from selling 10 jars: $50 * 10 = $500

Now, let's find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - $440

"Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many holes Nate's dog dug in 14 days. 

Since Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day, in 14 days, the dog will dig 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in 84 holes, we need to divide 84 by 9. 

84 / 9 = 9.33 days.

However, Nate's dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, we need to add the number of nights to the total days. Since there are 7 nights in a week, we can divide 9.33 by 7 to find out how many weeks it will take Nate to fill in the holes.

9.33 / 7 = 1.33 weeks.

Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we can round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, it will take Nate approximately 2 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average.

To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of test tubes Igor gathered is x. Since he gathered half as many test tubes as requested, the number of test tubes he gathered is x = 16 / 2 = 8.

The number of Petri dishes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16.

The number of beakers he gathered is 7.

The total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29. We can write an equation to represent this:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) - (number of beakers lost) = 29

Let's simplify the equation:

8 + 16 + 7 - (number of beakers lost) = 29

Combine the constants:
31 - (number of beakers lost) = 29

Subtract 31 from both sides:
-number of beakers lost = -2

Multiply both sides by -1:
number of beakers lost = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (which is twice as many as the first basket). 

Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2. 

2 * 10 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together: 
10 + 20 = 30

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30.

30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add up the money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add up the money each person raised:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance (2 miles) in the same amount of time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he runs 2 miles, we can find his speed by dividing the time by the distance: 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so she runs 4 miles. To find the time it takes her to run 4 miles, we multiply her speed by the distance: 8 minutes per mile * 4 miles = 32 minutes.

The final answer is 32."
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the number of feet of dock by 3. 

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we need to subtract that from the total.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount they make in a day and then multiply it by 2.

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals that cost $5 each, so the meals cost 2 x $5 = $10 per reservation. They also get a $5 bottle of wine per reservation. So, the total amount they make per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make per night is 6 x $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make in a week is 2 x $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

To find the cost of one watermelon, we divide the total cost by 50:
$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we multiply the cost by 1.25 (100% + 25% profit):
$1.60 × 1.25 = $2

So, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person peels in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she will peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she will peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels. 

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320. 

So, Mark paid $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hired a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

3 hours x $50 per hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is: $470"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the equation: 
2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4). 

56 ÷ 4 = 14

So, each person can have 14 slices."
