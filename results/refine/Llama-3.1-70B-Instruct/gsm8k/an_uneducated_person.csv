"I reckon Janet's got a lot of eggs from her ducks. She gets 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 for breakfast, and she uses 4 to make muffins for her friends. That's 7 eggs she don't sell. So she's got 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells 'em for 2 bucks each. So she makes 9 x 2 = 18 bucks a day.

"I reckon makin' a robe takes some fiber. It says it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and half that much white fiber. So, for the white fiber, that's 2 divided by 2, which is 1 bolt.

Now, I add 'em together: 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white. That's 3 bolts in total.

"So Josh buys a house for 80,000 bucks and puts in 50,000 for repairs. That's a total of 130,000. Now, the repairs made the house worth 150% more. I think that means it's now worth 2.5 times the original price. So, 2.5 times 80,000 is 200,000.

Now, let's see how much profit he made. He sold it for 200,000 and spent 130,000. So, his profit is 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.

70,000"
"So James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. That's 3 x 3, which is 9 sprints a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. So if he runs 9 sprints, that's 9 x 60. I gotta do the math... 9 x 60 is 540. 

540"
"I reckon Wendi's got a lot of chickens to feed. She's got 20 chickens, and each one needs 3 cups of feed a day. That's a lotta feed. So, I'ma multiply 20 chickens by 3 cups, and that's 60 cups of feed.

Now, I know she already gave 'em some feed in the mornin' and the afternoon. She gave 'em 15 cups in the mornin' and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 40 cups right there.

So, I'ma subtract 40 from 60, and that's how much feed she needs to give 'em for the last meal. That's 20 cups.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Kylar's buyin' glasses, and they cost $5 each, but every other one's cheaper, like 60% cheaper. That means the second one's 60% of $5, which is... um... $3.

Now, Kylar wants 16 glasses. That's a lotta glasses. I'm gonna count 'em in pairs, 'cause that's how the discount works. So, 16 glasses is 8 pairs.

The first glass in each pair is $5, and the second one's $3. So, each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8. Now, I gotta multiply that by 8, 'cause there's 8 pairs. That's 8 x $8 = $64.

But wait, I gotta think about this some more. If every other glass is cheaper, that means the odd-numbered glasses are $5, and the even-numbered glasses are $3. Kylar's buyin' 16 glasses, so that's 8 odd-numbered glasses and 8 even-numbered glasses.

The odd-numbered glasses cost 8 x $5 = $40, and the even-numbered glasses cost 8 x $3 = $24. Now, I add those two numbers together: $40 + $24 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"I think I can figger this out. Seattle's got 20 sheep, right? Now, Charleston's got 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so that's 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Carla's downloadin' a big file, 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute, so that's pretty fast. But then her computer restarts and she loses all her progress. That's a bummer.

First, let's see how long it takes her to download 40% of the file. That's like, a big chunk. 40% of 200 GB is... um... 80 GB. And she can download 2 GB every minute, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then her computer restarts and she has to wait 20 minutes. That's a long time. After that, she has to start all over again. So she downloads the whole 200 GB file. That's 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

So, let's add it all up. 40 minutes for the first part, 20 minutes for the restart, and 100 minutes for the whole file. That's... 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"So John drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, that's 3 x 60 = 180 miles. Then he turned around and got stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he didn't move. Then he drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour, that's 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles. Then he drove the rest of the time, which is 1.5 hours, at 80 miles per hour, that's 80 x 1.5 = 120 miles. 

So in total, he drove 15 + 120 = 135 miles back. But he was 180 miles away, so now he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.

"I'm gonna break it down. Eliza gets 10 bucks an hour for the first 40 hours. That's 40 * 10 = 400 bucks. Now, she worked 5 more hours, that's overtime. She gets 1.2 times her regular pay, so that's 10 * 1.2 = 12 bucks an hour. For 5 hours, that's 5 * 12 = 60 bucks. Add that to her regular pay, 400 + 60 = 460 bucks.

460"
"Alright, let's break it down. 

First month, we got 60 downloads. That's a good start.

Second month, it's three times more than the first month. So, that's 3 x 60 = 180 downloads. That's a lot more.

Now, third month, it's 30% less than the second month. I think I can do that. 30% of 180 is... um... 0.3 x 180 = 54. So, we subtract that from 180, and we get 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

366"
"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Toula spent at the bakery. She got 3 dozen donuts, and they cost 68 bucks a dozen. So that's 3 times 68, which is... um... 204 bucks. Then she got 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and they cost 80 bucks a dozen. That's 2 times 80, which is... 160 bucks. And she got 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and they cost 55 bucks a dozen. That's 6 times 55, which is... 330 bucks.

Now, I'm gonna add all them numbers together: 204 + 160 + 330. That's... 694 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Carlos is plantin' a lemon tree, and it's gonna cost him $90 to plant it. Then every year, the tree's gonna grow 7 lemons, and he can sell 'em for $1.5 each. But he's also gotta pay $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

Let's see... if he sells 7 lemons for $1.5 each, that's 7 x $1.5 = $10.5. But he's gotta pay $3 to take care of the tree, so he's really only gettin' $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Now, he's gotta pay $90 to plant the tree, so we gotta figger out how many years it's gonna take him to make that back. If he's makin' $7.5 per year, we can divide $90 by $7.5 to get... um... *counts on fingers* ...12 years.

So it's gonna take Carlos 12 years to start earnin' money on the lemon tree.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Melanie's got some vacuum cleaners, and she sells some. She sells a third of 'em at the green house. That means if she had 3, she'd sell 1. If she had 6, she'd sell 2. And so on.

Then she sells 2 more at the red house. That's just 2.

After that, she's got some left, and she sells half of those at the orange house. If she had 4 left, she'd sell 2. If she had 6 left, she'd sell 3.

Now, we know she's got 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we gotta work backwards. If she sold half at the orange house, that means she had 10 before that (5 x 2 = 10).

Before the orange house, she had 10, and before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12. And before the green house, she had 12 + a third of whatever she started with. Let's call that number x. So, a third of x is x/3.

We know 12 + x/3 = x. We can try some numbers. If x is 18, then x/3 is 6. And 12 + 6 is 18. That works!

"I think I can figger this out. So, we got 20 kids in a dance class. 20% of 'em do contemporary dance. That's like, 4 kids. Now we got 16 kids left. 25% of them do jazz dance, that's 4 kids too. So, we subtract 4 from 16, that's 12 kids left. They must be doin' hip-hop dance.

Now, to find the percentage, I think I gotta divide 12 by 20, then multiply by 100. That's like, 60%. So, 60% of the kids do hip-hop dance.

"I think I can help with that. So, the merchant got two choices: buy jewelry for $5,000 or gadgets for $8,000. Now, the prices might go up, and we wanna know which one will make more money.

For the jewelry, it might go up 2.5%. That's like, a little more than 2%. So, if we take 2.5% of $5,000, that's... um... $125.

For the gadgets, it might go up 1.2%. That's like, a little more than 1%. So, if we take 1.2% of $8,000, that's... um... $96.

So, the jewelry will make more money, $125. That's the best choice.

Profit: $125"
"I think I can figger this out. So we got two trains, and they both go 80 miles one way, then 150 miles the other way. To find out how far they went, we just add 'em together. 

80 miles one way, 150 miles the other way... that's 80 + 150. I think that's... 230 miles.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Jill makes in a year. She gets paid $20 an hour for teachin' and $30 an hour for bein' a cheerleadin' coach. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week teachin' and 15 hours a week coachin'.

First, let's see how much she makes teachin' in a week. That's 35 hours a week times $20 an hour, so that's... um... *counts on fingers* ...$700 a week. Now, if she does that for 50 weeks, that's... *counts on fingers again* ...$35,000 a year.

Now, let's see how much she makes coachin' in a week. That's 15 hours a week times $30 an hour, so that's... *counts on fingers* ...$450 a week. Now, if she does that for 50 weeks, that's... *counts on fingers again* ...$22,500 a year.

So, if we add 'em together, that's $35,000 plus $22,500, which is... *counts on fingers* ...$57,500.

$57,500"
"I reckon Claire eats a lotta eggs. She has 3 eggs every mornin', so that's 3 eggs a day. There's 7 days in a week, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 eggs a week. Now, if we multiply that by 4, that's 21 * 4 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Now, I know a dozen is 12, so I gotta figure out how many dozens is 84 eggs. I can do that by dividin' 84 by 12. That's... um... 84 / 12 = 7.

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

"I think I can figger this out. Marissa's tryin' to hike 12 miles, and she wants to do it at a pace of 4 miles per hour. She's already walked 6 miles, takin' 2 hours to do it. Now she's got 6 miles left, and she wants to know how fast she gotta go to finish in time.

First, I gotta figger out how much time she's got left. If she's gotta do 12 miles at 4 miles per hour, that's 3 hours total. She's already used up 2 hours, so she's got 1 hour left.

Now, she's got 6 miles to go, and she's gotta do it in 1 hour. That's like, 6 miles divided by 1 hour. I think that's... 6 miles per hour.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So we got 10 liters of orange drink, but we spill 1 liter, so we got 9 liters left. Now, I think I remember somethin' about fractions from school. Two-thirds of the orange drink is water, so that's like... if I had 3 cups of orange drink, 2 of 'em would be water. So for 9 liters, I gotta multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's 18 divided by 3, which is 6 liters of water in the orange drink.

Now, let's look at the pineapple drink. We got 15 liters of that, and it's three-fifths water. I think that means if I had 5 cups of pineapple drink, 3 of 'em would be water. So for 15 liters, I gotta multiply 15 by 3 and then divide by 5. That's 45 divided by 5, which is 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, I just add 'em together: 6 liters from the orange drink and 9 liters from the pineapple drink. That's 15 liters of water.

The final answer is: 15"
"I think I can figger this out. So Samantha's 31, and Raymond's 6 years older than her. That means Raymond's 31 + 6, which is 37. Now, I know Raymond had a kid when he was 23. So if he's 37 now, and he had his kid 14 years ago, that's when his kid was born.

"I think I can figger this out. So the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, right? And it's burnin' from 1 to 5, that's 4 hours. I remember learnin' about multiplication in school, so I'ma multiply 4 hours by 2 centimeters.

4 x 2 = 8

So the candle's gonna be 8 centimeters shorter.

The final answer is: 8"
"I think I can figure this out. So Kyle got a discount on a book, and he paid $19.50. The discount was 25% off the original price. That means he paid 75% of the original price. 

I remember my friend told me that to find the original price, I gotta divide the price Kyle paid by 0.75 (that's 75%). So I'll do that.

$19.50 ÷ 0.75 = $26

The final answer is: $26"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Marie spent $50 total. She got a chicken meal for $12, 5 milks for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. I gotta add all that up.

5 milks for $3 each is 5 x $3 = $15. 4 apples for $1.50 each is 4 x $1.50 = $6. Now I add all that up: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now I know she spent $50 total, so I subtract $33 from that: $50 - $33 = $17. That's how much she spent on pizza.

Each pizza is $8.50, so I divide $17 by $8.50 to see how many pizzas she got: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Mishka spent. 

She bought 3 shorts, 3 pants, and 3 shoes. Shorts cost 16.50 each, pants cost 22.50 each, and shoes cost 42 each.

So, 3 shorts is 3 x 16.50, that's 49.50. 3 pants is 3 x 22.50, that's 67.50. And 3 shoes is 3 x 42, that's 126.

"Cynthia eats ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she'll eat 60 servings. Them cartons got 15 servings in 'em, so she'll need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons. Each carton costs 4 bucks, so she'll spend 4 * 4 = 16 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. Henry rode his bike 60 miles. He stopped once at 20 miles, then he stopped again 15 miles before the end. So, if he stopped 15 miles before the end, that means he rode 60 - 15 = 45 miles before his second stop. Then, I subtract the 20 miles he rode before his first stop, so 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So Darrell and Allen's ages are like in a special number thingy, 7 to 11. That means if Darrell's age is 7 somethings, Allen's age is 11 somethings. Let's just call those somethings ""x"".

So if we add their ages together, we get 7x + 11x, and that's equal to 162. That's like, their total age now.

7x + 11x is like 18x, right? So we got 18x = 162.

Now, I think I can figure out what x is. If 18x is 162, then x is... um... 162 divided by 18. That's 9.

So now we know x is 9. That means Allen's age is 11 times 9, which is... 99.

But we need to know how old Allen's gonna be 10 years from now. So we just add 10 to 99, and that's... 109.

First friend says 80. 
Second friend says 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60. 
Third friend says 25% more than 80. I think that's like, 20 more, so that's 100.

Now we add 'em up: 80 + 60 + 100 is 240. 
Then we divide by 3, 'cause there's 3 friends. 240 divided by 3 is 80.

"I reckon John's got a lotta work takin' care of them dogs. He's got 10 dogs, and each one needs about half an hour a day to walk 'em and clean up after 'em. That's 10 dogs times half an hour, so that's 5 hours a day.

Now, if he's doin' that every day, that's 5 hours a day times 7 days a week. I think that's... *counts on fingers* ...35 hours a week.

"I think I can figger this out. So Gretchen's got 110 coins, and there's more gold than silver. Let's say she's got x silver coins. Then she's got x + 30 gold coins 'cause there's 30 more gold than silver.

So we add 'em together, and it's 110. That's like this: x + (x + 30) = 110. I think I can simplify that. That's like 2x + 30 = 110.

Now I subtract 30 from both sides, and that's 2x = 80. Then I divide both sides by 2, and that's x = 40. That's how many silver coins she's got.

Now I add 30 to that, and that's how many gold coins she's got. 40 + 30 is 70.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Raymond's got 40 jewels, and we need to find out how many Siobhan's got. 

First, we gotta find out how many Aaron's got. Aaron's got 5 more than half of what Raymond's got. Half of 40 is 20, so Aaron's got 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan's got 2 fewer than Aaron, so we gotta take 2 away from 25. That's 25 - 2 = 23.

It says he scored 25% more points. I think that means he scored a quarter more points. So, if he scored 4 points, a quarter of that is 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, I gotta add the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. That's 4 + 5 = 9 points.

Now, I gotta know how many sets of 4 yogurts he buys. That's 60 yogurts, divided by 4. That's 15 sets.

Each set costs 5 bucks, so I multiply 15 sets by 5 bucks. That's 75 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. John sold some lego sets for 15 bucks each. He had 13 of 'em. So he made 13 x 15 = 195 bucks. Then he bought some video games for 20 bucks each. He got 8 of 'em, so that's 8 x 20 = 160 bucks. He had 5 bucks left over. 

Now, if he made 195 bucks and only spent 165 bucks (160 on games and 5 left over), that means he didn't sell all his lego sets. He musta kept some. Let's see... 195 - 165 = 30 bucks. That's how much he didn't spend. Since each lego set is 15 bucks, he musta kept 30 / 15 = 2 lego sets.

"I think I can figger this out. So John runs 60 miles a week, and he does it in 3 days. He runs 3 hours the first day, and then half that the other two days. That's 1.5 hours the other two days.

So, he runs 3 hours one day, and 1.5 hours the other two days. That's 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours total.

Now, I think speed is like how far you go in a certain amount of time. So, if he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, that's like... 60 miles divided by 6 hours. That's 10 miles per hour.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Dana can run fast, walk slow, and skip. She skips at 3 miles per hour, but she runs twice as fast as that, so that's 6 miles per hour. And she walks, um, 4 times slower than she runs, so that's 6 divided by 4, which is 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, she's gonna run for 2 hours and walk for 4 hours. So when she's runnin', she's gonna go 6 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's 12 miles. And when she's walkin', she's gonna go 1.5 miles per hour for 4 hours, that's 6 miles.

So, if she runs 12 miles and walks 6 miles, that's a total of... 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Now, the dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet, so we gotta subtract that from how far Polly can throw. That's 1200 minus 1000, which is 200 feet.

"I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I'll try my best. So, you got a bag of chips and it says 250 calories per serving. You wanna know how many grams you can eat if you only got 200 calories left for the day.

First, I think we gotta figure out how many servings you can have with 200 calories. If one serving is 250 calories, you can't even have one whole serving, right? So, I'll just divide 200 by 250. That's like, 0.8 servings or something.

Now, the bag is 300g and it's got 5 servings. So, I'll divide 300 by 5 to find out how many grams are in one serving. That's 60g per serving. Then, I'll multiply 60g by 0.8 servings. That's... um... 48g.

If he makes 20 candles, he's gonna need 2 pounds of wax, 'cause 20 divided by 10 is 2. So, that's 2 times 10 bucks, which is 20 bucks for the wax and wicks.

Now, he's sellin' 20 candles at 2 bucks each, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 bucks.

To figure out how much he's makin', I subtract the cost from the money he's gettin'. That's 40 bucks minus 20 bucks, which is 20 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse, then she bought some more. She used 220 of 'em at work, and she had 23 left. I wanna know how many she bought.

Let's see... if she had 80 and she used 220, that's more than she had, so she musta bought some. If she had 23 left, that means she had 23 + 220 = 243 post-it notes after she bought some.

Now, we know she had 80 to start with, so if she had 243 after she bought some, that means she bought 243 - 80 = 163 post-it notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. That means he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Now, since he buys twice as many red ties, he musta bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

I know the red ties cost more than the blue ones, 50% more. That means they cost 1.5 times more. So a red tie costs 1.5 * 40 = $60.

He bought 10 red ties, so that's 10 * 60 = $600.

Add that to the $200 he spent on blue ties, and he spent 200 + 600 = $800.

"I ain't no math whiz, but I can figger this out. Tracy's got 4 feet of wire, and she's cuttin' it into 6-inch pieces. First, I gotta convert them feet to inches. I know there's 12 inches in a foot, so I multiply 4 by 12. That's 48 inches.

Now, I divide 48 by 6, 'cause that's how long each piece is. That's... um... 8. Yeah, that's right. Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, there's 15 floors in the buildin', and each floor got 8 units. That's a lotta units. To find out how many units there is in total, I'm gonna multiply 15 by 8. That's... um... 120 units.

Now, it says 3/4 of the buildin' is occupied. I think that means 3 out of every 4 units is taken. So, I'm gonna multiply 120 by 3, and then divide by 4. That's... 90 units that's occupied.

To find out how many units is unoccupied, I'm gonna subtract the number of occupied units from the total. That's 120 - 90... that's 30.

"I work on a farm, so I know a thing or two about eggs. Lloyd's chickens give him 252 eggs a day. Now, we gotta figure out how many dozens that is. See, a dozen is 12 eggs, so we divide 252 by 12. That's 21 dozen eggs a day. He sells 'em for 2 bucks a dozen, so that's 21 x 2, which is 42 bucks a day. Now, if we multiply that by 7, that's how much he makes in a week. 42 x 7 is 294.

"Uriah's got a heavy book bag, and he needs to take some stuff out. He's gotta get rid of 15 pounds. His comic books are pretty light, 1/4 pound each, and his toys are a bit heavier, 1/2 pound each. He took out 30 comic books, so that's 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds gone.

Now, he still needs to get rid of 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 more pounds. Since his toys are 1/2 pound each, we need to figure out how many toys make 7.5 pounds. I think it's like this: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

He needs to take out 15 toys."
"I'm a mechanic, so I know how much I charge for fixin' tires. For trucks, it's 60 bucks a tire, and for cars, it's 40 bucks a tire.

On Thursday, I fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So, for the trucks, that's 6 x 60 = 360 bucks. And for the cars, that's 4 x 40 = 160 bucks. Add 'em up, and I made 360 + 160 = 520 bucks on Thursday.

On Friday, I fixed 12 car tires, but no truck tires. So, that's 12 x 40 = 480 bucks.

Now, I gotta figure out which day I made more money. Thursday was 520 bucks, and Friday was 480 bucks. Thursday was the better day, so I need to find out how much more I made. That's 520 - 480 = 40 bucks.

"Alright, let's figger this out. We gotta find out how many boxes can go on the truck without breakin' the bridge. The bridge can hold 5000 pounds, and the truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds. So, we subtract the truck's weight from the bridge's limit: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. That's how much weight we got left for the boxes.

Now, each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes we can put on, we divide the leftover weight by the weight of each box: 1245 ÷ 15 = 83.

She worked 30 years, so that's 10 years after the 20-year mark. That's 10 years times 5% each year, so that's 50% of the pension. 

Now, 50% of 50,000 is half of that, so it's 25,000.

But wait, I made a mistake, it's actually 126 bucks a month, 'cause 140 - 14 is 126. So for the next 6 months, she pays 126 times 6, which is... um... 756 bucks.

Let's see... 100 miles divided by 4 gallons is... 25 miles per gallon. That's how far she can go on one gallon of gas. Now, if her tank holds 12 gallons, I can multiply 25 miles per gallon by 12 gallons. That's... 25 x 12 = 300 miles.

Now, each school got 2 coaches, one for each team. So that's 2 coaches per school times 4 schools. That's 8 coaches.

So, we add the players and coaches together. That's 40 players plus 8 coaches. That's 48 people.

Now, there were twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, we gotta multiply the number of rubies by 2. That's 140 x 2 = 280 emeralds.

Now, let's do the math. He's sellin' 12 marigolds at $3 each, that's 12 x $3 = $36. He's sellin' 9 petunias at $2 each, that's 9 x $2 = $18. He's sellin' 17 begonias at $2 each, that's 17 x $2 = $34.

Now, I gotta add all them up: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240. That's the total square feet of all the levels. But I need to find the average, so I gotta divide that by how many levels there are, which is 4. So, 240 / 4 = 60.

Now, 2/6 of 24 is like, um, 24 divided by 6 is 4, and then you multiply that by 2, 'cause there's two girls. So that's 4 x 2 = 8 liters of water for the girls.

Then the boy comes along and takes 6 liters of water. So now we gotta add the water the girls got and the water the boy got. That's 8 + 6 = 14 liters.

That's like, 2x + 8 = 22. Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can do some simple stuff. If I subtract 8 from both sides, I get 2x = 14. Then, if I divide both sides by 2, I get x = 7.

"Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 2/3 of that. I think that's like, 2 parts out of 3 parts, right? So if Harry slept 9 hours, that's like 3 parts. 2 parts out of 3 is 6 hours. That's how much James slept.

Now, I gotta figure out how many more hours Harry slept than James. That's just subtractin' the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept. 9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

"I think I can figger this out. So, when Freda cooks them tomatoes, they shrink down to half. She made 32 ounces of sauce, but that's half of what she started with, so she musta started with 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Now, them tomatoes come in 16-ounce cans, so I gotta divide 64 by 16 to see how many cans she used. That's 4 cans. And each can's got 3 tomatoes in it, so I multiply 4 by 3... that's 12 tomatoes.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got 30 cars on the motorway, right? Then 5 of 'em take an exit, so that leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars.

Now, we know 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the jam. So if we subtract those from the 25 cars that didn't take the exit, we get the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

25 - 20 = 5

Now, she's gonna give away 1 plant from each window ledge, so that's 40 plants she's givin' away. To find out how many she's got left, I'll subtract 40 from 98. That's 98 - 40 = 58.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Jerome's friends came over and they kept ringin' the doorbell. 

The first friend rang it 20 times. That's a lotta ringin'. 

The second friend rang it a bit more than the first one. They rang it 1/4 times more, which is like, 5 more times. So that's 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend rang it 60 times. That's a whole lotta ringin' too.

The third friend rang it 10 times more than the fourth friend. So that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add all them up: 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

4 + 20 is 24, then add 7, that's 31, and then add 8, that's 39. So, he's gotta read 39 pages in total. But he already read 15 pages on Monday, so we gotta take that away.

39 - 15 is 24. Now, he's gotta read 24 pages in 4 days. That's like, um, 24 divided by 4... that's 6.

Her mom comes along and puts a third of them on the board. A third of 750 is like... um... 250. Yeah, that's right.

So now we gotta add up all the pieces they put on the board. That's 250 from Poppy and 250 from her mom, which is 500.

So the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. To find the volume, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Now we got 3 boxes, so we multiply 24 by 3: 24 x 3 = 72.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Frankie watched some TV, and we gotta find out how many 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday.

He watched 1-hour shows on Monday and Tuesday, so that's 2 hours. Then on Thursday, he watched a 1-hour show and a 30-minute show, that's 1.5 hours. And on Friday, he watched 2 more 1-hour shows, that's 2 hours.

So, if we add all them hours up, we get 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. Now, we know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, so we subtract 5.5 from 7, and we get 1.5 hours.

Now, we gotta figger out how many 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. And if each show is 30 minutes, we divide 90 by 30, and we get 3.

Let's say he made x cookies last year. This year, he wanted to make 2x cookies. But he made 15 more, so that's 2x + 15. Then he dropped 5, so we gotta subtract 5 from that. So we got 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Now, I'm not so good at math, but I think I can do this. If we combine the 15 and the -5, that's like 10. So now we got 2x + 10 = 110.

If we subtract 10 from both sides, that's like takin' 10 away from both numbers. So we get 2x = 100.

Now, if we divide both sides by 2, that's like splitin' both numbers in half. So we get x = 50.

The final answer is: 50"

I think I can do that by seein' how many 16-second chunks fit into 64 seconds. That's like, 64 divided by 16, which is 4. So she rows 4 times as far as she did in 16 seconds. And we know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. So in 64 seconds, she rows 4 times 20 feet, which is 80 feet.

Now, I gotta figure out how many 10-foot chunks are in 80 feet. That's like, 80 divided by 10, which is 8. So she rows 8 chunks of 10 feet. And for each chunk, she takes on 2 liters of water. So she takes on 8 times 2 liters, which is 16 liters.

40% of $40,000 is $16,000, so Adrien makes $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000 now.

Now, let's figger out Lylah's salary. If Adrien's salary was 30% more than hers, that means his salary is 130% of hers. So, if we divide $40,000 by 1.3, we get Lylah's salary four years ago, which is around $30,769.

Now, Lylah's salary went up by 40% too. 40% of $30,769 is $12,308, so she makes $30,769 + $12,308 = $43,077 now.

Now, I know we harvest pineapples every 3 months, so that's 4 times a year. My buddy's got a calendar, and it says there's 12 months in a year. So, if we divide 12 by 3, that's 4 harvests.

So, if John's got 1000 pineapples per harvest, and he harvests 4 times a year, that's 1000 * 4 = 4000 pineapples per year.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Johnny's got 3 boxes of Legos. One's got 500 pieces. Another one's got 3 times more than that, so that's 3 x 500, which is 1500. Then there's this other one that's got a quarter of the pieces of the first one, so that's 500 / 4, which is 125.

Now, I'm gonna add 'em all up: 500 + 1500 + 125. That's a lotta Legos. Let me see... 500 + 1500 is 2000, and then I add 125, that's 2125.

"I'm just a regular fella, but I'll try my best to figure this out. So, Debra's watchin' them bees, right? 

First, 30 bees leave the hive. Then, half of 'em come back, which is 15. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still out.

Next, 60 more bees leave the hive. Now we got 15 bees that were already out, and 60 more that just left, so that's 15 + 60 = 75 bees that ain't in the hive.

Finally, all them 75 bees come back to the hive. That's how many bees Debra saw return in the last 6 hours.

"So Charlie's got 3 times more friends than Dorothy, and James got 4 times more friends than Dorothy. We know Charlie's got 12 friends. So if Charlie's got 3 times more friends than Dorothy, that means Dorothy's got 12 divided by 3 friends. That's 4 friends.

Now, James got 4 times more friends than Dorothy, and Dorothy's got 4 friends. So James got 4 times 4 friends. That's 16 friends.

"I'm pretty good at figuring stuff out. So Steve and Tim are racin' home from school. Steve's got a bike and lives 3 miles away, and Tim's got a skateboard and lives 2 miles away. 

First, we gotta figure out how many feet they gotta travel. I know there's 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's gotta go 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's gotta go 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we know Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, and Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute. So, Steve's time is 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes, and Tim's time is 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Steve's faster, so he's gonna win. Now, we just gotta figure out how long he's gonna be waitin' for Tim. That's 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"I'm pretty good with numbers, so I'll give it a shot. Shawnda's got a bike inflation thing goin' on, and she charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we gotta figure out how many tires she inflated. There were 5 people with bikes, and they got both tires done, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. Then there were 3 people with them tricycles, and they got all 3 tires done, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. And some dude came by on a unicycle, so that's 1 more tire.

So, we add 'em all up: 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Now, each tire costs 25 cents, so we multiply 20 x 25 = 500 cents. I think there's 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide 500 by 100, and that's 5 dollars.

"Carl got 10 packs of cookies, and each pack got 6 cookies. So he got 10 x 6 = 60 cookies. Each cookie cost 10 cents, so 60 cookies cost 60 x 10 cents = 600 cents. Since 100 cents is a dollar, 600 cents is 6 dollars.

Carl paid with a 10 dollar bill, so he gets 10 - 6 = 4 dollars back.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Dave ate 14 fries, and then a seagull ate half of that, which is 7. So now we got 14 + 7 = 21 fries gone.

Then 3 pigeons came and each ate 3 fries, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 more fries gone. Now we got 21 + 9 = 30 fries gone.

After that, a raccoon took 2/3 of what was left. I don't know what that means, but I can try to work with it. Let's say there was x fries to start with. Then we subtract the 30 that's gone, so we got x - 30 left.

The raccoon took 2/3 of that, so we gotta figger out what's left. I think that means we multiply x - 30 by 1/3, 'cause that's the part that's left. So we got 1/3 * (x - 30) left.

Then some ants took 1 fry, and we got 5 left. So we can set up an equation: 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1. I think that's right.

Now I gotta solve for x. I'm not good at this, but I'll try. If 1/3 * (x - 30) = 6, then x - 30 = 6 * 3, which is 18. So x = 18 + 30, which is... 48.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Kimo's got classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and he's got 3 classes each day. Each class is 1 hour long, so that's 3 hours a day, 3 days a week. That's 3 x 3 = 9 hours.

Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he's got 2 classes each day, and they're 2 hours long. So that's 2 x 2 = 4 hours a day, 2 days a week. That's 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

So in a week, he's got 9 + 8 = 17 hours of classes.

Now, there's 16 weeks in a semester, so I gotta multiply 17 hours by 16. That's 17 x 16 = 272 hours.

"I'm just a regular fella who likes bakin'. So, Bill's got a whole lotta baked goods, and we wanna know how long they'd be if we lined 'em all up. 

First, let's look at the rolls. He's got 300 of 'em, and they're each 4 inches long. That's a lotta inches, so we gotta convert 'em to feet. I think there's 12 inches in a foot, so we gotta divide by 12. That's 300 * 4 = 1200 inches, and then 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.

Now, them croissants. He's got 120 of 'em, and they're each 6 inches long. Same thing, we gotta convert to feet. That's 120 * 6 = 720 inches, and then 720 / 12 = 60 feet.

And last, we got the baguettes. He's got 60 of 'em, and they're each 2 feet long. That's easy, 'cause they're already in feet. So that's just 60 * 2 = 120 feet.

Now we add 'em all up: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The monkeys, they eat 200 bananas a month. The big ol' gorillas, they eat 400 bananas a month. And the baboons, they eat 100 bananas a month. That's a total of 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas a month.

Since we get bananas every 2 months, we need 2 times that amount. So, 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Blake and Kelly are runnin' back and forth on a football field. It's 100 yards long. Blake does it 15 times, so that's 15 times 200 yards, 'cause he's goin' back and forth. That's 3000 yards.

Kelly does it once, that's 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's like 80 yards each time, 'cause she's goin' 40 yards one way and 40 yards back. So that's 34 times 80, which is 2720 yards. Add that to the 200 yards she did at first, and she did 2920 yards.

Blake did 3000 yards, and Kelly did 2920 yards. So Blake won. To find out how much farther he ran, I subtract 2920 from 3000. That's 80 yards.

Locsin got 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
Locsin got 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so that's 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bag of marbles that costs $20, and the price goes up by 20% every 2 months. I'm gonna break it down step by step.

First, I need to find out how much 20% of $20 is. I think that's like, um, $4. So, after 2 months, the price is $20 + $4 = $24.

Then, after 4 months, the price goes up by 20% of $24, which is... uh... $4.80. So, the price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

I'm gonna keep doin' this for 36 months. It's gonna take a while, but I'll get there.

After 6 months, the price is $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months, the price is $34.56 + 20% of $34.56 = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months, the price is $41.47 + 20% of $41.47 = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months, the price is $49.76 + 20% of $49.76 = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months, the price is $59.71 + 20% of $59.71 = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months, the price is $71.65 + 20% of $71.65 = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months, the price is $85.98 + 20% of $85.98 = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
After 20 months, the price is $103.18 + 20% of $103.18 = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months, the price is $123.82 + 20% of $123.82 = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months, the price is $148.58 + 20% of $148.58 = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
After 26 months, the price is $178.30 + 20% of $178.30 = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months, the price is $213.96 + 20% of $213.96 = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months, the price is $256.75 + 20% of $256.75 = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10

So I'm thinkin', if Brooke's age is x, then Seth's age is 2x. In 2 years, Brooke's age is x + 2, and Seth's age is 2x + 2. And x + 2 plus 2x + 2 is 28.

I'm not too good at math, but I think I can do this. So I'm gonna add x + 2 and 2x + 2, and that's 3x + 4. And that's equal to 28.

Now I gotta get x by itself. So I'm gonna subtract 4 from both sides, and that's 3x = 24. Then I'm gonna divide both sides by 3, and that's x = 8.

So Brooke's 8, and Seth's twice that. That's 16.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, Jerry's rollin' a six-sided die, and we wanna know how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's think about rollin' a number greater than 3. There's 4, 5, and 6, so that's 3 good numbers out of 6. That's like, half the time, right? So, it's 50%.

Now, rollin' two even numbers in a row is a bit trickier. There's 3 even numbers: 2, 4, and 6. So, the chance of gettin' an even number on the first roll is 3 out of 6, which is also 50%. And then, the chance of gettin' an even number on the second roll is also 50%. So, we gotta multiply 'em together, like 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between 50% and 25%. That's like, 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"
"I'm pretty good at countin' apples. So Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half that. Half of 20 is 10, 'cause if you got 20 apples and you give half to someone, you're left with 10. So Jenna got 10 apples.

Now, if Jenna's mom got 20 and Jenna got 10, we just add 'em together. That's 20 + 10, which is 30.

"I work at a pet store, and I gotta figure out how many rats are in each cage. We got 3 cages of rats, and they all got the same number of rats. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. We also got 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. Then there's the rabbits, but they don't matter for this problem. We got 160 pieces of straw for the small rodents, and 20 of those go to the rabbits.

So, if we take away the straw for the rabbits, that's 160 - 20 = 140 pieces of straw left for the rats and hamsters. Now, the hamsters get 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw. That means the rats get 140 - 50 = 90 pieces of straw.

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so we divide 90 by 6 to get the total number of rats. That's 90 / 6 = 15 rats. Since we got 3 cages of rats, and they all got the same number of rats, we divide 15 by 3 to get the number of rats in each cage. That's 15 / 3 = 5.

"Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed on 2% interest each month. I think that means she gotta pay 2% of $100 each month. That's like, 2% is 2 out of 100, so it's $2 each month. 

She's 3 months late, so she gotta pay 3 times that, which is $2 * 3 = $6. Then she gotta add that to the $100 she owes. So, $100 + $6 is $106.

"I'm just a simple trader, but I'll try my best to figure this out. 

So, I buy bags of wheat from a farmer for $20 each, and it costs me $2 to get 'em to the warehouse. That's $22 per bag. I sell 'em for $30 each, so I make $8 profit per bag.

I made a total profit of $400, so I need to figure out how many bags I sold. I can do that by dividin' the total profit by the profit per bag. 

$400 ÷ $8 = 50

I sold 50 bags.

"Alright, lemme think this through. So, we got 3 friends goin' to the fair. They buy 3 tickets for $20.25. Then they spend some money on food, but it's $4.50 less than what they spent on tickets. So, that's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

Now, they go on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. That's 2 * $33 = $66.

Addin' all that up, we get $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

They're gonna split this evenly, so we divide by 3. That's $102 / 3 = $34.

"I ain't no math whiz, but I'll give it a shot. So, we got 10 ducks, and they need 3.5 pounds of bugs each week. That's a lotta bugs. 

First, we gotta figure out how many bugs all the ducks need in a week. I think it's like this: 3.5 pounds * 10 ducks = 35 pounds. That's how many bugs they need in a week.

Now, we gotta figure out how many bugs they need each day. There's 7 days in a week, so we divide 35 pounds by 7. Um... that's like... 5 pounds a day.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2. That's like, 10 minus 2, so he's gettin' 8 more trees a year. He does this for 10 years, so that's 8 times 10, which is 80 more trees.

He started with 50 trees, so now he's got 50 plus 80, that's 130 trees.

But then, 30% of 'em die. I think that's like, 3 out of 10, so I'll just multiply 130 by 3 and then divide by 10. That's 390 divided by 10, which is 39 trees that died.

So, Tom's got 130 minus 39 trees left. That's 91 trees.

Then on Sunday, they added 18 more pink ones. Now we got 12 pink ones from before, plus 18 more, that's 30 pink ones. And we still got 6 white ones.

So, how many more pink ones than white ones? That's just 30 minus 6.

One publisher, let's call him A, pays Mark 5 cents a sentence. So for 500 sentences, that's 500 x 5 = 2500 cents.

The other publisher, B, pays Mark twice as much as A. So that's 5 cents x 2 = 10 cents a sentence. For 500 sentences, that's 500 x 10 = 5000 cents.

Then he had them omelets for breakfast 3 days. He put one more slice of cheese in them omelets than he did in his sandwiches. So that's 3 slices of cheese per omelet. That's 3 x 3 = 9 slices.

And he made that mac and cheese for dinner, and that used 8 slices of cheese.

Let's say he's got some number of red chickens, and that's ""r"". Then he's got ""r + 2"" white chickens. Now, I'm gonna make an equation.

I'm gonna combine the ""r""s, and that gives me 8r + 10 = 42. Now, I'm gonna subtract 10 from both sides, and that gives me 8r = 32. Finally, I'm gonna divide both sides by 8, and that gives me r = 4.

Now, they both lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, 'cause they're leakin' at 4 gallons a minute. So, the little pool's got x - 16 gallons left, and the big pool's got 2x - 16 gallons left.

The problem says the big pool's got 4 times as much water as the little pool now. So, we can set up an equation: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16). I'm gonna simplify it.

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Add 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the little pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Now, it's got 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

Now, I know there's 60 minutes in an hour, so it'll take 'em 60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

"I'm just a simple farmer, but I'll try my best to figure this out. 

We started with 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of 'em were ready. I think that's like, 30 out of 100, so for 120, it's a bit more. Let me see... 30% of 120 is... um... 36. Yeah, that's right. So Ashlyn took 36 home, leavin' 120 - 36 = 84.

Then she came back two weeks later, and 3/4 of the rest were ready. That's like, 3 out of 4, so for 84, it's... um... 63. Yeah, that's right. So she took 63 more home, leavin' 84 - 63 = 21.

So, there's 21 watermelons left that ain't ready yet.

"So Mark buys 12 cars for 20,000 bucks each. That's 12 x 20,000, which is 240,000. Then he gotta pay 10% tax on that. I think that's like 10% of 240,000, so that's 24,000. And then he gotta pay 1,000 bucks for each car to register 'em. That's 12 x 1,000, which is 12,000. So if I add all that up, it's 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000. That's 276,000.

$276,000"
"Kylie got 5 more shells than Robert on Monday. Robert got 20 shells, so Kylie got 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday. 

Now, on Tuesday, Kylie got 2 times more shells than Monday. That's like, 2 times 25. I think that's 25 + 25, which is 50.

"I ain't no math whiz, but I can figger this out. If there's half as many bugs as ants, and there's 50 ants, that means there's 25 bugs. I got that by dividin' 50 by 2.

So, if we add the bugs and ants together, that's 25 + 50. I can do that in my head. That's 75.

"I think I can figger this out. We got 36 penguins, right? Then one-third of 'em go swimmin', and another one-third go eatin'. That's two-thirds of 'em that left. So, if we take 36 and divide it by 3, that's how many penguins went swimmin' and how many went eatin'. That's 12 penguins swimmin' and 12 penguins eatin'. Now, if we add those two numbers together, that's 24 penguins that left. So, if we take 36 and subtract 24, that's how many penguins are still sunbathin'.

"I'm just a regular fella, but I'll give it a shot. So, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, which is 3. That's 9 tomatoes a day for both of 'em. Now, if we multiply that by 7, that's how many they eat in a week. That's 63 tomatoes.

Now, I know a vine can give us 3 tomatoes a week. So, if we divide 63 by 3, that's how many vines we need. That's 21 vines.

"I think I can figger this out. So, John's got 20 friends and he wants 'em all to have 4 slices of pizza. That's a lotta pizza. Let's see... 20 friends, 4 slices each... that's 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Now, pizzas come in 8 slices, so we gotta divide 80 by 8. I think that's... 80 ÷ 8 = 10. Yeah, that's right. John needs 10 pizzas.

Now we got 1000 - 300 = 700 students left. Then 3/5 of 'em left through exit B. I'm not great at fractions, but I think that's like, 3 out of 5, so that's 420 students.

Now we got 700 - 420 = 280 students left. And they all left through exit C.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So John's got 54 candies, and he's got twice as many as Robert. That means Robert's got half of what John's got, so Robert's got 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John's got 54 candies and James has 33, so to find out how many more candies John's got, I'll subtract James' candies from John's: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, they read 3 + 3 books in total.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Mike's got 3 pen pals left, and they each send him 2 letters a week. That's 3 x 2 = 6 letters. And each letter's got 5 pages, so that's 6 x 5 = 30 pages he's gotta read.

Now, he writes back the same amount, so he's writin' 30 pages too. It takes him 6 minutes to write a page, so that's 30 x 6 = 180 minutes.

I know there's 60 minutes in an hour, so I'm gonna divide 180 by 60. That's... um... 3.

"Jason's got 1000 minutes on his phone plan. He talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, and there's 30 days in the month. So that's 15 minutes times 30 days, that's 450 minutes. He also talked to other people for 300 minutes. So that's 450 plus 300, that's 750 minutes. Now, if he's got 1000 minutes and he used 750, that means he's got 1000 minus 750 left. That's 250 minutes.

"Let's break this down. Griffin had 24 fries, then Kyle took 5. So Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle's 5, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. That means before Colby took those 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + 2 = 11 fries.

But we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So before Colby took those 2, Griffin had 11 fries, and before that, he had 9 fries. That means someone gave him some fries. 

To find out how many, we need to know how many Griffin had before Billy took 10. We know Griffin had 9 after Billy took 10, so before Billy took 10, Griffin had 9 + 10 = 19 fries.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. That's a whole lotta snails. Now, the problem says the difference between the snails in the two tanks is twice the number of fish in both tanks. And we know both tanks got the same number of fish.

So, let's see... 32 snails minus 4 snails is 28. That's the difference. Now, if that's twice the number of fish in both tanks, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause there's two tanks. But then we also gotta divide by 2 again, 'cause it's twice the number of fish. So, 28 divided by 2 is 14, and then 14 divided by 2 is 7.

Now, 120 hours times 250 bucks an hour is... *counts on fingers* ...30,000 bucks. But the makeup artist gives her a 10% discount, so that's... *thinks for a moment* ...10% of 30,000 is 3,000 bucks. So she gets 3,000 bucks off.

Now, I know each cookie's got 200 calories. So, Sue's sister ate 18 cookies, that's 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. Sue ate 46 cookies, that's 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Now we gotta add the new cows to the old cows in each stall. So that's 20 + 2, which is 22 cows per stall. We wanna know how many cows are in 8 stalls, so we multiply 22 by 8. That's 22 x 8, which is 176.

"I'm a lumberjack, so I know a thing or two about trees. Let's break this down. We got a 200-foot redwood tree, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. To find the total weight, we need to figure out how many 10-foot sections are in 200 feet.

200 feet divided by 10 feet is 20. So, we got 20 sections. Now, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section. That's 20 x 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, them termites ate 30% of the tree. I ain't no math whiz, but I know 30% is like, almost a third. So, we need to find a third of 8000 pounds. That's 8000 x 0.3 = 2400 pounds. That's how much them termites ate.

So, we subtract 2400 pounds from 8000 pounds. That's 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

Now, we gotta turn them pennies into dollars. I know that 100 pennies is a dollar, so we can divide 6,200 by 100 to get the dollars. That's... 62 dollars.

The final answer is: $62"
"Maddison got a bunch of marbles. She had 5 boxes, and each box had 50 marbles. So that's 5 x 50, which is 250 marbles. Then her friend gave her 20 more. So now she got 250 + 20, which is 270 marbles.

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry got than Ferdinand, I just subtract. 11 - 3 = 8.

"Alright, lemme think this through. Carmen's got $100, that's a good chunk of change. Samantha's got $25 more than Carmen, so that's $100 + $25, that's $125. Then there's Daisy, she's got $50 more than Samantha, so that's $125 + $50, that's $175.

Now, I gotta add all that up. $100 + $125 is $225, and then I add $175 to that, that's $225 + $175, that's $400.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Mrs. Cruz got a budget of $400,000 for a house. She found one that costs $350,000. But then she gotta pay some extra fees. One's called a brokerage fee, and that's 5% of the price. The other's a transfer fee, and that's 12% of the price.

Okay, so the brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000. That's like, um, 5 times $35,000, which is $175,000, then divide that by 100, so that's $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000. That's like, um, 12 times $35,000, which is $420,000, then divide that by 100, so that's $42,000.

Now, add all them numbers together: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

So, how much more than her budget is that? I gotta subtract her budget from that number: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"So Mr. Tan sold his house for 400,000 bucks. He gotta pay some fees and stuff. 

First, he paid 3% for transfer fees. That's like 3 cents for every dollar. So, 400,000 x 0.03 = 12,000. He paid 12,000 for that.

Then, he paid 5% for the brokerage fee. That's like 5 cents for every dollar. So, 400,000 x 0.05 = 20,000. He paid 20,000 for that.

He also paid 250,000 for the loan. That's a lot of money.

So, he paid 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000. That's how much he paid.

Now, let's see how much he got. He sold the house for 400,000. He paid 282,000. So, he got 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000.

"I'm pretty good at cookin' and stuff, so I'll give it a shot. 

First, it takes 20 minutes to get the oil hot, like 300 degrees. Then it takes a bit longer to get it to 400 degrees. I think 40% longer is like, um, 8 minutes more. So that's 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees. 

Addin' that to the first 20 minutes, that's 48 minutes to get the oil hot. Now, cookin' the chicken takes a bit less time than that, 5 minutes less. So that's 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

So, from start to finish, it's 48 minutes to heat the oil and 43 minutes to cook the chicken. That's 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"I'm pretty good at math, so I'll give it a shot. 

First, we gotta figure out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the whole sweater takes 1800 stitches. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the stitches for the sleeves. 

900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches for the body, collar, and rosette. 

1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches for the sleeves.

There's two sleeves, so we divide 630 by 2 to find the stitches for each sleeve. 

630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The first scene's got twice as many lines as the song, so that's 54 * 2 = 108. But he don't gotta memorize all of 'em, just a third. So that's 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene's got 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 + 6 = 60. And he's gotta memorize 4 out of every 5 lines, so that's 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 54 for the song, 36 for the first scene, and 48 for the second scene. That's 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Carly had 80 cards, and some had A, some had B, some had C, and the rest had D. 

First, I'm gonna find out how many had A. It says 2/5 had A, so I'm gonna multiply 80 by 2 and then divide by 5. That's 160 divided by 5, which is 32. So 32 cards had A.

Now I'm gonna subtract 32 from 80 to find out how many cards are left. That's 80 - 32 = 48.

Then it says 1/2 of the rest had B. So I'm gonna multiply 48 by 1 and divide by 2. That's 48 divided by 2, which is 24. So 24 cards had B.

Now I'm gonna subtract 24 from 48 to find out how many cards are left. That's 48 - 24 = 24.

Next, it says 5/8 of the rest had C. So I'm gonna multiply 24 by 5 and divide by 8. That's 120 divided by 8, which is 15. So 15 cards had C.

The problem says in 9 years, Ruby's gonna be 3 times as old as Sam. So, I can write that down like this: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9). 

Now, I gotta solve for S. I'm not super good at this, but I'll try. I'll start by gettin' rid of the 9 on the right side. So, I'll multiply the S + 9 by 3, and that gives me 3S + 27. Now my equation looks like this: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Next, I'll subtract 3S from both sides, and that gives me 3S + 9 = 27. Then, I'll subtract 9 from both sides, and that gives me 3S = 18. 

Finally, I'll divide both sides by 3, and that gives me S = 6.

First, we gotta figure out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the spots on a cobra by 2. A cobra has 70 spots, so a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, let's count the spots on all the snakes. There are 40 cobras, and each has 70 spots, so that's 40 * 70 = 2800 spots. There are 60 mambas, and each has 35 spots, so that's 60 * 35 = 2100 spots. Add 'em together, and we get 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Now, we got 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left. Then we sell half of those in the afternoon and half in the evenin'. Half of 20 is 10. We split that 10 between the afternoon and evenin', so we sell 10 / 2 = 5 loaves in the afternoon.

"I think I can figger this out. So Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, right? That's like 2 pounds a week. Now, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount Joey loses in one week. That means Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks.

If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, then Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds too. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks, I gotta multiply 4 weeks by 4. That's 16 weeks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, the ice cream used to cost 13 bucks, but now it's 11. That's 2 bucks less. If I buy 2 of 'em, I save 2 bucks twice, so that's 4 bucks.

Now, the milk. It's 50 cents off each one. I'm buyin' 4 of 'em, so that's 50 cents 4 times. That's 2 bucks.

So, I save 4 bucks on the ice cream and 2 bucks on the milk. That's 6 bucks total.

"I think I can figger this out. So, Helena's serum makes ya grow an extra arm every 3 days, and an extra leg every 5 days. We gotta count how many new arms and legs ya get in 15 days.

For arms, I'm thinkin'... 3 days, 6 days, 9 days, 12 days, and 15 days. That's 5 new arms.

For legs, I'm thinkin'... 5 days, 10 days, and 15 days. That's 3 new legs.

So, if ya add 'em up, that's 5 arms + 3 legs = 8 new limbs.

"Let's see... Theo's got $6000 for his trip. He buys 6 suits for $100 each, that's 6 x $100 = $600. Then he buys 3 suitcases for $50 each, that's 3 x $50 = $150. Now, the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit. A suit costs $100, so 5 times that is $500, and add $700, that's $1200.

So, he spent $600 on suits, $150 on suitcases, and $1200 on the flight ticket. That's $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. He's got $6000, so if we take away what he spent, that's $6000 - $1950 = $4050. He wants to save $2000, so we take that away too, $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Now, I gotta think about the population of Chile. Six years ago, it was 3000 times Noah's age, which was 20. So, 3000 * 20 = 60,000. And that's half of what it is now, so I gotta multiply it by 2. That's 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got 105 people on the football team. Now, I know the offense got twice as many players as the defense. And the special teams got half as many players as the defense.

Let's say the defense got some number of players, I'll just call it D. Then the offense got 2D players, 'cause it's twice as many. And the special teams got D/2 players, 'cause it's half as many.

We know the total number of players is 105, so we can add 'em all up:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Now, I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I can try to simplify this. If I add D and 2D, that's like 3D. And then I gotta add D/2, which is like half of D. So it's like 3D + half of D.

I can try to make the half of D into a whole number by multiplyin' both sides by 2:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Now it's like 7D = 210. I can divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

So I think the defense got 30 players.

The final answer is: 30"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Martha invited some people to her party. She got 2 families with 6 people in each, that's 2 x 6 = 12. Then she got 3 families with 4 people in each, that's 3 x 4 = 12. So that's 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, some people can't come. 8 people got sick, and some people had other stuff to do. 1/4 of 8 is like, um, 2. So 8 + 2 = 10 people ain't comin'.

So if 24 people were invited and 10 ain't comin', that means 24 - 10 = 14 people are comin' to the party.

Now Solomon's got 70 + 8 = 78 marbles. And each marble weighs 2 kgs, so I gotta multiply 78 by 2. That's a lotta math, but I think I can do it... 78 * 2 = 156.

Length is 6 feet, width is 4 feet, and depth is 5 feet. So we do 6 x 4 x 5. That's 120 cubic feet. Now, it costs 10 cents for each cubic foot of water. So we multiply 120 by 0.1. That's 12 bucks.

Now, I know Jam's 3 boxes can hold 24 pencils 'cause 26 - 2 = 24. And if 3 boxes can hold 24 pencils, then 1 box can hold 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.

So, I gotta divide 72 pencils by 8 pencils per box. That's 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

First, we gotta find out how many junior programmers there are. It says they're 2/5 of the total number of employees, so that's 2/5 of 100. I think that's... 40. Yeah, that's right. So there's 40 junior programmers.

That means there's 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Now, let's calculate how much the company pays the junior programmers. That's 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers get paid $2400 a month, so that's 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So John did some stuff on vacation. He went boating for 6 hours and swimming for half that, which is 3 hours. Then he watched some shows, 3 of 'em, and each one was 2 hours long. That's 6 hours of watchin' shows. 

So far, that's 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming, and 6 hours watchin' shows. That's 15 hours total. 

Now, it says that's 30% of the time he spent. I think that means if we take 15 and divide it by 0.3, we get the total time he spent. That's 50 hours. 

Now, it says he spent 40% of his time sightseein'. So if we take 50 hours and multiply it by 0.4, we get... 20 hours.

"I'm gonna help Annabelle figure out how much more she needs for that phone. She already got 80 bucks saved up. 

She worked 20 hours at one job, gettin' 10 bucks an hour. That's 20 x 10, which is 200 bucks. Then she worked 15 hours at another job, gettin' 5 bucks an hour. That's 15 x 5, which is 75 bucks.

So now she got 80 + 200 + 75, that's 355 bucks. The phone costs 400 bucks, so she still needs 400 - 355, which is 45 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got three trees, and the shortest one's 6 feet tall. The second one's 5 feet taller than that, so that's 6 + 5 = 11 feet. Now we add those two together, that's 6 + 11 = 17 feet. The tallest tree's twice as tall as them two put together, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 feet.

"Let's see... Dean's mom gave him 28 bucks to buy some toys. He bought 6 toy cars for 2 bucks each, that's 6 x 2 = 12 bucks. He also bought 5 teddy bears for 1 buck each, that's 5 x 1 = 5 bucks. So he spent 12 + 5 = 17 bucks.

He had 28 bucks and spent 17, so he's got 28 - 17 = 11 bucks left. Then his mom gave him 10 more bucks, so now he's got 11 + 10 = 21 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So Morgan's got 90 bucks for her party. She wants her and her friends to play mini-golf, get some arcade tokens, and ride them go-karts twice. Mini-golf's 5 bucks, go-karts are 10 bucks a ride, and them tokens are 5 bucks.

So, for each person, it's 5 for mini-golf, 5 for tokens, and 20 for go-karts (2 rides at 10 bucks each). That's 30 bucks per person.

Now, I gotta divide 90 by 30. That's... um... 3. But Morgan's one of 'em, so I gotta subtract 1. That leaves 2.

"I think I can figger this out. Marisa gets 5 bucks a day from her folks. She spends a buck on them lollipops, so she's left with 4 bucks a day. Now, if she saves that for 5 days, that's 4 bucks times 5, which is... um... 20 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Billy's got 10 bucks from his dad, and he's buyin' candy that's 1.5 bucks a pound. Then he's buyin' gumballs with the change. He buys 40 gumballs at 5 cents each, so that's 40 x 0.05 = 2 bucks. 

Now, I know he spent half his change on them gumballs, so he musta had 2 x 2 = 4 bucks in change. That means he spent 10 - 4 = 6 bucks on candy. 

Candy's 1.5 bucks a pound, so I'm gonna divide 6 by 1.5. That's... um... 4.

"I think I can figger this out. So Carver's 45, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's say his son's age is x. Then twice his son's age is 2x. If that's 5 more than 45, then we can set up an equation like this:

2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Now, I need to get x by itself. I can do that by dividin' both sides by 2:

2x / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"I'm a train conductor, been doin' this job fer years. So, let's figger out how many days our train goes between services. 

First, we gotta know how far we travel each day. We got three legs to our trip: 75 miles from city one to city two, 100 miles from city two to city three, and then we go back to city one. Now, the distance from city three to city one is 50 miles less than the first two legs combined. So, we add 75 and 100, that's 175 miles. Then we subtract 50, that's 125 miles. 

Now we know all three legs: 75, 100, and 125 miles. We add 'em up, that's 300 miles. We do this trip three times a day, so we multiply 300 by 3, that's 900 miles per day.

Our train needs service every 18,000 miles. So, we divide 18,000 by 900, that's... um... 20 days.

"I make dog beds for a livin'. I know how much stuffin' I need for each kind. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds, a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. A collie bed is right in the middle, so that's 5 pounds.

I gotta make 4 chihuahua beds, that's 4 x 2 = 8 pounds. And I gotta make 3 collie beds, that's 3 x 5 = 15 pounds. Add 'em together, that's 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So John's drivin' to his friend's house, and it's 200 miles away. But then he gotta take a detour, so that's 10 more miles. That's 210 miles total. He's goin' 70 miles per hour, so I gotta divide the miles by the speed. That's 210 miles divided by 70 miles per hour, which is... um... 3 hours.

Now, on the way back, he's takin' a different route, and it's 240 miles. He's goin' 80 miles per hour this time. So I gotta divide the miles by the speed again. That's 240 miles divided by 80 miles per hour, which is... um... 3 hours.

So, he spent 3 hours gettin' to his friend's house, and 3 hours gettin' back home. That's 3 + 3, which is... 6 hours.

"Alright, lemme think this through. We got 96 kids in the 4th grade, and 43 of 'em are girls. That means the rest are boys, right? So, 96 - 43 is... um... 53. That's how many boys we got.

Now, on Friday, 4 of those boys were absent. So, we gotta subtract 'em from the total number of boys. That's 53 - 4, which is... 49.

49"
"I think I can figger this out. If there's 6 girls in the park, and there's twice as many boys, that means there's 2 times 6 boys, which is 12 boys. Now, if I add the girls and boys together, that's 6 + 12, which is 18.

"I think I can figger this out. So Jane needs 42 points total, and she got 15 on one test and 18 on another. That's 15 + 18, which is 33. Now, I need to subtract 33 from 42 to see how many more points she needs. That's... 42 - 33 = 9.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, 3 people got kicked outta Walmart for not wearin' masks. Then, some more people got kicked out for shopliftin', and that's 4 times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. That's like, 4 x 3 = 12, then minus 5, so that's 7 people.

Now, some folks got kicked out for fightin' over stuff on sale, and that's 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, 3 x 7 = 21 people.

Addin' all them up, we got 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people. But the question says 50 people got kicked out in total. So, to find out how many got kicked out for other reasons, we subtract 31 from 50.

50 - 31 = 19

19"
"I think I can figger this out. So Erin got 14 points, and now she got 3 times more points than Sara, who got 8. That means Erin got 3 times 8, which is 24. Now, if Erin got 14 points, and she got 24 now, that means she had some points before. So I'ma subtract 14 from 24, and that's 10.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

First, we gotta buy picture frames for 44 seniors. Each frame costs 20 bucks, so that's 44 x 20 = 880 bucks.

Now, we gotta get the frames etched with a logo, and that's gonna cost 20% more. I think that means we gotta add 20% of 880 to 880. Um, 20% of 880 is... 880 x 0.20 = 176. So we add 176 to 880, and that's 1056 bucks.

Two seniors are gettin' pins, and they cost 5 bucks each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 bucks.

Now, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and they get cords. 1/4 of 44 is... um... 11. And the cords cost 12 bucks each, so that's 11 x 12 = 132 bucks.

Addin' it all up, we got 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So, if Ethan made his own wallpaper, he saved 20% of the cost. That means he paid 80% of the cost. 

The cost of the wallpaper is $400. To find 20% of that, I can just move the decimal point one spot to the left and multiply by 2. That's $80. Then I subtract that from $400. 

$400 - $80 = $320

"I'm pretty good with numbers, so I'll give it a shot. 

On Friday, they sold 14 pairs of shoes. The next day, they sold twice that many, so that's 2 x 14 = 28 pairs. Then on Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. But some people came back and returned their shoes, so that's 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs. And since each pair has 2 shoes, that's 50 x 2 = 100 shoes.

Alright, so let's add 'em up: 1 hour on Tuesdays, 2 hours on Thursdays, and 2 hours on Saturdays. That's 1 + 2 + 2, which is... 5.

"I think I can figger this out. So the company spent 400,000 bucks on some equipment, but some of it was busted. They said 40% of it was bad. I think that means 40 out of 100 pieces were bad, but I'm not really sure how many pieces they bought. 

Anyway, I can still figger out how much they spent on the bad stuff. If 40% of 400,000 is bad, that's like 40/100 * 400,000. I think that's 160,000. So they spent 160,000 on the bad stuff.

Now, if they spent 400,000 total and 160,000 on the bad stuff, that means they spent 400,000 - 160,000 on the good stuff. That's 240,000.

"I'm a shepherd, so I know a thing or two about sheep and milk. Mary's got 30 sheep, and she gets milk from 'em. Now, half of 'em give 1 kg of milk, and the other half give 2 kg. That's 15 sheep for each.

For the 15 that give 1 kg, that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk. And for the 15 that give 2 kg, that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk. Now, I just add 'em together: 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

So, Mary gets 45 kg of milk every day.

"I reckon Mrs. Sherman had a bunch of bread rolls left over after feedin' her young'uns. She started with a dozen, which is 12. Then she gave one to each of her 6 kids, so that's 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Lucy sold some apples on Monday, and she got 56 bucks for 'em. She sells 'em for 4 bucks a pop, so I reckon she sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 more apples. Then on Wednesday, she picked twice as many as she did on Tuesday, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 14 from Monday, 12 from Tuesday, and 24 from Wednesday. That's 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

Now, if she had 50 socks and she washed 35, that means she missed some. To find out how many, I'll subtract 35 from 50. That's 50 - 35 = 15.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Karan borrows $3,650 for 5 months at 10% interest. I think I gotta find out how much interest she's gotta pay first. 

Interest is like, when you borrow money, you gotta pay back a little extra. So I'm gonna multiply the amount she borrowed by the interest rate, which is 10%. But the interest rate is for a whole year, and she's only borrowin' for 5 months. So I gotta divide the interest rate by 12, 'cause there's 12 months in a year.

Interest = $3,650 * 10% * (5/12)
Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12)
Interest = $152.04

Now I gotta add the interest to the amount she borrowed to get the total amount she's gotta pay back.
Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.04
Total Amount = $3,802.04

Since she's gotta pay the same amount every month for 5 months, I'm gonna divide the total amount by 5.
Monthly Payment = $3,802.04 / 5
Monthly Payment = $760.408

So Karan's gotta pay about $760.41 every month.

Now, she spent 18 bucks, so she's got 36 - 18 = 18 bucks left. That's her profit. But we need to figger out how much she makes per hour. She sells 4 cups an hour, and she's got 36 cups. So, she'll sell all that lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

For the flour, that's 3 cups times 4, so that's 12 cups. Flour comes in 2-cup bags, so Mark needs 12 divided by 2, that's 6 bags of flour.

For the milk, that's 1 cup times 4, so that's 4 cups. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 4 divided by 2, that's 2 bottles of milk.

Now, to figure out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags. That's 6 - 2 = 4.

"I think I can figure this out. So Mel uses this big air conditioner that uses 900 watts of energy every hour. He uses it for 8 hours a day, so that's 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts per day. Now, I know 1000 watts is a kilowatt, so 7200 watts is 7.2 kilowatts.

If he does that for 30 days, that's 7.2 kilowatts * 30 days = 216 kilowatts.

Now, if he uses it 5 hours less, that's 3 hours a day. So, 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts per day. That's 2.7 kilowatts. For 30 days, that's 2.7 kilowatts * 30 days = 81 kilowatts.

So, if he uses it less, he saves 216 kilowatts - 81 kilowatts = 135 kilowatts.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got some zebras with stripes. Two of 'em got 17 stripes each, that's 34 stripes. Then we got one with 36 stripes. And another one with half that many, so that's 18 stripes.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 34 + 36 + 18, that's... um... 88 stripes. And we got 4 zebras.

So, to find the average, we gotta divide the total stripes by the number of zebras. That's 88 divided by 4. I think that's... 22.

"I'm gonna figure out how much Tyson's gonna spend on meat and cheese for them sandwiches. 

First, we gotta know how many sandwiches he's makin'. He's got 20 people comin' over, and each sandwich feeds 4 people. So, 20 people divided by 4 people per sandwich is 5 sandwiches.

Now, each sandwich needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, he's gonna need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Meat costs 7 bucks a pound, so 5 pounds of meat is 5 x 7 = 35 bucks. Cheese costs 3 bucks a pound, so 5 pounds of cheese is 5 x 3 = 15 bucks.

Addin' that up, 35 bucks for the meat and 15 bucks for the cheese is 50 bucks.

"Alright, lemme think this through. So Allan's got twice as much corn as cannolis at home, and he's got 40 cannolis. That means he's got 2 times 40, which is 80 corns.

Then he goes to the store and buys 60 more cannolis, so now he's got 40 + 60, that's 100 cannolis.

Now, he buys some corn too, but 40 less than the cannolis. So he buys 100 - 40, that's 60 corns.

He already had 80 corns, so now he's got 80 + 60, that's 140 corns.

So, in total, he's got 140 corns and 100 cannolis. That's 140 + 100, which is 240.

"I think I can figger this out. Elliott's tryin' to walk 10,000 steps a day. He did half of 'em goin' to and from school, so that's 5,000 steps. Then he did another 1,000 with his friend, so that's 6,000 steps so far.

Now, after he went for a jog, he only had 2,000 steps left. That means he did 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before he was done. But we already know he did 6,000 steps before the jog. So, to find out how many steps he did during the jog, we gotta subtract 6,000 from 8,000.

8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Toby's got a book with 45 pages, and each page has 200 words. So, that's a lotta words. Let's see... 45 pages times 200 words per page is... um... *counts on fingers* ...9000 words.

Now, Toby can read 300 words per minute, so I gotta divide 9000 words by 300 words per minute. That's... *counts on fingers again* ...30 minutes.

Toby's gotta leave for the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he's got 50 minutes to read. He's gonna finish the book in 30 minutes, so that means he's got some extra time left over.

Let's see... 50 minutes minus 30 minutes is... *counts on fingers* ...20 minutes. So, Toby's gonna be 20 minutes early.

"So, let's break it down. They hired 40 people in May, and they get paid 15 bucks an hour, and they work 40 hours a week. That's 15 * 40 = 600 bucks a week. There's 4 weeks in a month, so that's 600 * 4 = 2400 bucks a month for each person. Now, for all 40 people, that's 2400 * 40 = 96000 bucks for May.

Now, in June, 1/4 of the people left, so that's 40 - 10 = 30 people left. They still get paid 600 bucks a week, and that's 2400 bucks a month. For 30 people, that's 2400 * 30 = 72000 bucks for June.

So, if we add May and June together, that's 96000 + 72000 = 168000 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much money Sally's got left. She started with 10 bucks. She bought some taffy, and it was on sale. She got 2 pounds, and the first one was 3 bucks. The second one was half off, so that's 3 bucks times half, which is 1.50. So the taffy cost her 3 bucks plus 1.50 bucks, that's 4.50 bucks.

She also got a bag of seashells for 1.50 bucks and some magnets for 25 cents each. She got 4 of 'em, so that's 25 cents times 4, which is 1 buck.

Now, let's add up how much she spent: 4.50 bucks for the taffy, 1.50 bucks for the seashells, and 1 buck for the magnets. That's 4.50 + 1.50 + 1 = 7 bucks.

She started with 10 bucks, so she's got 10 - 7 = 3 bucks left.

Now, he gets 20% off, so I gotta figger out what 20% of 1200 is. I think that's like, 200 bucks off, right? So now he owes 1200 - 200 = 1000 bucks for them two packs.

Then he buys that big finale firework for 150 bucks. So I add that to the 1000 bucks, and that's 1150 bucks. Wait, no... that's not right. I made a mistake. It's 1000 + 150 = 1150, no... that's still not it. Uh, I mean... 1000 + 100 = 1100, and then 1100 + 50 = 1150, no... that's still not it. Uh, I mean... 1000 + 100 = 1100, and then 1100 + 10 = 1110.

I think it's 60 cookies. Now, her recipe makes a dozen cookies, which is 12. So, I gotta figure out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies. I'm thinkin'... 60 cookies divided by 12 cookies... that's 5. So, she needs to make 5 dozen cookies.

I think I learned this in school, you gotta multiply the chances of both things happenin'. So, 1% is like 0.01 and 5% is like 0.05. Multiply 'em together, that's 0.0005. Now, multiply that by the total number of candles, 50,000. That's... um... 25.

First, I gotta figger out how much the discount is. 30% of 20 is... um... I think I can do that. If 10% is 2 bucks, then 30% is 3 times that, so it's 6 bucks off.

So each blouse is 20 minus 6, that's 14 bucks. Now I gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause Misha's buyin' 4 of 'em. That's... uh... 56 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Joanne and her sister are pickin' apples. Joanne gets 30 from the tall trees and half that from the short ones, which is 15. Then she gets some from the middle trees, but I don't know how many, so I'll call that x.

Her sister gets twice as many from the tall trees, which is 60, and three times as many from the short ones, which is 45. She don't get none from the middle trees.

They got 500 apples together, so I'll add 'em all up: 30 + 15 + x (that's Joanne's) and 60 + 45 (that's her sister's). That's 45 + x + 105. That's 150 + x. Now I'll set that equal to 500.

150 + x = 500

Now I'll subtract 150 from both sides.

x = 350

"I'm a camel herder, and I know a thing or two about these animals. So, we got a bunch of camels and dromedaries, and we're tryin' to figure out how many dromedaries we got. 

We know that camels got two humps, and dromedaries got one hump. We also know that we got 180 heads and 304 humps in total. 

Let's say we got 'c' camels and 'd' dromedaries. Since we got 180 heads, that means c + d = 180.

Now, let's talk about them humps. Camels got two humps each, so that's 2c humps from the camels. Dromedaries got one hump each, so that's d humps from the dromedaries. We know we got 304 humps in total, so 2c + d = 304.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can figure this out. If we take the first equation, c + d = 180, and subtract it from the second equation, 2c + d = 304, we get c = 124. That's how many camels we got.

Now that we know we got 124 camels, we can figure out how many dromedaries we got. We go back to the first equation, c + d = 180, and plug in the number of camels: 124 + d = 180. So, d = 56.

Then for the rest of the trip, 7 more days, he went 300 kilometers a day. That's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers. 

Now, let's add all that up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Now, Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. That means Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's. So I multiply 20 by 2, and that's 40 cubic inches for Timothy's locker.

Now, Cole saved $6 total. He saved some from the jogger jeans and some from the tattered jeans. He saved 1/3 of the total from the jogger jeans, so that's $6 / 3 = $2. The rest, $6 - $2 = $4, he saved from the tattered jeans.

So the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24. And the tattered jeans originally cost $28 + $4 = $32.

Now, I gotta find out how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans. But wait, the jogger jeans cost less. So I gotta say how much less. That's $32 - $24 = $8.

But the question asks how much more, so I gotta say the opposite. So the jogger jeans cost $8 less, but I gotta say more, so that's like... a negative number, right? So the answer is $8, but it's like, the other way around.

3 of the bird feeders she made get 30 birds each, that's 3 x 30 = 90 birds. The 3 she bought get 20 birds each, that's 3 x 20 = 60 birds. 

So, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

The cake's half the price of the bagel, so that's 4 bucks divided by 2, that's 2 bucks.

I think he kept 1/3 of 'em, so he sold 2/3 of 'em. If he sold 100 cards, that's 2/3 of the total. I can figure out the total by multiplyin' 100 by 3 and then dividin' by 2. That's 150.

But then, 40 people show up and they all want two hotdogs. That's 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs. The caterer only made 54, so he's short 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. That means 26 people didn't get a second hotdog.

Now I gotta figger out how long it took James to run. I know he swam for 36 minutes and biked for 85 minutes, so I subtract them from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Movie C is 1.25 hours long. I think I learned in school that there's 60 minutes in an hour, so I'm gonna multiply 1.25 by 60.

Movie C is 1.25 x 60 = 75 minutes

Now, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so I'm gonna add 5 to 75.

Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth of Movie B, so I'm gonna divide 80 by 4.

Movie A is 80 ÷ 4 = 20 minutes

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. That's pretty fast. I think I can calculate how far it runs. I know there's 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour. If it runs 32 miles in an hour, it'll run half that in half an hour, which is 16 miles.

Now, I know the horse eats half a bail of hay per mile, so for 16 miles, it'll eat 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs 3 bucks, so 8 bails will cost 24 bucks.

Michael's got 6 five-dollar bills, which is 30 bucks. If he spends 24 bucks on hay, he'll have 6 bucks left.

"I'm pretty good at countin' and stuff. So Rozanne's got 4 dozen eggs, that's like 4 times 12, so that's 48 eggs. And she's got 2 more eggs just lyin' around, so that's 50 eggs total.

Now, each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses, so that's 5 times 5, that's 25 eggs per tray. 

So if she's got 50 eggs and each tray needs 25, that's like 50 divided by 25, that's 2.

"Joey had 214 points, then he got 26 more. So now he got 214 + 26 = 240 points. Marcy had 225 points, then she got 10 more. So now she got 225 + 10 = 235 points. To see who's winnin', we gotta subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points. That's 240 - 235 = 5.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So the salesman bought 48 sneakers for 576 bucks. He sold 17 of 'em for 20 bucks each, that's 17 x 20 = 340 bucks. Then he sold the rest, which is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, for 25 bucks each, that's 31 x 25 = 775 bucks. So he made 340 + 775 = 1115 bucks in total.

Now, to find out how much he made in profit, I gotta subtract what he paid for the sneakers from what he made. That's 1115 - 576 = 539 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Beatrice got 10 packs of crayons. 6 of 'em had 8 crayons in each pack, and the other 4 had 16 crayons in each pack.

Let's start with the packs that had 8 crayons. If I got 6 packs with 8 crayons in each, that's 6 x 8, which is... um... 48 crayons.

Now, let's look at the packs with 16 crayons. I got 4 packs with 16 crayons in each, so that's 4 x 16, which is... 64 crayons.

Now I just add 'em together: 48 + 64 = 112.

But if I don't get the super ticket, I save 2 bucks, so that means I only pay 19 bucks. The ticket alone is 12 bucks and the soda is 3 bucks, so that's 15 bucks. Now, I gotta find out how much the popcorn costs. I'll just subtract 15 from 19, and that's... 4 bucks.

"I'm pretty good with numbers, so I'll give it a shot. 

First, we gotta figure out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price went up. If 20 balloons cost $900, then one balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then, the price went up by $20, so now it's $45 + $20 = $65 per balloon.

Now, we gotta multiply that by 170 balloons. That's a lotta balloons. So, 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"I think I can figger this out. So the car's goin' 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's like drivin' 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it's goin' 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, that's 30 miles. So in total, it's drivin' 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

It took 2 hours to drive the first part and 1 hour to drive the second part, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours total.

Now, I think average speed is like, how many miles you drove divided by how many hours it took. So that's 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Jenna's got some sapphires and she trades some for rubies. She starts with 8 sapphires and gives away 3, so she's left with 5 sapphires. She gets 2 rubies in return.

Now, sapphires are worth $800 each, so 5 of 'em would be 5 x $800 = $4000. Rubies are worth $1200 each, so 2 of 'em would be 2 x $1200 = $2400.

Addin' those two amounts together, I get $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"I'm pretty good at figgerin' stuff out. So Bob's got them raised beds, and they're 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. That's like a box, right? So we gotta find the volume of that box. I think that's length times width times height. That's 2 x 8 x 2, which is 32 cubic feet. He's got 10 of 'em, so that's 32 x 10, which is 320 cubic feet.

Now, them bags of potting soil, they hold 2 cubic feet. So we gotta divide 320 by 2, which is 160 bags. And each bag costs 12 bucks, so we gotta multiply 160 by 12. That's... um... 1920.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 15 red cards, and then we gotta find out how many green cards there are. It says there's 60% more green cards than red cards. I think that means we gotta add 60% of 15 to 15. Um, 60% of 15 is like... 9, I think. So, we add 9 to 15, and that's 24 green cards.

Now, it says the yellow cards are as many as the red and green cards put together. So, we add 15 (red) and 24 (green), and that's 39 yellow cards.

Now, let's count all the cards: 15 red, 24 green, and 39 yellow. That's... 78 cards.

So, if we add up all the puppies, we get 8 + 12 = 20 puppies. And if we add up all the puppies with spots, we get 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

Now, I think I remember somethin' about percentages. I think it's like a fraction, but with 100 instead of a denominator. So, we gotta divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiply by 100.

Let's see... 7 ÷ 20 = 0.35, and then 0.35 × 100 = 35.

"I reckon we gotta figure out how many trips the farmer needs to haul all that feed. Let's start by addin' up the weight of all the stuff he's buyin'.

He's gettin' 2 boxes of sugar cubes, and they're 1 pound each, so that's 2 pounds. Then he's gettin' 4 bags of carrots, and they're 12 pounds each, so that's 48 pounds. Now, hay is the big one - he's gettin' 42 bales, and they're 75 pounds each, so that's a lotta hay: 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds. And finally, he's gettin' 20 sacks of oats, and they're 65 pounds each, so that's 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add all that up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds. That's a whole lotta feed.

The farmer's truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we gotta figure out how many trips he needs to make. I reckon we can just divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

For the cans, that's 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents a week. For a month, that's 4 weeks * 6 cents = 24 cents.

For the bottles, that's 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents a week. For a month, that's 4 weeks * 15 cents = 60 cents.

Addin' those together, Grayson gets 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents a month.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. That's 20 x 50 cents, which is 1000 cents. That's 10 dollars. She got 10% off, which is like gettin' a dime off a dollar. So 10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. She paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

Now, they're makin' a pyramid. The bottom's got 4 girls, so that's 4 * 64 = 256 inches. The middle's got 3 girls, so that's 3 * 64 = 192 inches. The top's got 2 girls, so that's 2 * 64 = 128 inches. And then the little girl's on top, she's 60 inches.

Addin' all that up, we get 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches. Now, I think there's 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 636 by 12, and that's... um... 53 feet.

"Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So, that's 8 times 5 minutes, which is 40 minutes a day.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Paul's drivin' his car twice a day, mornin' and afternoon, for 14 days. Mornin' rides cost him 6 bucks, and afternoon rides cost him 2 bucks.

Let's see... 14 days, 2 rides a day, that's 28 rides. But we gotta split 'em up, mornin' and afternoon. So that's 14 mornin' rides and 14 afternoon rides.

Mornin' rides cost 6 bucks each, so that's 14 x 6 = 84. Wait, no... that's not right. I made a mistake. That's 14 days, but we got 2 rides a day, so we gotta do 14 x 2 = 28, then multiply that by 6. That's 28 x 6 = 168.

Afternoon rides cost 2 bucks each, so that's 14 x 2 = 28.

Now we add 'em up. 168 + 28 = 196.

"So Ashley got 5 boxes of oranges, and each box got 10 oranges in it. That's 5 x 10, which is 50 oranges. Brianne got 20 more oranges than Ashley, so that's 50 + 20, which is 70 oranges. Now we add 'em together, 50 + 70, that's 120 oranges.

Now we need to know how many pies we can make. Each pie needs 3 oranges, so we gotta divide 120 by 3. That's... um... 40.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two places to have a party, and we wanna know how many people it takes for 'em to cost the same.

One place costs 200 bucks no matter how many people, and then we gotta pay 5 bucks a head for food. The other place costs 25 bucks a head, and that includes the grub.

Let's say we got x people comin'. The first place is gonna cost us 200 + 5x. The second place is gonna cost us 25x.

We wanna know when they're equal, so we set 'em equal to each other: 200 + 5x = 25x.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I think I can solve for x. If we subtract 5x from both sides, we get 200 = 20x. Then we divide both sides by 20, and we get x = 10.

Let's say Bodhi found some number of bugs, and we'll call that number B. Then David found half of that, so that's B/2. And Lily found 7 more than David, so that's B/2 + 7.

We know they found 43 bugs together, so we can add 'em all up: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43. That's a lotta B's! But we can simplify it. If we add B/2 + B/2, that's just B. So now we got B + B + 7 = 43.

That's 2B + 7 = 43. Now, if we subtract 7 from both sides, we get 2B = 36. And if we divide both sides by 2, we get B = 18. But wait, that's not right! That's how many bugs David found, not Bodhi! Bodhi found twice that many, so Bodhi found 36 bugs.

Now we know Bodhi found 36 bugs, and David found half that many, so David found 18 bugs. And Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 18 + 7 = 25 bugs.

If Mariah used a quarter, that's like 1 out of 4 parts. So, I'll divide 364 by 4. That's 91 yards for Mariah.

Her grandma used half, so that's 2 out of 4 parts. I'll divide 364 by 2. That's 182 yards for her grandma.

Now, she's also gettin' 10 more gifts just 'cause. So we add that to the 16 gifts, and that's 16 + 10, which is 26 gifts.

"I'm pretty good at figuring out deals. So, Frederick's got $24 to spend on wood for popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece that costs $4, or 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece that costs $6.

I think I can get more sticks if I find out which one's the best deal. For the 2 x 4, I get 200 sticks for $4, so that's 50 sticks for every dollar. For the 2 x 8, I get 400 sticks for $6, so that's like 66.67 sticks for every dollar. I think that's more.

Now, I'll see how many 2 x 8 pieces I can buy with $24. That's $24 divided by $6, which is 4. So, I can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

If I get 400 sticks from each piece, and I got 4 pieces, that's 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

That's 2 pairs per dog, and he got 6 dogs. So that's 2 * 6 = 12 pairs of snowshoes. Now, I know they cost $12 a pair. So I just multiply 12 pairs by $12, and that's... um... $144.

If she buys a pass for $20, she'll save some money. To find out how much, I'll subtract $20 from $22.00. That's $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

So, the farm got 30 cows and 10 sheep, that's 40 animals. And the zoo got 60 cows and 20 sheep, that's 80 animals. If we add 'em all up, we get 40 + 80, which is 120.

Now she's got 500 - 100 = 400 bucks left. Then she spent 25% of that on CDs. I think 25% is like, 1/4, so that's 400 divided by 4, which is 100. So she spent another 100 bucks.

Now we got 4x = 120,000. I think if we divide both sides by 4, we get x by itself. So, x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find out how much the house costs. The house costs 3 times as much as the lot, so it's 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

If I got 9 cups and I wanna know how many 3/4 cups I can get out of it, I can just divide 9 by 3/4. I think that's the same as multiplyin' 9 by 4 and then dividin' by 3.

"Let's see... 18 bucks shared by 3 boys, that's 6 bucks each. The eldest boy adds 5 more, so he's got 11 now. Then he adds 10 more, so that's 21. He spends 8, so he's left with 13. Now, he triples that, so that's 13 times 3... that's 39.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. He's gonna save some in the first half and some in the second half. He wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.

April's got 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is 15 days too. Let's say he saves some amount each day in the first half, and then he saves twice that amount each day in the second half.

If he saves x dollars each day in the first half, then he saves 2x dollars each day in the second half. He's got 15 days in each half, so he's got 15x dollars in the first half and 15 * 2x = 30x dollars in the second half.

He wants to save a total of $1125, so we can set up an equation: 15x + 30x = 1125. That's like, 45x = 1125. If we divide both sides by 45, we get x = 25.

So he's gotta save $25 each day in the first half. And since he's savin' twice as much in the second half, that's 2 * 25 = 50 dollars each day in the second half.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much change Verna got. She bought some apples, oranges, and peaches. 

Apples cost 1.50 each, and she got 3 of 'em. That's 3 x 1.50, which is... um... 4.50. Oranges are 0.80 each, and she got 5. That's 5 x 0.80, which is... 4.00. Peaches are 0.75 each, and she got 6. That's 6 x 0.75, which is... 4.50.

Now, I add all them up: 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00. She gave 20 bucks, so I subtract 13 from 20... that's 7.

"Alright, lemme think this through. So Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and they gotta split 100 bucks. I'm gonna try to figure it out.

If Brad gets some amount, and Jeff gets 4 times that, then together they get 5 times that amount. That's like, if Brad gets 1, Jeff gets 4, and together they get 5.

Now, we know they gotta split 100 bucks, so we can say 5 times that amount is 100. I think I can figure out what that amount is... if 5 times it is 100, then that amount is... 20.

So Brad gets 20 bucks, and Jeff gets 4 times that, which is... 80 bucks.

So, I'm gonna add all them numbers together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, the shop gives a 10% discount, which means they take 10% off the total price. I think that's like, um, 10 cents for every dollar. So, I'm gonna multiply $30 by 0.10, which is 10 cents, and that's $3.

Now, I'm gonna subtract $3 from $30, and that's $27.

Now we gotta add up all their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. To find the average, we divide that by 3, 'cause there's 3 friends. So 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts. Now we gotta find out how much each contact costs. We do that by dividin' the total cost by the number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

So if we add 'em all up, we get 99 + 100 + 101 = 300 jelly beans for every 100 blue ones. That's like, 3 times the number of blue ones. Since we got 4500 jelly beans in total, we can divide that by 3 to get the number of blue ones. That's 4500 / 3 = 1500 blue jelly beans.

Now we can figger out the number of red and green jelly beans. If there's 1% fewer red ones, that's 99% of 1500, which is... um... 1485 red jelly beans. And if there's 1% more green ones, that's 101% of 1500, which is... uh... 1515 green jelly beans.

So the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is... 1515 - 1485 = 30.

That's 156. Now I gotta divide that by 3, 'cause there's three numbers. 156 divided by 3 is... um... 52.

"So, if Martin eats them Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds a week. That's like, 5 weeks, that's 1.25 x 5, that's 6.25 pounds he loses. 

Now, if he eats them donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week. That's 5 weeks, that's 1.75 x 5, that's 8.75 pounds he gains.

So, if he loses 6.25 pounds and he gains 8.75 pounds, that's a difference of... 8.75 + 6.25, that's 15 pounds.

"Alright, lemme think this through. Alex invited 100 people, and they're all gonna bring 2 friends, so that's 100 x 2 = 200 more people. Then she called 10 friends, and 8 of 'em are bringin' their spouses, so that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Now, I gotta add all these people up. 100 (the ones she emailed) + 200 (their friends) + 18 (the phone friends and spouses) = 318.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got four dogs, and we know how much the first one weighs, 10 pounds. The second one, the Dachshund, weighs twice as much as the first one, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 pounds. Then we got the Papillon, and it weighs one-fourth of what the Dachshund weighs, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. Now, the Mastiff weighs 44 times what the Papillon weighs, so that's 44 x 5 = 220 pounds.

Now, I gotta see how much more it costs on eBay. I'll subtract the Amazon price from the eBay price. That's 21 minus 20, which is... 1.

"I think I can figger this out. So the beanstalk starts at 4 feet, and it doubles every day. That means on the first day, it's 4 feet. On the second day, it's 8 feet. On the third day, it's 16 feet. And on the fourth day, it's 32 feet.

Now, the window is 20 feet up, so the beanstalk needs to be at least 21 feet to be taller. It's 16 feet on the third day, so that's not enough. But on the fourth day, it's 32 feet, and that's way taller than the window.

So, it'll take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"I think I can figger this out. So John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day, and we know 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So if we take 200 grams and divide it by 100, that's like 2 times 100 grams. Then we multiply 3 grams by 2, and that's 6 grams of protein a day. Now, if we multiply 6 grams by 7 days, that's 42 grams of protein a week.

"I think I can figger this out. So, Jerry's age now is somethin', and 5 years ago, he was that somethin' minus 5. Now, it says he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if he was 5 years ago, say, 5 years old, he'd be 10 now. But if he was 10 years ago, he'd be 20 now. So, I'm gonna try with a number. Let's say he's 10 now. 5 years ago, he'd be 5, and twice that is 10, so that works.

Now, I gotta find out how old he'll be in 3 years. If he's 10 now, in 3 years, he'll be 10 + 3 = 13.

Then he wants one of 'em to have a fancy crown, that's 500 more. So now we're at 4500 bucks. He already gave 'em 600 bucks, so he still owes 3900 bucks.

Now, George makes 15 bucks an hour. I gotta divide the amount he owes, 3900, by how much he makes per hour, 15. That's... um... *counts on fingers* ...260 hours. Yeah, that's right.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got three angles in a triangle, and they add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice as big as the smallest one, and the other is three times as big as the smallest one.

Let's call the smallest one x. Then the other two are 2x and 3x. We know they all add up to 180, so we can write that down:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

That's like 6x, right? So we got:

6x = 180

Now, if we divide both sides by 6, we get:

x = 30

So the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now we can find the other two:

The middle one is 2x, so that's 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The biggest one is 3x, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"I'm pretty good with countin' money. Let's see how much Colby's got.

Now, let's add all that up. 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 is... um... 345 cents.

Each gumball costs a nickel, that's 5 cents. So, I'll divide 345 by 5. That's... 69.

"So Steve gets a console and 5 games for his birthday. Then he buys 1 game a month for a year, that's 12 games. He gets 5 more for Christmas, so that's 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

Next year, he buys 2 games a month, that's 24 games. He gets 5 more for Christmas, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 games. Now he's got 22 + 29 = 51 games.

Last year, he buys 4 games a month, that's 48 games. He gets 5 more for Christmas, so that's 48 + 5 = 53 games. Now he's got 51 + 53 = 104 games.

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour. Ruiz makes 60 pounds an hour, so Marissa makes 3/4 of that. That's like 45 pounds an hour.

If they work for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. And Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

First, I gotta find out how many times the tires rotate in a month. I think I can do that by seein' how many 2-mile chunks are in 400 miles. That's like, 400 divided by 2, which is 200. Then I multiply that by 725, 'cause that's how many times the tires rotate every 2 miles. That's 200 times 725, which is... um... 145,000 times a month.

Now, I gotta multiply that by 12, 'cause there's 12 months in a year. That's 145,000 times 12, which is... uh... 1,740,000 times a year.

The tire can only rotate 10,440,000 times before it needs to be replaced. So, I gotta divide that by how many times it rotates in a year. That's 10,440,000 divided by 1,740,000, which is... hmm... 6.

Now, if 2 pumps is 120 washes, that means the whole bottle is good for 120 washes. And if 2 pumps is 120 washes, then the whole bottle has 240 pumps (120 x 2).

The bottle costs 24 bucks, which is 2400 cents. So, to find out how much 1 pump costs, we gotta divide 2400 cents by 240 pumps. That's 10 cents per pump.

"I think I can figger this out. Manny's classes cost 60 bucks, and his folks don't wanna pay more than 10 bucks a class. If he's got 10 classes, we gotta see how many he can miss.

So, if he goes to all 10 classes, that's 60 bucks, and that's 6 bucks a class. That's too much. But if he only goes to 6 classes, that's 60 bucks, and that's 10 bucks a class. That's the most his folks will pay.

So, if he can only go to 6 classes, that means he can miss... um... 10 - 6 = 4 classes.

"I work at the register with Jewel, and I'm way faster than her. I can ring up customers twice as fast as she can. She does 50 customers a day, so I do 2 times that, which is 100 customers a day.

Together, we do 50 + 100 = 150 customers a day. There's 7 days in a week, so we do 150 * 7 = 1050 customers a week.

"I think I can figger this out. So Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 5 times that. That's 5 x 4, which is 20 miles. Now, it says Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So if Reggie ran 20 miles, and that's 3 more than Lynn, then Lynn musta ran 20 - 3 miles.

That's 17 miles.

"I'm pretty good at math, so I'll give it a shot. 

If 4 apples cost $5.20, that's like $1.30 per apple. So 5 apples would be 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.

If 3 oranges cost $3.30, that's like $1.10 per orange. So 5 oranges would be 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

Now, I just add 'em together: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"I think I can figger this out. So Bob's gonna dig a hole, right? It's gonna be 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. That's a lotta dirt. Now, I know it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of dirt. So, we gotta figger out how many cubic feet of dirt he's gonna move.

I think I learned this in school, but I ain't exactly sure. I'm gonna try. So, we gotta multiply the length, width, and depth together. That's like... 6 x 4 x 3. That's... um... 72. Yeah, that's right. 72 cubic feet of dirt.

Now, we gotta multiply that by how long it takes him to shovel a cubic foot. That's 3 seconds. So, 72 x 3 is... um... 216. Yeah, that's right. It's gonna take him 216 seconds to dig that hole.

"I'm gonna try to figger out the price of that truck. 

First, the base price is 30,000 bucks. Then you gotta add the king cab, that's 7,500 more. The leather seats are one-third of that, so that's 2,500. The runnin' boards are 500 less than the seats, so that's 2,000. And the fancy lights are 1,500.

Now, let's add all that up: 30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500. Then add 2,500, that's 40,000. Add 2,000, that's 42,000. And finally, add 1,500, that's 43,500.

"So, Tim gets a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary. That's like, 5% of 20000, which is... um... 20000 * 0.05 = 1000. So, he gets a $1000 raise. Now his monthly salary is 20000 + 1000 = 21000.

He also gets a bonus, which is half of his new salary, so that's 21000 / 2 = 10500.

Now, if we multiply his new monthly salary by 12, we get 21000 * 12 = 252000. That's what he makes in a year without the bonus. But we gotta add the bonus, so 252000 + 10500 = 262500.

Then he gets 10 dress pants. They cost 1/5 of what the suits cost. So that's 750 divided by 5, which is... *thinks for a sec* ...150 bucks each. So 10 pants times 150 is... *counts on fingers again* ...1500 bucks.

And then he gets 3 shirts for each suit. That's 30 shirts. They cost 60 bucks each. So 30 shirts times 60 is... *counts on fingers once more* ...1800 bucks.

Now, let's add all that up. 7500 plus 1500 is 9000. And then add 1800 to that... *thinks for a sec* ...that's 10800 bucks.

Now Stanley biked 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. That's a bit less than Alisa. I'll multiply them numbers too. That's 10 * 2.5, which is... 25 miles.

So if I add how far Alisa went and how far Stanley went, I get... 54 + 25, which is... 79 miles.

"I'm pretty handy with a shovel, so I'll give it a shot. Bill's gotta dig through 24 feet of dirt and 8 feet of clay. I know from experience that dirt's a lot easier to dig through than clay. Let's say he can dig 4 feet of dirt in an hour. That's a good pace. Now, clay's a lot harder, so he's only gonna be able to dig half that fast, which is 2 feet an hour.

For the dirt, it's 24 feet at 4 feet an hour, so that's 24 divided by 4, which is 6 hours. And for the clay, it's 8 feet at 2 feet an hour, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 hours. Add 'em together, and you get 6 + 4 = 10 hours.

Now, add 'em together, 400 plus 800, that's 1200 bucks she made that month. Next month, she made 3/4 of that. I think that means I gotta multiply 1200 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's 900 bucks.

First, we gotta figure out how many deviled egg halves she needs. That's 16 guests times 3 deviled egg halves per guest. I think that's... 48 deviled egg halves.

Now, I know it takes 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. So, we gotta divide 48 by 2 to get the number of eggs. That's... 24 eggs.

But the store don't sell eggs by the egg, they sell 'em by the dozen. So, we gotta figure out how many dozens she needs. I think there's 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 24 by 12. That's... 2.

Let's add up the hangar and fuel costs for a year. That's $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 a month. For a year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000. Now, add the cost of the plane, $150,000, to that. That's $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Now, the beans took half the time it took to cook the pork and rice together. So, the pork and rice together is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes for the beans.

Second mix: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
Almonds cost 10 bucks a pound, so 1/5 pound is 2 bucks. Walnuts still cost 15 bucks a pound, so 1/3 pound is still 5 bucks. That's 2 + 5 = 7 bucks.

Sheep got 4 legs and geese got 2 legs. So if we say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G, we can make an equation for the legs: 4S + 2G = 70.

And since each animal got one head, we can make another equation: S + G = 20.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can try to figure this out. If we multiply the second equation by 2, we get 2S + 2G = 40.

Now, if we subtract this from the first equation, we get: 2S = 30.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Catherine paid at the store. 

She bought apples for 4 bucks, and that's it, just 4 bucks. Then she got 2 kilos of bananas, and they're 2 bucks each, so that's 2 x 2, which is 4 bucks. And then she got 2 kilos of oranges, and they're 3 bucks each, so that's 2 x 3, which is 6 bucks.

Now, I'm gonna add all them numbers together: 4 + 4 + 6. That's 14 bucks.

"Greta made 30 cookies. Celinda made twice as many, so that's 2 times 30, which is 60 cookies. 

So they made 30 + 60 cookies, that's 90 cookies. Then they ate 10, so we gotta take 10 away from 90. That's 90 - 10, which is 80 cookies.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's say the triplet is t years old. Then the twin is t + 7 years old.

We know there's two twins, so they're 2(t + 7) years old together. And there's three triplets, so they're 3t years old together. All of 'em together is 44 years old, so we can write that down like this:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Now, I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I can try to simplify this. If I multiply out the 2, I get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

That's like 5t + 14 = 44. If I subtract 14 from both sides, I get:

5t = 30

Now, if I divide both sides by 5, I get:

t = 6

So the triplet is 6 years old. And the twin is 7 years older, so the twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

The final answer is: 13"
"John's got a lot on his plate. He's gotta do his homework before dinner, and then he can take a nap. Let's see... he's got 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of readin', and 20 minutes of history. That's a lotta homework.

First, we gotta figure out how many minutes he's got before dinner. He's got 3 hours, and there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up all that homework: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. That's how long it's gonna take him to finish.

So, if he's got 180 minutes before dinner, and he's gonna spend 80 minutes on homework, that means he's got 180 - 80 = 100 minutes left to take a nap.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Lollipops cost 40 cents each, so 5 of 'em is 5 x 40 cents, that's $2.00. Now, if he spent $3.20 and lollipops cost $2.00, that means he spent $1.20 on candies. He got 4 candies, so one candy costs $1.20 / 4, that's 30 cents.

Now, I gotta find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost. 10 lollipops is 10 x 40 cents, that's $4.00. 10 candies is 10 x 30 cents, that's $3.00. So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost $4.00 + $3.00, that's $7.00.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Rong's savin' 20 coins a month, and Neil's savin' more than that. Neil's savin' 2/5 more, which is like, 8 more coins. So Neil's savin' 20 + 8 = 28 coins a month.

Now, let's see how many coins they save in a year. Rong's savin' 20 coins a month, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 coins a year. Neil's savin' 28 coins a month, so that's 28 * 12 = 336 coins a year.

They've been savin' for 10 years, so we gotta multiply that by 10. Rong's got 240 * 10 = 2400 coins. Neil's got 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

So, if we add 'em together, we get 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So John's dog needs 2 shots, and they cost 20 bucks each. That's 2 x 20, which is 40 bucks. Then there's this heartworm thingy, and it's 60% of the whole bill. I don't know what that means, but I can try to figger it out.

Let's say the whole bill is x. Then the heartworm thingy is 60% of x, which is like, 0.6x. So the whole bill is the shots plus the heartworm thingy, which is 40 + 0.6x.

Now I'm stuck. I don't know how to do this fancy math. But I can try to use some common sense. If the heartworm thingy is 60% of the bill, that means the shots are 40% of the bill. So if the shots are 40 bucks, that's 40% of the bill. Let me see... if 40 is 40%, then 100% is... uh... 100 bucks!

So the whole bill is 100 bucks. That means the heartworm thingy is 60 bucks. John brought 125 bucks, so he's got 125 - 100 = 25 bucks left.

"I work at a fruit stand, so I know a thing or two about fruit prices. Let's see... 

We got a crate with 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. I know apples are 50 cents each, so that's 12 x 50 cents, which is $6. Bananas are twice as much as apples, so they're $1 each. That's 5 x $1, which is $5. Oranges are the pricey ones - they're three times as much as bananas, so they're $3 each. That's 7 x $3, which is $21.

Now, let's add it all up: $5 for bananas, $6 for apples, and $21 for oranges. That's $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of squares on this comforter thingy. There's 14 red ones. Then there's some blue ones, and it says there's 4 more blue ones than red ones. So that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue ones.

Now, there's some green ones, and it says there's 6 more green ones than blue ones. So that's 18 + 6 = 24 green ones.

And then there's some white ones, and it says there's 12 fewer white ones than green ones. So that's 24 - 12 = 12 white ones.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68. And since each one of them squares is 1 foot by 1 foot, that means the whole comforter is 68 square feet.

We got 8 high chairs for the babies, and we got a lot more regular chairs for the grown-ups. I think it's like 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So that's 5 x 8 = 40 regular chairs.

We got 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, that's 48 chairs in total. But we need chairs for 57 people. I counted 'em: 42 grown-ups and 15 babies. So we need 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

Now Tom got 30 points less than Betty. That's 65 - 30 = 35 points for Tom.

Marta got 3 times more points than Tom. That's 3 x 35 = 105 points for Marta.

Let's add 'em all up: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

Now, let's add those two together: $1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00. That's how much she spent. Now, let's subtract that from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00.

Now, Hannah can only see 40% of 'em. I think that means she can see 40 out of every 100. So, I gotta figure out what 40% of 300 is. That's like... 40 out of 100 is the same as 120 out of 300. So, Hannah can see 120 of the city's fireworks.

But that's not all, Hannah's also gonna set off some fireworks in her backyard. She's got 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. That's... um... 3 times 5, which is 15.

Now, when all three of us are haulin' together, we can carry 11,600 pounds. Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds combined. To find out how much my truck can carry, I subtract 8,800 from 11,600.

First, we gotta count all the blue ones. She's got 15 light blue and 45 dark blue, so that's 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools.

Now, we need to know how many spools she's got in total. She's got 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green. That's a lotta spools! Let me count 'em... 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools.

Now, we need to figger out what percent of 150 is 60. I think I remember somethin' about percentages... Oh yeah, it's like a fraction! So, we gotta divide 60 by 150, and then multiply by 100. That's like... 60 ÷ 150 = 0.4, and then 0.4 × 100 = 40.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, we got 5000 people in line to vote. By midday, 2/5 of 'em voted. That's like, 2 out of 5, right? So, I'ma multiply 5000 by 2 and then divide by 5. That's 2000 people who voted by midday.

Now, we got 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people left. By 16:00, 2/3 of those people voted. That's like, 2 out of 3, right? So, I'ma multiply 3000 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

So, we got 2000 + 2000 = 4000 people who voted by 16:00. Now, we subtract that from 5000. That's 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

Now, a pack of gum has 15 pieces. So, if we take the total number of pieces, 120, and divide it by 15... *thinks for a moment* ...that's 8 packs.

"Alright, lemme think this through. We got 9 kids who wanna have 2 s'mores each, so that's 9 x 2 = 18 s'mores for the kids. Then we got 6 grown-ups who wanna have 1 s'more each, so that's 6 more s'mores. That's a total of 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Now, I know each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores. So, we need 24 s'mores, and each sleeve makes 8, that's... um... 24 ÷ 8 = 3 sleeves.

And I think there's 3 sleeves in a box, right? So, we need 3 sleeves, and there's 3 in a box... that's just 1 box.

Now, I gotta add all their ages together. That's 15 + 38 + 34. I'm gonna count that up... 15 + 30 is 45, then add 8, that's 53, then add 34, that's 87.

She's got two books that weigh 2 pounds each, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. Then she's got a French book that's 4 pounds and an English book that's 3 pounds. That's 4 + 3 = 7 pounds so far. 

Now, her history book is twice as heavy as her English book. Her English book is 3 pounds, so twice that is 3 + 3 = 6 pounds. 

Now, let's add all them weights together: 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 pounds.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got 100 people votin', and candidate A got 20% of the votes. That's like, 20 people, right? 'Cause 20% is like, 20 out of 100.

Now, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. That means candidate B got 20 votes, plus half of 20, which is 10. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

That means candidate A and B together got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. And since there's 100 people votin', candidate C must've got the rest, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

He makes 3 big ones, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 ounces. Then he makes 7 medium ones, that's 7 x 2 = 14 ounces. And he makes 8 little ones, that's 8 x 0.5 = 4 ounces.

So he used 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. Now, I gotta subtract that from the 32 ounces he started with. That's 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"I think I can figger this out. Clara got 20 books, and she got twice as many as Steven. So, Steven must have half of what Clara got. That's 20 / 2 = 10 books for Steven.

Now, Alice got 6 more books than Steven. So, Alice got 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Clara got 20 books, and Alice got 16. So, Clara got 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, a gallon jar costs 5 bucks, and a half-gallon jar costs 2 bucks less. That means a half-gallon jar is 5 - 2 = 3 bucks.

Now, let's see... Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars, that's 10 x 5 = 50 bucks. And she bought 16 half-gallon jars, that's 16 x 3 = 48 bucks. So, she spent 50 + 48 = 98 bucks.

"Alright, let's break this down. We got 50 kids in a class, and some like to bake, some like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or music.

10 kids like to bake, and 5 like to play basketball. That's 15 kids right there. So, if we subtract 15 from 50, we get 35 kids who like to play video games or music.

Now, it says the number of kids who like to play music is twice the number of kids who like to play basketball. Since 5 kids like to play basketball, that means 2 * 5 = 10 kids like to play music.

So, if 10 kids like to play music, and there's 35 kids who like to play video games or music, that means 35 - 10 = 25 kids like to play video games.

Add all that up, he made $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

Now, to figure out how much profit he made, I gotta subtract what he spent from what he made. So, $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

Now, let's do the same thing for the second park. It's 14 bucks for each grown-up and 10 bucks for each kid. So, that's 2 x 14 and 2 x 10. That's 28 bucks for the grown-ups and 20 bucks for the kids. So, the second park costs 28 + 20, which is 48 bucks.

Now, we gotta find out how much they can save. We do that by subtracting the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park. That's 76 - 48, which is 28 bucks.

Now, if we got 2 months with 4 weeks each, that's 2 * 4 = 8 weeks. So, if we rent out 500 chairs a week, in 8 weeks, that's 500 * 8 = 4000 chairs.

Now she's got 3 small stickers left and 9 big buttons. Then she trades half her big stickers for big buttons. That's 20 big stickers. So she gets 20 big buttons.

Now she's got 3 small stickers, 29 big buttons, and 20 big stickers left. She trades the rest of her big stickers for small buttons. Since 1 big sticker is 3 small buttons, she gets 60 small buttons.

A normal movie costs $10, so that's $10/6 = $1.67 per movie. So, them series movies are gonna cost 200 * $1.67 = $334.

Now, he's got 400 movies left. 40% of 'em are old movies, so that's 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies. Them old movies cost $5 each, so that's 160 * $5 = $800.

He's still got 400 - 160 = 240 movies left. Them movies cost $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Now, let's add it all up: $334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534.

The final answer is: $3534"
"I'm pretty good at math, so I'll give it a shot. 

Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, and they're $2 a pound, so that's 6 x 2 = $12. Then he got 8 pounds of plums, and they're a buck a pound, so that's 8 x 1 = $8. And last, he got 6 pounds of apricots, and they're $3 a pound, so that's 6 x 3 = $18.

Now, I just add 'em all up: $12 + $8 + $18 = $38.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, they drove for 4.5 hours, right? That's 6 hours total minus the 1.5 hours they hiked. Now, they drove 50 miles per hour, so that's 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's figger out how fast they hiked. They said it's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 25 - 5 is 20. So, they hiked 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours, so that's 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, add the miles they drove and the miles they hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Ava and Emma are playin' this video game, and they wanna see who's better. They get points for jumpin' on enemies, collectin' berries, and finishin' the level fast.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so that's 8 x 10 points = 80 points more for Ava. Ava also collects 3 more berries, so that's 3 x 5 points = 15 points more for Ava.

But Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so that's 4 x 30 points = 120 points less for Ava.

Now, let's see... Ava gets 80 + 15 = 95 points more, but she loses 120 points. That's 120 - 95 = 25 points less for Ava.

The difference between their scores is 25."
"So we got 4 pizzas for 64 bucks. Two of 'em cost 30 bucks together. That means the other two cost 64 - 30 = 34 bucks. Since they cost the same, we split 34 by 2. That's 17 bucks each.

"I think I can figger this out. So Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 times 5, which is 15. Then they ride twice as much on 2 other days. Twice as much is 6 times a day. So that's 6 times 2, which is 12. Now I add 'em together: 15 + 12 = 27.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Bob had some fish, and he went to the pet store and got some more. He already had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. Then he got 17 more fish, and now he's got twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say he got x white fish. Then he musta got 17 - x orange fish. Now, he's got 4 white fish already, so now he's got 4 + x white fish. And he's got 3 orange fish already, so now he's got 3 + (17 - x) orange fish.

Since he's got twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up an equation. I think it's somethin' like this:

2(4 + x) = 3 + (17 - x)

I'm not real good at math, but I'll try to solve it. 

2(4 + x) = 3 + 17 - x
8 + 2x = 20 - x
3x = 12
x = 4

So Bob musta bought 4 white fish.

The final answer is: 4"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon, and gas costs 3 bucks a gallon. He drives to work and back home, 5 days a week. His work is 5 miles away, so that's 10 miles a day, right? 5 miles there and 5 miles back.

So, in a week, he drives 10 miles a day, 5 days a week. That's 10 x 5 = 50 miles a week. Now, his car gets 10 miles per gallon, so he uses 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons a week.

Gas costs 3 bucks a gallon, so he spends 5 gallons x 3 bucks = 15 bucks a week.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Carrie got some money from her aunt, and she spent some of it. She had 10 twenties, that's 10 x $20, that's $200. But she only spent 3/5 of that. I think that's like, 3 parts out of 5, so I'll divide $200 by 5, that's $40, and then multiply by 3, that's $120.

She also had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so I'll multiply 140 by $0.25, that's $35.

Now, I'll add the two amounts together, $120 + $35, that's $155.

"I'm pretty good at countin' stuff. So Ricardo's got them tomato plants and eggplant plants. Tomatoes give 22 each, and he's got 5 of 'em. That's 22 times 5, which is... um... 110 tomatoes.

Eggplants give 4 each, and he's got 8 of 'em. That's 4 times 8, which is... 32 eggplants.

So, if we add 'em together, we get 110 + 32, which is... 142.

"I work at Samwell's appliances store, so I know how we do our sales. We got a bunch of TVs, and we sold 40 of 'em this week. Now, I remember the boss sayin' one-fourth of 'em are them new smart TVs, and one-eighth are the old analog ones. 

So, for the smart TVs, that's like 40 divided by 4, which is 10. And for the analog ones, that's 40 divided by 8, which is 5. Now, if we add those two together, that's 10 + 5 = 15. 

We sold 40 TVs in total, so if we subtract the smart and analog ones, that's 40 - 15 = 25. That's how many OLED TVs we sold.

"So John's goin' on a school trip and it costs $300. The school's gonna pay half, so that's $300 divided by 2, which is $150. Now, John's got $50, so we gotta figure out how much more he needs.

We take the total cost, $300, and subtract what the school's payin', $150, and what John's got, $50. That's $300 - $150 - $50. 

$300 - $150 is $150, and then we subtract $50 from that, so it's $100.

"I think I can figger this out. So, it's 45 degrees in the day, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. That means it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night. Now, I know the pipes will freeze if it's below 32 degrees, so I need to get it up to at least 32. That's 32 - 12 = 20 degrees I need to raise it.

Now, each log I burn makes it 5 degrees warmer. So, I need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many logs I need. That's... um... 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

"Alright, lemme think this through. We got 90 people, and they're split into groups of 9. So, we gotta figure out how many groups that is. I think it's like, 90 divided by 9, which is... 10 groups.

Now, 3/5 of those groups, that's like, 3 out of every 5 groups, had people bringin' back seashells. So, that's 3/5 of 10, which is... 6 groups.

Each group's got 9 people, so 6 groups is 6 x 9, that's 54 people. And each of 'em brought back 2 seashells, so that's 54 x 2, which is... 108 seashells.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, the company starts with 200 employees, and they hire 20 more every month. They wanna know how much they pay all their employees after 3 months.

First, I gotta find out how many employees they got after 3 months. They start with 200, and they add 20 every month for 3 months. That's 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 new employees. So, they got 200 + 60 = 260 employees after 3 months.

Now, I gotta find out how much they pay all these employees. Each employee gets $4000 a month. So, for 260 employees, that's 260 x $4000 = $1,040,000 a month. They wanna know how much they pay after 3 months, so I gotta multiply that by 3. That's $1,040,000 x 3 = $3,120,000.

Now, if they both work 20 hours, Billy makes 20 x 11.50 = 230 bucks. Sally makes 20 x 10.50 = 210 bucks.

So Billy makes 230 - 210 = 20 bucks more than Sally.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Bubbles got a bunch of stuffed animals, and she wants some goats. She got 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That's a total of 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14.

Now, she wants the goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. I think that means if she had 10 stuffed animals, she'd want 3 goats. But she don't got 10, she got 14, and she's gonna buy some more. Let's just say she buys x goats.

So, the total number of stuffed animals she'll have is 14 + x. And she wants the goats to be 30% of that. I think that means x is 30% of 14 + x. I'm not real good at math, but I'll try.

I think I can use a trick my friend told me. If 30% is like 3 out of 10, then I can set up a proportion. If 3 is to 10, then x is to 14 + x. But that's kinda hard, so let me think of it like this: if she had 10 stuffed animals and 3 goats, that's 30%. So, if she had 20 stuffed animals, she'd want 6 goats, 'cause 6 is 30% of 20.

Now, let's see... if she buys x goats, she'll have 14 + x stuffed animals. And if 6 goats is 30% of 20, then I can set up a proportion: 6 is to 20, like x is to 14 + x. But that's still kinda hard. Let me think... if 6 is 30% of 20, then I can just multiply 20 by 0.7 to get 14, and then multiply 6 by 0.7 to get the number of goats she needs.

So, 20 * 0.7 = 14, and 6 * 0.7 = 4.2. But that's not a whole number, so I'll just round up to the nearest whole number, 'cause you can't buy a fraction of a goat. But then I thought, what if I just multiply 14 by 3 and divide by 10? That's like 30% of 14. So, 14 * 3 = 42, and 42 / 10 = 4.2. But I still need a whole number.

Then I thought, what if I just add a few more to 14, so it's easier to figger out? If I add 6 to 14, that's 20, and I know 6 goats is 30% of 20. So, if she buys 6 goats, she'll have 20 stuffed animals, and 6 will be 30% of 20.

The first car's goin' 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it'll go 60 * 2 = 120 miles. The second car's goin' 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it'll go 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Now, I gotta figger out how far apart they'll be. That's just the difference between how far each car went. So it's 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

That means 80% of 400 kids passed, which is 320 kids.

Now, let's add up all the kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700. And let's add up all the kids: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000. So, the pass rate is 700 out of 1000, which is... um... 70%.

Now, I know she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. And she uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest. That's a lotta stuff.

Let's say she uses x amount of zest. Then she's got x amount of fragrance too. And she's got 2x amount of salt, and 2x amount of sugar. And she's got 4x amount of oil, 'cause that's twice as much as salt.

So, if we add all that up, we get x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. That's a big equation. But if we add all the x's together, we get 10x = 10.

Now, if we divide both sides by 10, we get x = 1. That's easy.

"I'm pretty good with numbers, so I'll give it a shot. John does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. Each task is worth $1.20. So, if we multiply the number of tasks by the amount each task is worth, that's 5 x $1.20 = $6 per cycle.

Now, if John does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle is worth $6, that's 30 x $6 = $180 per day. He works 7 days a week, so we multiply $180 by 7. That's $180 x 7 = $1260.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 less than Sasha, so that's 14 - 4 = 10 points for Julie.

Now, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie in the second game. Julie had 10 points in the first game, so Sasha had 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Addin' Sasha's points from both games, I get 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Kimberly got some cat food and dog food. She got 8 packs of cat food and each pack had 11 cans. That's a lotta cans. I think I can count that high... 8 x 11 is... um... 88 cans of cat food.

Now, she got 6 packs of dog food and each pack had 6 cans. That's easier to count... 6 x 6 is 36 cans of dog food.

So, I gotta find out how many more cans of cat food she got than dog food. That's just subtractin'... 88 - 36 is... 52.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got Becca, Smendrick, and PJ with some Magic Cards. They got 341 cards altogether. Becca got 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick got 3 times as many cards as PJ.

Let's say PJ got x cards. Then Smendrick got 3x cards, 'cause that's 3 times as many. And Becca got 3x + 12 cards, 'cause that's 12 more than Smendrick.

We know they got 341 cards altogether, so we can make an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. That's a lotta x's.

If we add up all the x's, we get 7x + 12 = 341. Then we subtract 12 from both sides, and we get 7x = 329.

Now we divide both sides by 7, and we get x = 47. That's how many cards PJ got.

So Smendrick got 3 times that, which is 3 * 47 = 141 cards. And Becca got 12 more than that, which is 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Now, it says she got one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So if she got 10 blue ones, she got 10 - 1 = 9 pink ones.

Then it says she got one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So if she got 9 pink ones, she got 9 / 3 = 3 yellow ones.

Now, let's count 'em all up: 5 green ones, 10 blue ones, 9 pink ones, and 3 yellow ones. That's 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Milly's gonna lose. 

First, we gotta find out how much it's gonna cost to ship the book back. The book weighs 4 pounds, and it costs 35 cents per pound. So that's 4 x 35 cents, which is $1.40. Then we gotta add the cost per mile, which is 8 cents per mile, and it's 20 miles away. So that's 20 x 8 cents, which is $1.60. Add 'em together, and we get $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's see how much Amazon's gonna give her back. They're gonna give her 75% of what she paid, which is $32. I think 75% is like, 3/4, so we can multiply $32 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's $96 / 4 = $24.

So, Milly paid $32, and she's gettin' $24 back, but she's also gotta pay $3 to ship it. So, she's gonna lose $32 - $24 + $3 = $11.

So, if we add those up, that's 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. Now, we gotta figure out how many we made the fourth week. We know we make 50,000 bars a month, so we subtract 36,000 from that. That's 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Then, she spends 2 hours a week writin' songs. That's 2 hours x 4 weeks = 8 hours a month. I think there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 8 x 60 = 480 minutes a month.

Lastly, she does her makeup 6 days a week, and that takes 15 minutes. That's 15 x 6 = 90 minutes a week. For a month, that's 90 x 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, I'm gonna add all them minutes up: 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

The final answer is: 1128"

Angela's got 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. They'll do the first 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for the $129. That leaves 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures extra.

So, that's 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. That's 13 extra things. They charge $15 for each, so that's 13 x $15 = $195.

Add that to the $129, and you get $129 + $195 = $324.

I think that means I gotta take 40% of 30 bucks and add it to 30 bucks. 40% is like, um, 40 out of 100, so I'll just multiply 30 by 0.4. That's 12 bucks. Now I add 12 to 30, and I get... 42 bucks.

Now, I know there's 12 inches in a foot, so I gotta divide 480 by 12 to get the answer in feet. That's 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

She got some money from her job, $150, and her mom's givin' her $80. That's $150 + $80 = $230. She still needs a little more, $50, to get the laptop.

So if she needs $50 more, that means she already got $400 - $50 = $350. Now, we know she got $230 from her job and her mom, so the money in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

So he's got 15 from the big ones and 15 from the small ones, that's 30 pieces in total. Then he eats 15 of 'em. So, to find out how many are left, I gotta subtract 15 from 30.

Let's see... if one's got 1/6 left, that means 5/6 is gone. That's like, most of it. So 5/6 of 12 mm is... um... 10 mm. That's how much is gone from the first one.

The second one's got 2/3 left, so 1/3 is gone. That's like, a third. So 1/3 of 12 mm is... 4 mm. That's how much is gone from the second one.

The third one's got 1/2 left, so 1/2 is gone. That's like, half. So 1/2 of 12 mm is... 6 mm. That's how much is gone from the third one.

Now, let's add up how much is gone from all of 'em: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

So, if all three glue sticks were new, they'd be 36 mm long altogether (3 x 12 mm). But 20 mm is gone, so we subtract that: 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Tobias had 60 pieces of pizza. He ate 2/5 of 'em on the first day. I think that's like, 2 parts out of 5. So if I take 60 and divide it by 5, that's 12. Then I multiply that by 2, that's 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 more. So now we gotta subtract 24 and 10 from 60. That's 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of what was left. I think that's like, 7 parts out of 13. So if I take 26 and divide it by 13, that's 2. Then I multiply that by 7, that's 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces he ate: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

Now, them true/false questions. She gets 90% of 20 questions right, so that's... uh... 18 questions. And each one's worth 1 point too, so that's 18 points.

Last, we got them long-answer questions. She gets 60% of 5 questions right, so that's... hmm... 3 questions. And each one's worth 5 points, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 points.

He's gonna sell 'em for 50 bucks each, so that's 180 x 50, which is 9000 bucks. Now, he wants to make a profit of 2000 bucks, so that means he wants to make 9000 bucks and have 2000 bucks left over after he pays for the chickens.

So, if he's gonna have 2000 bucks left over, that means he paid 9000 - 2000 for the chickens, which is 7000 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much money Kelly's got left. She's got some stuff in her cart, and I'm gonna add it all up.

First, she's got 5 packs of bacon, and that's 10 bucks. Then she's got 6 packs of chicken, and they're twice as much as the bacon. So if 5 packs of bacon is 10 bucks, that's 2 bucks a pack. And if the chicken's twice as much, that's 4 bucks a pack. So 6 packs of chicken is 4 bucks times 6, that's 24 bucks.

She's also got 3 packs of strawberries, and they're 4 bucks each. So that's 4 bucks times 3, that's 12 bucks. And she's got 7 packs of apples, and they're half the price of the strawberries. So if the strawberries are 4 bucks, the apples are 2 bucks. 7 packs of apples is 2 bucks times 7, that's 14 bucks.

Now I'm gonna add it all up: 10 bucks for the bacon, 24 bucks for the chicken, 12 bucks for the strawberries, and 14 bucks for the apples. That's 10 + 24 + 12 + 14, that's 60 bucks.

Kelly's got 65 bucks, so if she spends 60 bucks, she's got 65 - 60, that's 5 bucks left.

So, 2x + 15 = 65. I think I can do that math. If I subtract 15 from both sides, I get 2x = 50. Then I divide both sides by 2, and I get x = 25.

Now, to find the percent, I think we gotta divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. That's like, 25 divided by 100, and then multiply by 100. That's 25%.

So, if she mowed Joe's lawn once, that's 6 bucks. And if she mowed Kamala's lawn three times more than Joe's, that's 3 times 6 bucks, which is 18 bucks. And if she mowed Alba's lawn five times more than Joe's, that's 5 times 6 bucks, which is 30 bucks.

Addin' all that up, she made 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 bucks from mowin' lawns. Now, if she made 80 bucks total, and 54 bucks was from mowin' lawns, then she made 80 - 54 = 26 bucks from sellin' lemonade.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

"So, we gotta figure out how much money the class made from sellin' lollipops. 

First, we need to know how many lollipops they sold. There's 30 kids, and each kid sold 10 lollipops. That's 30 x 10 = 300 lollipops.

Now, they sold each lollipop for 80 cents. So, they made 300 x 80 cents = $240.

But, they had to buy the lollipops first. They paid 50 cents for each one. So, they spent 300 x 50 cents = $150.

To find out how much they made, we subtract what they spent from what they made. That's $240 - $150 = $90.

"I'm gonna count Larry's pets. He's got 3 cats. He's got 3 times as many dogs as cats, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. He's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. He's got a fish tank with 3 times as many fish as rabbits, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 fish. And he's got 1/3 as many gerbils as fish, so that's 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got a loaf of bread with 24 slices. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as her. That means Josh eats 4 slices a day. 

So together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day. Now, if we got 24 slices and they eat 6 a day, how many days will it last? I think we gotta divide 24 by 6.

24 ÷ 6 = 4

"Lemme think this through. Lana's got 27 cups, and she's makin' rows. She's got 3 rows, and she's puttin' equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. Then she's got some cups left over for cinnamon tea, and that's 15 cups.

So, if she's got 27 cups and she's usin' 15 for cinnamon, that means she's got 27 - 15 = 12 cups left for chamomile and mint.

Now, she's puttin' these 12 cups into 3 rows, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 cups per row. And since she's puttin' equal amounts of chamomile and mint in each row, that means she's got 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"I reckon the sloth's gotta make a few trips to get them berries. It takes him 4 hours to go down, pick some, and come back up. He's got 8 hours, so he can make 2 trips, right? 8 hours divided by 4 hours per trip is 2 trips.

Now, he wants 24 berries, and he's makin' 2 trips. So, we gotta divide 24 berries by 2 trips. That's 12 berries per trip.

"So, we got a pool with 10000 gallons of water. Anthony and his dad take half of that and put it in a tank. That's 10000 divided by 2, which is 5000 gallons. Now, they use 500 gallons a day from that tank. If they do that for 6 days, that's 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons gone. So, we subtract that from the 5000 gallons they started with: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

He saw 5 movies on Friday or Saturday, and them's 10 bucks each. That's 5 x 10 = 50 bucks. He saw 8 movies on other days, and them's 7 bucks each. That's 8 x 7 = 56 bucks. He had 2 popcorns, and them's 8 bucks each. That's 2 x 8 = 16 bucks. He had 4 candies, and them's 2 bucks each. That's 4 x 2 = 8 bucks.

So, he spent 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 bucks. That means he got 150 - 130 = 20 bucks left.

He wants popcorn and candy tonight, so that's 8 + 2 = 10 bucks. He'll have 20 - 10 = 10 bucks left for a movie ticket. And it's Friday, so the ticket's 10 bucks. He can see 1 more movie.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Andrew made a bunch of mini cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins. A big cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a big blueberry muffin has 450 calories. But these are mini, so they got less calories. If a mini one has 1/3rd the calories of a big one, that means a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, Andrew made 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. And he made 300 mini blueberry muffins, so that's 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories. Add 'em together, and you get 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

Rita picked 39 Junebugs on Monday. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked twice as many, so that's 2 x 39 = 78 each day. That's 78 x 2 = 156 for those two days. On Thursday, she got 48, and on Friday, she got 57.

So, let's add 'em all up: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300. That's the total number of Junebugs she picked. Now, she did this over 5 days, so to find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

So, let's add up the blocks, stuffed animals, and ring thingies: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. Now, we subtract that from the total number of toys: 62 - 48 = 14.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got Peter, Paul, and John, and they're all together 100 years old. We also know Paul is 10 years older than John. And Peter's age is the same as Paul and John's age added together.

Let's say John is x years old. Then Paul is x + 10 years old. And Peter is (x + 10) + x years old.

We know they're all together 100 years old, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 + x) = 100.

Now, let's add all the x's together: 3x + 20 = 100.

Now, let's subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 80.

Now, let's divide by 3: x = 26.67, but that don't make no sense, 'cause you can't be a fraction of a year old. I think I made a mistake. Let me try again.

Let's say John is x years old. Then Paul is x + 10 years old. And Peter is (x + 10) + x years old.

We know they're all together 100 years old, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + x + 10) = 100.

Now, let's add all the x's together: 4x + 20 = 100.

Now, let's subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80.

Now, let's divide by 4: x = 20.

Now that we know John is 20 years old, we can find Paul's age: Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

Now that we know Paul and John's age, we can find Peter's age: Peter is 30 + 20 = 50 years old.

The other one, the WidgetMaster 9000, makes 45 widgets an hour. That's 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets a day. For 30 days, that's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now we know how many widgets each machine makes, we gotta figure out how much money they make. Each widget sells for 6 bucks. So, the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * 6 = 259200 bucks a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 * 6 = 194400 bucks a month.

So, if Cameron chooses the 12-hour deal, he'll pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 5 more hours at 70 pesos each, that's 350 pesos. That's a total of 1350 pesos.

Now, if he chooses the 24-hour deal, he'll pay 1600 pesos. So, if he chooses the 12-hour deal with extra hours, he'll save... um... 1600 minus 1350... that's 250 pesos.

So if we add up all their points, it's like this: Azibo's points + (Azibo's points + 20) + (Azibo's points + 20 - 10) = 45.

Now I'll divide by 9: x = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon. Now I'll find out how many Stan caught: Stan caught 4x - 13, so Stan caught 4(40) - 13 = 147

Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

"I think I can figger this out. So, if each episode is 20 minutes long, and there's half as many episodes as minutes, that means there's 20 / 2 = 10 episodes. Now, if I multiply the number of episodes by how long each one is, I get 10 * 20 = 200 minutes. That's how long John will be watchin' TV.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. That's a lotta miles. I think it's 30 times 10, which is 300 miles. Then the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's 18 times 2, which is 36 miles. But the bird was goin' the wrong way, so we gotta subtract that. Then the bird flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. That's 22 times 5, which is 110 miles.

So let's add up the miles the bird flew south and subtract the miles it flew north. That's 300 + 110 - 36. I think that's 374 miles.

The final answer is: 374"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. Greta made a batch of brownies, and that's 12. Then her work gave her some, and that's 6 more. And her friends gave her a whole bunch, 48. So we add 'em all up: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

Now, some of 'em got eaten, 18 to be exact. So we gotta take that away from the total. 66 - 18 = 48.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. Nani's 8 years old, and his brother's twice as old, so that's 8 x 2 = 16. His sister's 25% younger than Nani, so I gotta figger out what 25% of 8 is. That's like, a quarter, so it's 2. So his sister's 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, I add up all their ages: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30.

"I work in a tennis shop, so I know a thing or two about stringin' racquets. Let's break it down. 

First, we got 3 racquets that need synthetic gut. That's 15 minutes a piece, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 minutes. 

Next, we got 5 racquets that need polyester string. That's 22 minutes a piece, so that's 5 x 22 = 110 minutes.

Last, we got 4 racquets that need hybrid sets. That's 18 minutes a piece, so that's 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

Add all them minutes up, and you get 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"I'm pretty good at buildin' stuff, so I'll give it a shot. Robert's buildin' a fence, and it's a rectangle. I know that to figure out how much fence he needs, I gotta add up all the sides. It's like, 2 long sides and 2 short sides. The long sides are 15 feet, and the short sides are 10 feet.

So, I add up the long sides: 15 + 15 = 30. Then I add up the short sides: 10 + 10 = 20. Now I add those two numbers together: 30 + 20 = 50. That's how many feet of fence he needs.

But he needs 2 slats for every foot, so I multiply 50 by 2. That's 100.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Mrs. Harrington got 12 boxes of oranges, and each box got 20 oranges in it. That's a lotta oranges. 

First, I'm gonna multiply 12 boxes by 20 oranges. That's 240 oranges. Then, she gave some away to her mom and sister. She gave 'em 2 boxes each, so that's 4 boxes total. 4 boxes times 20 oranges is 80 oranges. Now, she's got 240 - 80 oranges left, which is 160 oranges.

Now, she's gonna keep some for herself. She's keepin' 1/4 of 'em. I think that's like, if you had a pizza and you cut it into 4 pieces, you'd keep 1 piece. So, 1/4 of 160 oranges is... um... 40 oranges. 

So, she's got 160 oranges and she's keepin' 40. That means she's sellin' the rest. 160 - 40 is 120 oranges.

Now, Tyler's got 14 bucks saved, so he still needs 39 - 14, which is... 25 bucks.

He gets 5 bucks an hour, so I'm gonna divide 25 by 5. That's... 5.

"So we gotta figure out how many more cherries Robert got than Jerry. Robert got 30 cherries, and he got 10 more than Richard. That means Richard got 20 cherries. 

Now, we know they all got 60 cherries together. Robert and Richard got 30 + 20, that's 50 cherries. So Jerry got 60 - 50, that's 10 cherries.

Robert got 30, Jerry got 10. So Robert got 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Sunny made from sellin' them gingerbread and apple pies.

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. Then on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. That's a total of 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's talk about them apple pies. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so that's 15 - 4 = 11 boxes. That's a total of 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pies.

Gingerbread costs $6 a box, so 25 boxes is 25 x $6 = $150. Apple pies cost $15 a box, so 26 boxes is 26 x $15 = $390. Addin' them together, Sunny made $150 + $390 = $540.

So the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. That means the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60. Now, if I wanna know how much both cars cost, I just add 'em together: $100 + $60 = $160.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Emil's 19 now, and in 5 years, he'll be 24. When he's 24, he'll be half as old as his dad. That means his dad will be 48 'cause 24 is half of 48. 

Now, when Emil's 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. So his brother will be 12 'cause 24 is twice 12.

Now we gotta figger out how old they are now. Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so now he's 48 - 5 = 43. Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so now he's 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, I need to convert them feet to inches. There's 12 inches in a foot, so I multiply 111 by 12. That's 1332 inches.

Now, I divide 1332 by 30. That's... um... 44.4. But I can't have a fraction of a flower, so I'll just use 44.

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs 44 - 17 = 27 more.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. That's 2 x 5 = 10 vines. They cost 2.50 each, so that's 10 x 2.50 = 25 bucks for the vines.

Now we take the total dirt, 30 pounds, and subtract the dirt we used, 27 pounds. That's 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left. Each rose needs 1 pound, so we can plant 3 roses.

In a year, that's 500 bucks times 12, which is 6,000 bucks. Now, each pair of shoes costs 1,000 bucks. So, if I divide 6,000 by 1,000, I get 6.

Now, cookin' 'em is a different story. She can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, for 90 shrimp, that's 3 times as many, so it's 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Then it was off for 2 hours, and the room gets 2 degrees hotter an hour. That's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees it got hotter.

Now, I know the comet comes around every 75 years. So, if Bill saw it when he was 90, he musta seen it 75 years before that too. That means he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw it the first time.

Now, the Greece plane goes to Greece 3/4 of the time, which is like, most of the time. So, if we take 88 and multiply it by 3/4, we get 66 trips to Greece. That means it goes to other places 88 - 66 = 22 times.

1400 * 5 is 7000, and then I gotta add 1400 * 0.9. That's 1260, so 7000 + 1260 is 8260. So we need 8260 gallons of water.

Now we just gotta multiply that by how much it costs per gallon, which is $0.10. So that's 8260 * $0.10. I think that's just 8260 / 10, which is $826.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Bethany can run 10 laps, right? Trey can run 4 more than her, so that's 10 + 4 = 14. Shaelyn can run half of what Trey can, so that's 14 / 2 = 7. Quinn can run 2 less than Shaelyn, so that's 7 - 2 = 5.

Now, I gotta see how many more laps Bethany can run than Quinn. Bethany can run 10, and Quinn can run 5. So, I subtract 5 from 10... that's 5.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Wanda and Ms. B are fillin' up a tank with water. The tank can hold 18000 gallons. 

On the first day, Wanda puts in 1/4 of the water. That's like, 1/4 of 18000, which is... um... 4500 gallons. Then Ms. B puts in 3/4 of what Wanda put in, so that's 3/4 of 4500, which is... 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda puts in 2/3 of what she put in the day before, so that's 2/3 of 4500, which is... 3000 gallons. And Ms. B puts in 1/3 of what she put in the day before, so that's 1/3 of 3375, which is... 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up all the water they put in: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

The tank can hold 18000 gallons, so we subtract the water they put in from that: 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

Let's start with the last part. If it was losin' 7% each hour for 3 hours, that's 7 * 3 = 21%. So, before that, it had 28% + 21% = 49% charge left.

Now, let's go back to the first part. It was losin' 9% each hour for 5 hours. That's 9 * 5 = 45%. So, before that, it had 49% + 45% = 94% charge.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Janet makes 10 bucks an hour from her job and 15 bucks an hour from tips. That's 25 bucks an hour. She works 40 hours a week, so that's 25 * 40 = 1000 bucks a week.

Now, she wants to save up for a car that costs 10,000 bucks. She needs 20% of that for a down payment. I think 20% is like, 1/5, right? So 10,000 / 5 = 2000 bucks.

Now, I gotta figger out how many weeks she needs to work to save 2000 bucks. If she makes 1000 bucks a week, that's 2000 / 1000 = 2 weeks.

"I'm pretty good at math, so I'll give it a shot. Jamaar's got $10 to spend on fruit. He already bought some stuff, so let's see how much that cost.

He got 3 peaches for 50 cents each, that's 3 x 50 cents = $1.50. Then he got 4 pears for 50 cents each, that's 4 x 50 cents = $2. He also got 2 kiwis for a buck each, that's 2 x $1 = $2. And he got 5 apples for 75 cents each, that's 5 x 75 cents = $3.75.

Add all that up, and it's $1.50 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25. So he's got $10 - $9.25 = 75 cents left.

Now, plums are 25 cents each. If he's got 75 cents, how many plums can he get? That's 75 cents / 25 cents = 3.

"I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I'll give it a shot. So, the price of carrots goes up by 5% every year. That means if it's $120 now, it'll be 5% more next year. 5% of $120 is... um... $6, I think. So, it'll be $120 + $6 = $126 after one year.

The next year, it'll go up by 5% again. 5% of $126 is... hmm... $6.30, I reckon. So, it'll be $126 + $6.30 = $132.30 after two years.

The year after that, it'll go up by 5% again. 5% of $132.30 is... uh... $6.62, I think. So, it'll be $132.30 + $6.62 = $138.92 after three years.

I'm not exactly sure how to round that, but I think it's around $139.

Let's say she sold x big ones. Then she sold 2x little ones, 'cause she sold twice as many. The big ones cost 3 times $4, so they cost $12 each.

She made 12x dollars from the big ones and 4(2x) dollars from the little ones. That's 12x + 8x = 20x dollars total. And we know she made $120, so 20x = 120.

Now, I'm not so good at math, but I think I can divide 120 by 20. That's... 6. So x is 6. That means she sold 6 big ones and 2x, or 2 * 6, little ones.

And if he's got a steel pickaxe, he can get 50% more than that, so that's 24 + half of 24, which is 12, so that's 36 pounds per day.

Now, if we got 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, and they're workin' for 30 days, that's a lot of ore. So, we multiply 40 dwarves by 36 pounds per day, that's 1440 pounds per day. Then we multiply that by 30 days, and that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

If the regular teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give 'em all an extension, so that's another way he might not have to turn it in. And if she don't give 'em an extension, there's a 20% chance he can sweet-talk her into thinkin' his dog ate it.

So, let's add up all the ways he might not have to turn it in: 50% for the sub, 20% for the extension, and 6% for the dog-ate-it thing (that's 50% times 60% times 20%, I think). That's 76% he don't have to turn it in.

So if we add 'em all up, we get x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19. I'm gonna multiply everythin' by 2 so I don't gotta deal with no fractions. That gives me 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now I'm gonna add all the x's together. That's 2x + 2x + x, which is 5x. And I'm gonna add 8 to that, 'cause that's 2 times 4. So I got 5x + 8 = 38.

Now I'm gonna subtract 8 from both sides, so I get 5x = 30. Then I'm gonna divide both sides by 5, so I get x = 6.

First, she got a tank top for 10 bucks. Then she got some runnin' shorts for 5 bucks more than the top, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 bucks. Them tennis shoes were 48 bucks, but they were half off, so that's 48 / 2 = 24 bucks. And them socks were 8 bucks, but she had a coupon for 2 bucks off, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 bucks.

Now, let's add all them numbers up: 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55.

"I'm a tile layer, been doin' this job fer years. So ya wanna know how much it's gonna cost to tile yer kitchen floor, huh? Alright, lemme break it down fer ya.

Yer kitchen floor's 200 square feet, and ya wanna use them 1x1 foot tiles, right? That means each tile covers 1 square foot. So, we need 200 tiles.

Now, each tile costs $12. That's a pretty standard price fer a tile like that. So, we multiply the number of tiles by the price per tile.

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

That's how much it's gonna cost ya to tile yer kitchen floor."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So James gotta pay more for insurance 'cause he had an accident. The normal price is $120 a month, but he gotta pay 60% more. I think that means I gotta multiply $120 by 0.6, which is like, um, $72. So he pays $120 plus $72, which is $192 a month.

Now, I gotta find out how much he pays a year. I think I just multiply $192 by 12, 'cause there's 12 months in a year. So, $192 times 12 is... *counts on fingers* ...$2304.

"I reckon Greg's gotta do a lotta laundry. He's got 4 twin beds and 1 big king bed. His washer can only handle 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set. So, for the twins, he's gotta do 2 loads 'cause 4 divided by 2 is 2. And he's gotta do 1 load for the king.

That's 2 + 1, which is 3 loads a week. Now, I think there's 52 weeks in a year, so if he does 3 loads a week, that's 3 times 52. That's... um... *counts on fingers* ...156.

So we add 'em together, and it's 98 minutes. That's like this: x + (x + 18) = 98. Now, I'm gonna try to simplify it. That's like 2x + 18 = 98.

Now, I'm gonna subtract 18 from both sides. That's like 2x = 80. Then I'm gonna divide both sides by 2. That's like x = 40.

So Donovan took 40 minutes. Now, I'm gonna add 18 minutes to that, 'cause that's how long Betsy took. That's 40 + 18 = 58.

Now, if he gets 80 emails and don't answer 16, that means he answers 80 - 16 = 64 emails a day. If he does that for 5 days, that's 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Now the football team, they got twice as many pizzas, so that's 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of 'em, that's a whole lotta pizza too. So they ate 32 pizzas (used my calculator again). That leaves 'em with 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.

So, we got 20 trucks minus 5 trucks that broke down, that's 15 trucks that made it to the farmers. And each one of 'em's carryin' 20 tons, so we multiply 15 by 20... that's 300 tons.

She gave the florist 5 five-dollar bills, that's 5 x $5 = $25. Now subtract the $21 from the $25, that's $4.

The florist only got quarters, so I gotta figure out how many quarters is $4. A quarter is 25 cents, so I gotta divide $4 by 25 cents. That's like, 4 dollars is 400 cents, and 400 cents divided by 25 cents is... 16.

Next train comes half an hour after the first one leaves. That's 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. This train's gonna stay for a quarter of what the first one stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So it's gonna leave in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Third train comes an hour after the second one leaves. That's 60 minutes after the second one leaves, so that's 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. This one's gonna leave right away, so it's still 125 minutes.

First, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. I know there's 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So that's 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Now, we multiply that by 4, 'cause we got 4 hours. That's 3600 x 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, each spring makes 1 jellyfish per second, so in 14400 seconds, one spring makes 14400 jellyfish. But we got 5 springs, so we multiply 14400 by 5. That's 14400 x 5 = 72000.

We know they got 100 feet together, so we can say x + (x + 60) = 100. That's like sayin' Sam's part plus Harry's part equals 100.

Now, I'm not too good at them fancy math things, but I think I can do this. If we add x and x, that's like 2x. And then we add 60, so it's 2x + 60 = 100.

Now, if we take away 60 from both sides, that's like subtractin' 60 from 100, and that leaves us with 40. So we got 2x = 40.

The big one's 300 feet long, and people go down it at 60 feet a minute. So, I'm thinkin', if you divide 300 by 60, that's like, 5 minutes. 

The other one's 240 feet, and people go down it at 80 feet a minute. So, I do the same thing, 240 divided by 80, that's 3 minutes.

Now, I gotta figure out how much longer the big one takes. So, I subtract 3 from 5, and that's 2 minutes.

"Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks, so that's 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes a day. That's 1 hour a day. He does that for 5 days, so that's 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. We know Amber ran 8 miles. Now, Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber did. That's a lotta miles. 

So, Micah's miles is 3.5 times 8. That's... um... 28 miles. 

Now, we add up the miles Amber and Micah ran. That's 8 + 28 = 36 miles. 

We know they all ran 52 miles together. So, Ahito's miles is 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"So Sheila bought some stuff for 85 bucks, then she took somethin back that cost 15 bucks. That means she owes 85 - 15 = 70 bucks.

Then she bought a fryin pan that was on sale. It was 20 bucks, but it was 20% off. I think that means she got 20% of 20 bucks off, which is like 4 bucks. So the pan cost her 20 - 4 = 16 bucks.

She also bought some towels that were 30 bucks, but they were 10% off. I think that's like 3 bucks off. So the towels cost her 30 - 3 = 27 bucks.

So she spent 16 + 27 = 43 bucks on the new stuff. Add that to the 70 bucks she already owed, and she owes 70 + 43 = 113 bucks now.

"I think I can figger this out. So, we got a bunch of jellyfish in a tank, and some of 'em change color under a special light. Now, I know that 6 of 'em changed color, and that's a third of the big ones. So, if 6 is a third, then we gotta multiply that by 3 to get the total number of big jellyfish. That's 6 x 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

Now, I also know that the big jellyfish are a fifth of all the jellyfish in the tank. So, if 18 is a fifth, then we gotta multiply that by 5 to get the total number of jellyfish. That's 18 x 5 = 90 jellyfish.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, Lauren wants to save up for when she's older, and she wants to live on 40% of what she makes now, which is $100,000. That's $40,000 a year. She wants to do that for 20 years, so she'll need:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Now, she's saving 20% of her paycheck, which is $20,000 a year. To find out how many years it'll take her to save $800,000, I'll divide that by how much she saves each year:

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save up enough. But the question asks how many more years she needs to work, and I don't know how long she's been working already. If she just started, then she needs to work for 40 years.

The final answer is: 40"
"I think I can figger this out. Marty's got 100 centimeters of ribbon and he's gotta cut it into 4 equal parts. That's like dividin' a pizza into 4 slices. So, 100 divided by 4 is... um... 25. That's how long each of them parts is.

Now, he's gotta cut each of them parts into 5 equal parts. That's like cuttin' each slice of pizza into 5 little pieces. So, 25 divided by 5 is... 5.

240 / 40 = 6

Now, I'll multiply 6 by 100, that's like addin' 6 together 100 times.
6 * 100 = 600

So, there's 600 kids in the school. If 240 are boys, I'll subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls.
600 - 240 = 360

Add 'em together, we get 12 + 6 = 18 inches. Now, we gotta divide that by how many ladies we got, which is 6. So, 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. That's a lot of walkin'. If she hikes twice a day, that's 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day. Then, if she hikes twice a day, that's 310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike.

She's plannin' to hike 125 miles each time, but that ain't enough. She needs to hike more. Let's see... 155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles. So, she needs to hike 30 more miles each time.

Next, I'm gonna do the same for the blue balls. That's 11 balls times 5 bucks, so that's 55 bucks.

Last, I'm gonna do the green balls. That's 25 balls times 3 bucks, so that's 75 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So Pierre, Paul, and Jacques got 12 kg of apples. Now, Pierre wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants a third. 

A quarter is like, when you cut somethin' into four pieces, you take one piece. So, 12 kg cut into four pieces is 3 kg each. Pierre wants one of them pieces, so that's 3 kg.

A third is like, when you cut somethin' into three pieces, you take one piece. So, 12 kg cut into three pieces is 4 kg each. Paul wants one of them pieces, so that's 4 kg.

Now, they took 3 kg and 4 kg, that's 7 kg. They started with 12 kg, so if they took 7 kg, that leaves 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"I work in a factory, so I know a thing or two about gettin' stuff done. Let's break this down. We got 5 workers, and we need 400 toys. 2 of 'em make 6 toys an hour, and the other 2 make 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, but we still need 20 more toys.

First, let's see how many toys the first 4 workers made. The 2 fast ones made 6 toys an hour, so that's 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys. The other 2 made 4 toys an hour, so that's 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys. That's a total of 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

We need 400 toys, but we still need 20 more, so we must've made 400 - 20 = 380 toys so far. The first 4 workers made 200, so the 5th worker must've made 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Now, we just need to figure out how many toys the 5th worker makes per hour. We know they worked for 10 hours, so we divide 180 toys by 10 hours. That's 180 ÷ 10 = 18 toys per hour.

Now, I add 'em all up. Elijah's first dog is 15, his second dog is 30, and Kory's dog is 60. That's 15 + 30 + 60.

Let's start with Camden and Sarah. If Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, and they did 30 together, we can say Sarah did some number, and Camden did that number plus 12. So, if we add those two numbers, we get 30. 

Let's say Sarah did 9 eggs. Then Camden did 9 + 12 = 21 eggs. That adds up to 30, so that's right.

Now, we know Camden and Sarah did 30 eggs, and the total is 56. So, Arnold and Madeline did 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they did the same number, they each did 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, let's see how many more eggs Camden did than Arnold. Camden did 21, and Arnold did 13. So, Camden did 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Now, let's find the weight of the crayons. That's 200 crayons times 1 ounce per crayon, which is 200 ounces. And the weight of the boxes is 25 boxes times 8 ounces per box, which is 200 ounces.

Addin' those together, I get 200 ounces for the crayons and 200 ounces for the boxes, which is 400 ounces. Now, I know there's 16 ounces in a pound, so I gotta divide 400 by 16. That's 25.

Now, if she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, that means she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk. So, it takes her 10 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

To find the total time, we add the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk. That's 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Let's say the hot mug is x degrees. When he mixes 4 ounces of the cold water (33 degrees) with 1 ounce of the hot water (x degrees), it's gotta be at least 40 degrees. 

I'm thinkin' it's like makin' a mix of stuff. If you got 4 parts of one thing and 1 part of another, you gotta think about how they mix together. So, the cold water's 4 parts, and the hot water's 1 part. 

If we do the math, it's like this: (4 x 33 + 1 x x) / 5 = 40. That's like sayin' 4 times 33, plus 1 times x, all divided by 5, is equal to 40. 

Now, let's do the math: 132 + x = 200. That's 'cause 4 times 33 is 132, and we're addin' x to that. Then we gotta get to 200, 'cause that's 5 times 40.

So, if we subtract 132 from both sides, we get x = 68. That means the hot mug's gotta be at least 68 degrees.

Milkie Cows brings 20 cows a day, and Broilers brings 10 chickens a day. They do this for 3 weeks, which is 21 days. 

So, for the cows, we gotta multiply 20 cows a day by 21 days. That's 20 x 21 = 420 cows. Then we add that to the 50 cows he already had, so that's 420 + 50 = 470 cows.

For the chickens, we multiply 10 chickens a day by 21 days. That's 10 x 21 = 210 chickens. Then we add that to the 20 chickens he already had, so that's 210 + 20 = 230 chickens.

Now, each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs is 4 x 9, which is 36 bagels. So he's payin' 36 bucks for 36 bagels. That's like, 36 / 36, which is 1 buck per bagel.

Let's say the number of groups of 5 men and 9 women is x. Then, the total number of people is 5x + 9x = 14x. We know this is equal to 84, so we can set up an equation: 14x = 84.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 14: x = 84 / 14 = 6.

Now, we know there are 6 groups of 5 men and 9 women. So, the total number of women is 9 * 6 = 54.

If 20 women get off the bus, the number of women left is 54 - 20 = 34.

Now, let's look at the bouquets. He made $56 from bouquets in a day, and each bouquet is $8, so he sold $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets in a day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that's 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers in bouquets per day. For 3 days, that's 84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers.

He spent $100, but only made $84. That means he's out $16.

"I think I can figger this out. Lauren's got a big job to do, makin' lots of pictures. She can do 5 big ones, 6 medium ones, or 7 little ones in a day.

First, let's see how many days for the big ones: 45 big pictures / 5 big pictures a day = 9 days
Then, the medium ones: 36 medium pictures / 6 medium pictures a day = 6 days
And last, the little ones: 49 little pictures / 7 little pictures a day = 7 days

So, it's gonna take her the most days to do the big pictures. That's 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"

First, I gotta add up all them miles. 110 + 140 is 250 miles. That's how far he went. 

Then I gotta add up all them hours. 2 + 3 is 5 hours. That's how long it took him.

Now, I think I remember somethin' about speed. Speed is like how far you go divided by how long it takes, right? So I'ma do that. 

250 miles / 5 hours = 50

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two lottery tickets. One's got a 20% chance of winin', and the other one's three times more likely to win. That means the second ticket's got a 60% chance of winin', right? 

Now, I think we gotta multiply them numbers together to find out what chance we got of both tickets winin'. So that's 20% times 60%. I'm not too good at math, but I think that's 0.2 times 0.6, which is 0.12. 

To make that a percentage, we gotta multiply it by 100, so that's 12%.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. They're gonna split 'em up equal, so we gotta divide by 3. That's 60 / 3 = 20.

He sells 'em for 40 bucks each, so that's 6 x 40 = 240 bucks.

We gotta make enough for 2300 people, so that's 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles. We already make 4200, so we need 11500 - 4200 = 7300 more bottles.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

So we add 'em all up: 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37. That's a lotta B's. Let me try to simplify it. That's like 6B + 7 = 37.

Now, I'm gonna subtract 7 from both sides. That gives me 6B = 30.

Next, I'm gonna divide both sides by 6. That gives me B = 5.

Now that I know B, I can find the red rope. The red rope is 4B, so it's 4 x 5 = 20.

20% more pods means you gotta add 20% of 100 to 100. I think that's like, 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, if the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods, that's like, $12 divided by 120 pods. That's 10 cents per pod.

If I use 1 pod per cycle, and I wanna know how many cycles I can run for $1, I just divide $1 by 10 cents. That's like, 10.

He used half of those to pay a bill, so he's got 40 / 2 = 20 bills left. Each bill is 20 bucks, so he's got 20 * 20 = 400 bucks.

Then he tripled his money, so now he's got 400 * 3 = 1200 bucks. Now he wants 5 dollar bills, so we gotta divide 1200 by 5. That's 1200 / 5 = 240.

Now, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. That's 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day. I think I can divide 2.75 by 1 to see how many days he's got left. That's 2.75 days.

But wait, the teacher can't use the chalk if it's smaller than 2 inches. So I gotta see how many days it'll take to get to 2 inches. He's got 2.75 inches left and he uses 1 inch per day. I'll subtract 2 from 2.75 to see how much more he's gotta use. That's 0.75 inches. I'll divide that by 1 and I get 0.75 days.

I think I can use the chalk for 2 days and then I'll have 2 inches left. On the third day, I'll use 1 inch and I'll have 1 inch left, which is too small. So I can use the chalk for 2 days before it's too small.

Now, in 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. And that's a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can say C + 25 = (1/3) * 5(C + 7).

I'm not too good with them fancy math things, but I'll try to simplify it. I'll multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 3C + 75 = 5C + 35.

"So May got her hair cut and colored. The colorin' cost 40 bucks. The haircut cost 30 bucks per inch. She had 10 inches of hair and now she got 8, so they cut off 2 inches. That's 2 times 30, which is 60 bucks. Add that to the 40 for the color, and that's 100 bucks.

"Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. That's 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours a week. She gets paid $1.5 an hour. So in a week, she makes 45 * $1.5 = $67.5. Since there's 4 weeks in April, she makes 4 * $67.5 = $270. She also gets $10 a week for showin' up every day, so that's 4 * $10 = $40. Add that to her pay, and she gets $270 + $40 = $310.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Jason made. He got paid for doin' some chores. 

He got 50 cents for emptyin' the dishwasher. He did that 6 times, so that's 6 x 50 cents. I think that's 3 bucks. 

He got 3 bucks for doin' his laundry. He did that once. 

He got 75 cents for takin' out the trash. He did that twice, so that's 2 x 75 cents. I think that's a buck fifty. 

He got a buck fifty for cleanin' his room. He did that once. 

Now, let's add it all up: 3 bucks for the dishwasher, 3 bucks for laundry, a buck fifty for the trash, and a buck fifty for cleanin' his room. That's 3 + 3 + 1.50 + 1.50. I think that's 9 bucks.

"I'm just a regular fella, but I'll try my best to figure this out. So, we gotta count how many people went to The Best Cookeries Around restaurant that day.

First, 50 people came in the morning. That's a good start. Then, 40 more people came in at 10:00. That's 50 + 40, which is 90.

After that, twice as many people as the ones who came in at 10:00 showed up. That's 2 times 40, which is 80. So now we got 90 + 80, that's 170.

Finally, 3 times as many people as the ones who came in the morning came in the evening. That's 3 times 50, which is 150. So we add that to 170, and we get 320.

"Alain's mom got 5 packs of red pens. Each pack got 5 pens, so that's 5 x 5 = 25 red pens. Now, she got twice as many black pens as red pens. So, she got 2 x 5 packs of black pens, that's 10 packs. Each pack got 5 pens, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 black pens. Now, add 'em up, 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

Now, 20 bottles of cognac at 90 bucks a bottle is 20 * 90, that's 1800 bucks. He already spent 600 on scotch, so add that to 1800, that's 2400 bucks.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Mr. Julius planted some trees, right? He planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. Then he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 2 times 20, which is 40. That's a lotta trees! So on the first day, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. Then he planted some more Lodgepole Pine trees, 1/4 more than the first day. I think that's like 1/4 of 40, which is 10. So he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. That's a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

Now, let's add 'em all up. He planted 60 trees on the first day and 80 trees on the second day. That's 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

So, four times x is 4x. Then we add 8 to that, and it's 4x + 8. That's equal to 40. Now, I gotta get x by itself. I'll subtract 8 from both sides, so it's 4x = 40 - 8. That's 4x = 32.

Now, I'll divide both sides by 4, so x = 32 / 4. That's x = 8.

First, we gotta find out how many got red stripes. I think I learned somethin' about thirds in school, so I'm gonna divide 66 by 3. That's 22 fish with red stripes.

Now, we gotta find out how many got blue stripes. We gotta take away the 22 fish with red stripes from the total, so that's 66 - 22 = 44 fish left.

Then, I gotta find 5/11 of 44. I'm not real good at fractions, but I think I can do it. I'm gonna multiply 44 by 5, and then divide by 11. That's 220 / 11 = 20 fish with blue stripes.

Then Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors. Now she's got 18 - 3 = 15 colors from them makeup sets.

So, Amy's got 4 colors from them eyeshadow thingies and 15 colors from them makeup sets. That's 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

Now, the first floor's ceiling is 3 times as high as Mattison. So that's 60 times 3... that's 180 inches. That's how high the first floor is.

So if the whole house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, I can subtract 180 from 420 to find out how high the roof is from the second floor. That's... 420 minus 180... that's 240 inches.

Now, I know they all need to walk a total of 12 miles 'cause that's 3 miles per dog and there's 4 dogs. So if the first three dogs need 8 miles, the last one needs... um... 12 - 8, which is 4 miles.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide 432 by 0.15 to get the total number of jelly beans. That's a lot of math, but I think I got it... 2880 jelly beans.

Now, they said 30% of 'em are red, so we multiply 2880 by 0.3, which is 864. That's how many red jelly beans I think are in the jar.

But they told us the real answer is 900. So, I was off by... 900 minus 864, which is 36.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, we got a bus with 200 seats, and it starts with 20 people. Then, 40 more people get on at the first stop. That's 20 + 40 = 60 people now.

Next, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop get on at the second stop. That's 3/4 of 40, which is... um... 30 people. So now we got 60 + 30 = 90 people.

Then, at the third stop, the number of people doubles. That means we got 90 * 2 = 180 people now.

The bus can hold 200 people, and we got 180 people. So, to fill the rest of the seats, we need... 200 - 180 = 20 people.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and it costs her 2 bucks each time. That's 2 * 3 = 6 bucks a year. She does this for 5 years, so that's 6 * 5 = 30 bucks.

Then the price goes up. It's 2 bucks plus half again, so that's 2 + 3 = 5 bucks a visit. She still goes 3 times a year, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 bucks a year. She does this for 3 more years, so that's 15 * 3 = 45 bucks.

So, if I add it all up, she spent 30 + 45 = 75 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So, we got 4 grades, and each grade got 10 kids who get to try the escape room. That's 4 x 10 = 40 kids. Now, only 8 kids can go in at a time, so we gotta divide 40 by 8. That's 5 groups. Each group gets 45 minutes, so we multiply 5 x 45. That's 225 minutes.

The answer is: 225"
"I'm a carpenter, so I know how much stuff costs. John made 4 tables for $20 each, that's 4 x $20, that's $80. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, that's 2 x $10, that's $20. So Ali gotta pay John $80 for the tables and $20 for the roof frames. That's $80 + $20, that's $100.

"I think I can figger this out. Ian's got a board that's 40 feet long, and he's gonna cut it into two pieces. One piece is gonna be 4 times longer than the other. Let's say the short piece is x. Then the long piece is 4x.

We know the whole board is 40 feet, so the two pieces gotta add up to 40. That means x + 4x = 40.

I remember my buddy taught me that when you got the same thing on both sides of the + sign, you can just add 'em together. So x + 4x is like 5x. Now we got 5x = 40.

My buddy also taught me that if you got a number times a letter, you can get rid of the number by dividin' both sides by that number. So if we divide both sides by 5, we get x = 8.

Now that we know the short piece is 8 feet, we can find the long piece. It's 4 times 8, which is 32.

"Aiden's makin' them meatballs for the cookout. He needs 2 tablespoons of that secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. He gets 16 meatballs from each pound. He wants 80 meatballs, so we gotta figure out how many pounds of meat he's gonna use.

I think if he gets 16 meatballs from a pound, and he wants 80, we can divide 80 by 16. That's like, 5. So he's gonna use 5 pounds of meat.

Now, he needs 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound, so we multiply 5 by 2. That's 10. He's gonna need 10 tablespoons of that secret seasoning.

"I'm pretty good at figuring stuff out. So, Luke's got 5 windows, and each one's 35 inches wide. He needs fabric that's 2 times the total width of all the windows. 

First, I gotta find the total width. That's 5 x 35, which is 175. Now, I gotta multiply that by 2. That's 175 x 2, which is 350. 

So, Luke needs 350 inches of fabric."
"I'm gonna figure out how much that phone call costs. So, it's 25 cents a minute for the first 16 minutes. That's like, a quarter for each minute. So, 16 minutes is 16 x 25 cents, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...$4.

Then, after 16 minutes, it's 20 cents a minute. I got 36 minutes total, so I subtract 16 from that, and that's 20 minutes left. 20 minutes x 20 cents is... *counts on fingers again* ...$4.

So, I add the two together, $4 + $4, and that's... *counts on fingers once more* ...$8.

The final answer is: $8"
"It rained 2 inches on Monday. Now, I gotta figure out how much it's gonna rain on Tuesday. They said it's gonna rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total. So, I'm thinkin', twice of 2 is 4, and then I add 1 more. That's 5 inches.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Carly's makin' cupcakes and brownies for her class. She's got 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats. That's 5 x 2 = 10 treats in total.

Now, let's say she made 'c' cupcakes. She made 2 less than 3 times as many brownies as cupcakes, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

We know she made a total of 10 treats, so cupcakes plus brownies is 10. That's c + (3c - 2) = 10.

I'm not too good at them fancy math problems, but I'll give it a shot. If I add c and 3c, that's 4c. Then I subtract 2, so it's 4c - 2 = 10.

Now, I'll add 2 to both sides, so that's 4c = 12. Then I'll divide both sides by 4, so that's c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"So, Karen wants a manicure and a pedicure, and they cost $35 and $40. That's $75 total. But the salon gives 20% off if you get both, so that's like gettin' 20 cents off every dollar. So, 20% of $75 is... um... that's like 20 groups of 75 cents, which is $15. So, $75 minus $15 is $60.

Now, she wants nail art on each finger, and that's 10 fingers. Each one costs $3, so that's 10 times $3, which is $30.

So, addin' the manicure, pedicure, and nail art, that's $60 + $30, which is $90.

Then she's got one that comes 6 times a year, that's just 6.

And then she's got another one that comes 4 times as much as the 6 one, so that's 4 x 6, that's 24.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So the toy was 40 bucks in November. Then in December, it went up by 80%. That's a big jump. I think I can do that math. If it went up by 80%, that's like addin' 80% of 40 to 40. So 80% of 40 is like... um... 40 x 0.8 = 32. So it went up by 32 bucks. Now it's 40 + 32 = 72 bucks.

Then in January, it went down by 50%. That's like takin' 50% of 72 away from 72. 50% of 72 is... um... 72 x 0.5 = 36. So it went down by 36 bucks. Now it's 72 - 36 = 36 bucks.

Now, if she does this for 5 weeks, that's $47 x 5 = $235.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So John's got a new hobby, talkin' fast. He used to talk at 150 words per minute, but now he's 2.5 times faster. That's like, a lotta words.

So, his new speed is 2.5 x 150 = 375 words per minute. That's how fast he can talk now.

Now, we gotta figger out how long it'll take him to talk 10 pages. Each page got 450 words, so that's 10 x 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we divide the total words by how fast he can talk: 4500 / 375 = 12.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Conor went to the beach and saw some people. On the first day, he saw 50 people. The next day, there were 20 more people, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people. Then on the third day, it's like, double the people from the day before, so that's 2 x 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up them numbers: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people. That's how many people Conor saw in the first three days.

For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day, and that's 4 days, so that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

Now, I'm gonna add them numbers together: 260 + 240 = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"Alright, lemme think this through. Garrett's got a pan of kernels, and they're poppin' like crazy. 

First 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. That's a good start. Then, the next 30 seconds, it's like a kernel explosion - three times as many as the first 30 seconds. That's 3 x 20, which is 60. 

Now we're at 20 + 60, that's 80 kernels so far. Next 30 seconds, it's like the kernels are on fire or somethin', poppin' four times as fast as the first 30 seconds. That's 4 x 20, which is 80. 

So now we got 80 + 80, that's 160 kernels. Last 30 seconds, it slows down a bit, but still poppin' like crazy - half as many as the last 30 seconds. That's 80 / 2, which is 40. 

Now we're at 160 + 40, that's 200 kernels. But wait, there's more! After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, some kernels still pop from the leftover heat. It's like a quarter of the last 30 seconds, so that's 40 / 4, which is 10. 

Alright, addin' all that up, we got 200 + 10, that's 210 kernels.

"So, Tim's makin' lemonade for a party. He needs 1 cup of lemon juice for every gallon. And it takes 6 lemons to get 1 cup of juice. He's makin' 4 gallons, so that's 4 cups of juice. That's 4 x 6 = 24 lemons.

Now, his friend wants an extra gallon, but it's gotta be twice as tart. That means it needs twice as much lemon juice, so that's 2 cups. And that's 2 x 6 = 12 lemons.

So, Tim needs 24 lemons for the regular lemonade and 12 lemons for the extra tart one. That's 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

"I work at the Kennel house, takin' care of them dogs. We got 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Now, I know how much food they eat. German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms a day, and Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms a day.

So, German Shepherds eat 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms a day. Bulldogs eat 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms a day. That's 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms a day for all the dogs.

Now, we need to know how much they eat in a week. A week's got 7 days, so we multiply 21 by 7. That's 147 kilograms.

Now, we know there's 32 blocks in total. We can count the blue and yellow ones, that's 4 + 8, which is 12. So, if we take 32 and subtract 12, that's how many red ones there are.

So, Gary bought the boat for 9000 bucks. Then it went down 30% the first year. That's like, 30% of 9000, which is... um... 2700. So now it's worth 9000 - 2700 = 6300.

Next year, it goes down another 30%. That's 30% of 6300, which is... uh... 1890. So now it's worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410.

Last year, it goes down 20%. That's 20% of 4410, which is... hmm... 882. So now it's worth 4410 - 882 = 3528.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189. That's how many red, orange, and yellow ones we got. To find out how many pink ones there are, we gotta subtract that number from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"So Helen went to Germany and stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. That's 3 times 80 bucks, which is 240 bucks. Then she rode the bus 7 times. I think the bus ride is like 10% of the hotel price, so that's 80 bucks times 0.1, which is 8 bucks per ride. She rode 7 times, so that's 7 times 8 bucks, which is 56 bucks. Now, add the hotel and bus money together, that's 240 plus 56, which is 296 bucks.

Now, they got 2 popcorns, and them's $3 each. That's 2 x $3, which is... $6.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage is 250 pounds, and the two kids are 75 pounds each. So that's 75 + 75, that's 150 pounds for the kids. Now add it all up: 1200 + 250 + 150, that's 1600 pounds.

Now, I think I remember somethin' about percentages. 1% is like, a tiny bit, right? So we gotta find 1% of 1600. I think that's like, 1/100, so we multiply 1600 by 0.01. That's... um... 16.

I remember my buddy's a carpenter, and he told me that to find the total length of stuff you need to go around somethin', you gotta add up all the sides. So we gotta add 20 + 20, 'cause there's two long sides, and 15 + 15, 'cause there's two short sides. That's like this:

20 + 20 = 40
15 + 15 = 30

Now, we gotta figure out how much they eat in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter got 300 pounds of feed, so we subtract 280 from 300. That's 300 - 280 = 20.

He's got 40 screws, so I'll subtract the screws he needs from the screws he's got: 40 - 32 = 8.

"I think I can figger this out. If we got 10 eggs in one basket, and the other basket got twice as many, that means the other basket got 10 x 2 = 20 eggs. Now, if we put 'em together, we gotta add 'em up. So, 10 + 20 = 30.

"Alright, lemme think this through. Alexandra got 430 bucks, and Kim got 320 more than that. So Kim got 430 + 320, that's 750. Then there's Maryam, she got 400 more than Sarah, and Sarah got 300. So Maryam got 300 + 400, that's 700. Now, let's add all that up: 430 + 750 + 700 + 300.

That's a lotta numbers, but I think I got it... 430 + 750 is 1180, then add 700, that's 1880, and then add 300, that's 2180.

"I think I can figger this out. So, Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron. That means Aaron ran half of what Vanessa did, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now, it says Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, that's 8 minutes per mile. If Vanessa runs half as fast, that's 16 minutes per mile.

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so that's 4 x 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"I work on the docks, so I know a thing or two about lines. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. We got 200 feet of dock, so that's a lotta line. I do the math in my head: 200 x 3 is 600. That's how much line we need. But we already got 6 feet, so we don't need that much. I subtract 6 from 600, that's 594.

"So, Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. They order 2 meals for 5 bucks each, that's 10 bucks, and a 5 buck bottle of wine, so that's 15 bucks a reservation. We get 6 of those a night, so that's 6 times 15, which is 90 bucks a night.

Now, they're only open 2 days a week, so we gotta multiply 90 bucks by 2. That's 180 bucks a week.

"I sell watermelons for a livin'. I bought 50 of 'em for 80 bucks. I wanna make a 25% profit, so I gotta figure out how much to sell each one for.

First, I divide 80 by 50 to get the cost of one watermelon. That's 1.60 bucks. Now, I wanna make 25% more than that. I think of it like this: if I sell it for 1.60, I get 1.60. If I sell it for 2 bucks, that's 40 cents more. That's like a quarter of 1.60, so that's my 25% profit.

So, I sell each watermelon for 2 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, James is John's son, and he's twice as old as his sister Dora. Dora's gonna be 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now. That means James is 18, 'cause he's twice as old as her.

Now, John was 19 when James was born, so John's 18 + 19 = 37 years old now. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so that means the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, the youngest son's gonna be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"I think I can figger this out. Ana peels oranges faster than Jane. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one, and Jane takes 4 minutes. 

If they both peel for 60 minutes, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges. 

So, Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"I'm pretty good with numbers, so I'll give it a shot. 

Mark got a new radiator for 80% off, so that's like gettin' it for 20% of the price. The price was $400, so I gotta figure out 20% of that. I think that's like, 0.20 times $400, which is $80.

Then he hired a mechanic to put it in, and that cost $50 an hour. The mechanic worked for 3 hours, so that's $50 times 3, which is $150.

So, Mark paid $80 for the radiator and $150 for the mechanic, that's $80 + $150, which is $230.

"I reckon we got us a problem here. Farmer Brown's got 20 animals, and they're all either chickens or cows. Now, I know chickens got 2 legs and cows got 4 legs. Let's see... if we add up all the legs, we get 70.

I'm thinkin' we can start by guessin' how many cows we got. If we got a lot of cows, we'd have a lot of legs, 'cause they got 4 legs each. But if we got a lot of chickens, we'd have fewer legs, 'cause they only got 2 legs each.

Let's try somethin'. If we got 15 cows, that's 15 x 4 = 60 legs. That's a lot of legs, but we still need 10 more to get to 70. If we got 5 chickens, that's 5 x 2 = 10 legs. That's just what we need!

So, I reckon we got 5 chickens and 15 cows. That's 20 animals, and that's 70 legs.

The final answer is: 5"
"So we got 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. That's a lot of slices. To figure out how many slices each person gets, we gotta add up all the slices first. 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, that's 7 x 8 = 56 slices.

Now we gotta divide those slices between 4 people, that's Henry and his 3 friends. So we take 56 slices and divide by 4. That's 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
