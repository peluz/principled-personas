"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs. She eats 3 and uses 4 for muffins. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells each egg for $2. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs by the price: 9 eggs * $2 = $18.

"To make a robe, we need 2 bolts of blue fiber. We also need half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1. So we need 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, let's add the blue and white fiber together. 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. The repairs made the house worth 150% more than it was before. To find out how much the house is worth now, we need to figure out what 150% more than $80,000 is.

First, we need to find 100% of $80,000, which is just $80,000. Then we need to find 50% of $80,000, which is half of $80,000, or $40,000. Then we add $40,000 to $80,000 to get $120,000, and then add another $30,000 to get $150,000, but that is not correct.

"Carla is downloading a big file. It's 200 GB. She can download 2 GB in 1 minute. 

First, Carla downloads some of the file. She gets 40% of it. To find 40% of 200, we multiply 200 by 0.4. That's 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB in 1 minute, we divide 80 by 2. That's 40 minutes.

Then, the computer restarts. That takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla has to start the download again. She has to download the whole 200 GB. We divide 200 by 2. That's 100 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes together. 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"John drove 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply 3 hours by 60 miles per hour. 
3 * 60 = 180 miles

Then he turned around and got stuck in traffic for 2 hours. He didn't move, so that's 0 miles.

After that, he drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply half an hour by 30 miles per hour. 
0.5 * 30 = 15 miles

Then he drove for 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply 1.5 hours by 80 miles per hour. 
1.5 * 80 = 120 miles

Now we add up the miles he drove after he turned around. 
15 + 120 = 135 miles

Now we subtract the miles he drove after he turned around from the miles he drove before he turned around. 
180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year it costs $3 to water and feed the tree. So, the total cost is $90 + $3 per year.

The tree grows 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, the total revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 + $3 = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63
Year 7: Total cost = $108 + $3 = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 + $3 = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 + $3 = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 + $3 = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105

"Melanie sold some vacuum cleaners. She sold 1/3 of them at the green house. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Now she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's say she had x vacuum cleaners at the start. She sold 1/3 of them at the green house, so she had 2/3 left. Then she sold 2 more, so she had 2/3 - 2 left. Then she sold half of that, so she had (2/3 - 2)/2 left.

We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can make an equation:
(2/3 - 2)/2 = 5 + 1
(2/3 - 2) = 12
2/3 = 14
2 = 42/3

"There are 20 students in the dance class. 20% of them chose contemporary dance. To find 20% of 20, I'll multiply 20 by 0.2. That's 4 students.

Now, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students left. 25% of them chose jazz dance. To find 25% of 16, I'll multiply 16 by 0.25. That's 4 students.

So, 4 students chose contemporary dance and 4 students chose jazz dance. That's 4 + 4 = 8 students. To find the number of students who chose hip-hop dance, I'll subtract 8 from 20. That's 20 - 8 = 12 students.

To find the percentage, I'll divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. That's (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 9 liters of orange drink left. To find 2/3 of 9, we can multiply 9 by 2 and divide by 3. 9 * 2 = 18, and 18 / 3 = 6. So, the orange drink has 6 liters of water.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. To find 3/5 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 3 and divide by 5. 15 * 3 = 45, and 45 / 5 = 9. So, the pineapple drink has 9 liters of water.

Marie bought a chicken meal for $12. She bought 5 packs of milk for $3 each. So, 5 x $3 is $15. She also bought 4 apples for $1.50 each. So, 4 x $1.50 is $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid $50 in total. So, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

"Marcy gets a pension for working a long time. If she works 40 years, she gets $50,000 a year. But she doesn't get that much if she quits early. 

If she quits after 20 years, she gets a little more each year. For every year after 20, she gets 5% more of the pension. 

Marcy quits after 30 years. So, she worked 10 years after 20 (30 - 20 = 10). She gets 5% more for each of those 10 years. 

5% x 10 = 50%

So, she gets 50% of the $50,000 pension. 

50% of $50,000 is $25,000.

"To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to figure out how many miles her car can go on one gallon of gas. Then we can multiply that by how many gallons her tank can hold.

We know Sophia drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas. So, we can divide the miles by the gallons to find out how many miles per gallon her car can go.

Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know her tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. So, we multiply the miles per gallon by the gallons in the tank.

Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

First, we need to find out how many days the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food. 
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for 180 days, so it eats 180 cups of dog food. 
The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for 185 days, so it eats 185 * 2 = 370 cups of dog food.

Now, we add the cups of dog food the puppy eats in the first year.

We can buy 2 flowers for $1, so we need 9 of those packages to get 18 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

"To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the number of roll-ups Beatrice and Marcell ate, then divide by 2.

Beatrice ate 2 rows of 24 roll-ups, so she ate 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups. 
Marcell ate 3 rows of 14 roll-ups, so he ate 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, let's add the roll-ups they ate: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 90 ÷ 2 = 45.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how far Julia rowed. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We also know the shore was 64 seconds away. 

First, let's find out how many feet she rows in 1 second. We can do that by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds.

20 feet ÷ 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we can find out how many feet she rowed in 64 seconds.

1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. So, we need to find out how many 10-foot parts are in 80 feet.

80 feet ÷ 10 feet = 8 parts

Now, we multiply the number of parts by 2 liters.

8 parts * 2 liters/part = 16 liters

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 pictures. Now, we know that's 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's picture. To find the number of ducks, we need to divide 300 by 50.

300 ÷ 50 = 6

"Sasha bought some lumber. She has 10 small boards and 5 big boards left. The small boards cost $10 each and the big boards cost $16 each.

First, let's find out how much she spent on the small boards. 10 small boards cost 10 x $10 = $100.
Then, let's find out how much she spent on the big boards. 5 big boards cost 5 x $16 = $80.
So, she spent $100 + $80 = $180 on all the boards.

Now, the price of lumber went up by 50%. That means she can sell them for 1.5 times what she paid. 
The small boards will sell for 10 x $10 x 1.5 = $150.
The big boards will sell for 5 x $16 x 1.5 = $120.
So, she can sell all the boards for $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we need to subtract what she spent from what she sold them for. 
Profit = $270 - $180
Profit = $90

Katy used 120 parts in total. We need to find out how many of those parts are sugar. We know that 7 out of 20 parts are sugar. So we can find out how many groups of 20 parts are in 120.

120 ÷ 20 = 6

Now we know there are 6 groups of 20 parts. We need to find out how many parts of sugar are in 6 groups. We know that 7 parts are sugar in 1 group. So we multiply 6 and 7.

There were 2 big boxes with 5 cars in each box. That's 2 x 5 = 10 cars. 

Then, more boxes came, and now there are 30 cars. We need to find out how many boxes came the next day.

First, we find out how many cars came the next day. We do this by taking the total number of cars (30) and subtracting the cars that were already there (10). That's 30 - 10 = 20 cars.

Now, we know each box has 5 cars. To find out how many boxes came the next day, we divide the number of cars that came the next day (20) by the number of cars in each box (5). That's 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

The number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. He got a 40% raise. To find 40% of $40,000, we multiply $40,000 by 0.4. 
$40,000 * 0.4 = $16,000
Then we add $16,000 to $40,000 to get Adrien's new salary.
$40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. To find Lylah's salary, we need to find the number that when increased by 30% equals $40,000. 
Let's try dividing $40,000 by 1.3 (1 + 0.3).
$40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769

Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. She also got a 40% raise. To find 40% of $30,769, we multiply $30,769 by 0.4.
$30,769 * 0.4 = $12,308
Then we add $12,308 to $30,769 to get Lylah's new salary.
$30,769 + $12,308 = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Now, let's add up what Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons: 4 x $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 x $15 = $300

Now, we multiply 0.4 hours by 500 people to get the total hours. That's 0.4 * 500 = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the hospital pays them 200 * $150 = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. So, the hospital gets 200 * $200 = $40,000.

Now, we need to find out how many fries were left. Let's say there were x fries in the pack. After Dave ate 14, there were x - 14 fries left. Then the seagull ate 7, so there were x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 fries left.

The pigeons ate 9 fries (3 pigeons x 3 fries each). So, there were x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 fries left.

The raccoon took 2/3 of the fries, and the ants took 1 fry, leaving 5 fries. Let's think about the raccoon and the ants. If the raccoon took 2/3, that means 1/3 was left. The ants took 1 fry, and 5 fries were left. So, 1/3 of the fries was 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we need to find x. If 1/3 of the fries is 6, then the total number of fries (x - 30) is 6 x 3 = 18. So, x - 30 = 18. To find x, we add 30 to both sides: x = 18 + 30 = 48.

The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months. 
So, he needs 700 bananas * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"Blake and Kelly are running on a football field. The field is 100 yards long. 

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. When you run back and forth, that's like running to the end and back. So, it's 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards. Blake does this 15 times, so that's 200 * 15 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. When you run to the 40-yard line and back, that's 40 yards + 40 yards = 80 yards. Kelly does this 34 times, so that's 80 * 34 = 2720 yards. Kelly also ran 200 yards, so we add that: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake ran more. To find out how much more, we subtract: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

After 26 months, it's $178.30 + 20% of $178.30, which is $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96.
After 28 months, it's $213.96 + 20% of $213.96, which is $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75.
After 30 months, it's $256.75 + 20% of $256.75, which is $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. We know that in 2 years, their ages will add up to 28.

So, we can write an equation: x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine the numbers: 3x + 4 = 28

Now, let's solve for x. If we subtract 4 from both sides, we get: 3x = 24

"To find out how long it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to add the time it takes to peel a potato and the time it takes to cut a potato.

It takes Billy 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel a potato. We can convert 30 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. 30 seconds is half a minute, so it's 0.5 minutes. So, peeling a potato takes 1 minute + 0.5 minutes = 1.5 minutes.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato. We can convert 5 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. 5 seconds is a little less than 6 seconds, and 6 seconds is 0.1 minutes, so 5 seconds is a little less than 0.1 minutes. Let's just say it's 0.08 minutes.

So, peeling and cutting a potato takes 1.5 minutes + 0.08 minutes = 1.58 minutes.

The next month, she got 20 fewer cards than the month before. So she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

The month after that, she got 2 times the cards she got in the first 2 months. In the first 2 months, she got 60 + 40 = 100 cards. So she got 2 x 100 = 200 cards. Now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. He edits the same number of sentences for two publishers. So, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents for each sentence. So, Mark gets 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. That's 5 * 2 = 10 cents for each sentence. Mark gets 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the money from both publishers. 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

First, let's find out how much more he makes each week with the 5% raise. 5% of $2000 is $100. So, he makes $2000 + $100 = $2100 a week now.

He works 52 weeks a year, so he makes $2100 * 52 = $109,200 a year.

He also got $5000, so we add that to his yearly pay: $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find the total score she needs to get an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert lets her remove the lowest score, we only need to think about 5 tests. 

To get an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 5. 
93 * 5 = 465

Now, let's add up the scores of her first 5 tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since she can remove the lowest score (71), we subtract 71 from 438. 
438 - 71 = 367

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs 40g. So, we multiply 25 by 40.

25 x 40 = 1000g

Now, let's find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, if a chocolate bar weighs 40g, a candied apple weighs half of that, which is 20g.

There are 80 candied apples, and each one weighs 20g. So, we multiply 80 by 20.

80 x 20 = 1600g

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to know how many cups we have. We have 20 dozen cups. Since 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 20 by 12. That's 240 cups.

Now, we need to know how much the cups cost. We know that the cups cost $1200 less than the plates. The plates cost $6000 each, and we have half a dozen plates. Half a dozen is 6. So, 6 * $6000 is $36000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from $36000. That's $34800. This is the cost of the cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide $34800 by 240. That's $145.

The jacket costs $30 and the shoes cost $20 each. Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, so that's 2 x $20 = $40. 

The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 and she earned $20 from babysitting. So, she has $10 + $20 = $30.

She still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara gets $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide $40 by $4.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Jerry has red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens give 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens give 5 eggs a day. Jerry gets 42 eggs every day.

We also know that Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens. Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens. Then, he has 'r + 2' white chickens.

Now, let's think about the eggs. The red chickens give 3 eggs each, so 'r' red chickens will give 3r eggs. The white chickens give 5 eggs each, so 'r + 2' white chickens will give 5(r + 2) eggs.

We know that Jerry gets 42 eggs in total. So, we can write an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now, let's solve this equation. First, we multiply 5 with (r + 2):

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Now, we combine the 'r's:

8r + 10 = 42

Next, we subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Finally, we divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how long Gary walks, we need to find the distance around the park. The park is a rectangle, so we need to add up all the sides. 

The park is 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. If we add the long sides together, that's 6 + 6 = 12 miles. If we add the short sides together, that's 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 miles. Now, we add those together: 12 + 3 = 15 miles.

Gary walks 3 miles in 1 hour. To find out how many hours he walks 15 miles, we need to divide 15 by 3. 

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, on the first two days, she counted 100 + 150 = 250 people.

Now, we know that by the third day, there were 500 people in total. To find out how many people she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the people she counted on the first two days from the total.

500 - 250 = 250

"Imagine you have two pools, and they both leak water. They leak 4 gallons every minute. 

Let's say the small pool had some water 4 minutes ago. We'll call that amount 'x'. The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so it had 2x.

Now, both pools leak 4 gallons every minute. After 4 minutes, they both lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water. 

So, the small pool now has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. The big pool has 4 times more water than the small pool now. We can write that as:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Let's solve this. 

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Add 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Now, subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

First, we need to find out how many students went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 0.3.

1000 * 0.3 = 300

So, 300 students went out through exit A. Now, we need to find out how many students are left.

1000 - 300 = 700

Now, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we can multiply 700 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(700 * 3) / 5 = 420

So, 420 students went out through exit B. Now, we need to find out how many students are left.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them. So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Kyle took 5, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Then, Ginger gave Griffin some fries. Let's say she gave him x fries. So, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

After that, Colby took 3 less than Kyle's 5 fries. Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 fries left.

We know Griffin had 27 fries in the end. So, (9 + x) - 2 = 27.

Let's solve for x. (9 + x) - 2 = 27
9 + x = 27 + 2
9 + x = 29
x = 29 - 9
x = 20

Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour. So, we multiply 120 hours by $250. That's 120 x 250 = $30,000.

But the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount. To find 10% of $30,000, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1. That's $30,000 x 0.1 = $3,000.

So, Jean got a discount of $3,000. To find out how much she paid, we subtract the discount from the total. That's $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half of what Chris has. Half of 6 is 3. So, Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11. So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we need to subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has. That's 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find out how much more the house costs than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the extra fees first. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply $350,000 by 0.05. That's $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply $350,000 by 0.12. That's $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price and the fees: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the house costs, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and the remaining loan. 

First, let's calculate the fees. The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000. To find 3% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.03. That's $12,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of $400,000. To find 5% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.05. That's $20,000.

Now, let's add the fees and the remaining loan amount. The total amount Mr. Tan paid is $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total amount he paid from the selling price. That's $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"To heat the oil to 300 degrees, it takes 20 minutes. Then it takes a bit longer to get to 400 degrees. 40% longer is like adding 40% of 20 minutes. 40% is like 40 out of 100, so it's like 40/100 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. It takes 5 minutes less to cook than to warm up the oil, so it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to do some math.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes 1/10 of that, which is 900 ÷ 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it's 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater has 1800 stitches. To find the stitches for the sleeves, we subtract 1170 from 1800: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

80 * 2 = 160
160 / 5 = 32

Now, we take away the cards with A from the total number of cards:
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we find the cards with B. We need to find 1/2 of 48. To do this, we can divide 48 by 2.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. If Sam is 'S' years old, then Ruby is 6S years old.

In 9 years, Sam will be S + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old. The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write this as an equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's solve this equation. First, we need to multiply 3 by (S + 9). This is like multiplying 3 by S and 3 by 9, and then adding them together. So it's:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, let's get all the S's on one side. We can do this by subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Now, let's get the S's all by themselves. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Now, let's divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles for 25 cents each. We can multiply 20 by 25 cents to get the total cost of the popsicles. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 25 cents is $0.25. So, 20 x $0.25 is $5.

Next, let's find the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars for 50 cents each. We can multiply 4 by 50 cents to get the total cost of the ice cream bars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 50 cents is $0.50. So, 4 x $0.50 is $2.

The ice cream used to cost $13, but now it costs $11. So, we save $2 on each ice cream. If we buy 2 ice creams, we save 2 x $2 = $4.

The milk is $0.5 cheaper. If we buy 4 packets of milk, we save 4 x $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"Helena's serum makes people grow extra arms and legs. 

Arms grow every 3 days. So, in 15 days, that's 15 ÷ 3 = 5 new arms.

Legs grow every 5 days. So, in 15 days, that's 15 ÷ 5 = 3 new legs.

So, the total new limbs will be 5 + 3 = 8.

"To find out how much money Theo has left to buy gifts, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find out how much he spent on suits. He bought 6 suits for $100 each. So, 6 x $100 = $600.

Then, he bought 3 suitcases for $50 each. So, 3 x $50 = $150.

Next, we need to find out how much his flight ticket cost. It cost $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit. A suit cost $100, so 5 x $100 = $500. Then we add $700, so $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we add up all the money he spent: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo had $6000 and he wants to save $2000. So, we subtract the money he spent and the money he wants to save from the total money he had: $6000 - $1950 = $4050, then $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

"There are 5 people in the family. 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. That's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. The other 2 people eat 2 eggs each day. That's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. So, they eat 9 + 4 = 13 eggs each day.

There are 7 days in a week. If they eat 13 eggs each day, they will eat 13 x 7 = 91 eggs in a week.

"To find the answer, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find out how old Noah was 6 years ago. We know Cera is 46 now, so 6 years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera 6 years ago, we need to divide 40 by 2. 40 / 2 = 20. So, Noah was 20 years old 6 years ago.

Now, we know the population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. So, we multiply 3000 by 20. 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

The problem says the population 6 years ago was half of what it is now. So, we need to multiply 60,000 by 2 to find the current population. 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"Let's break it down. We have 105 players in total. The offense has twice as many players as the defense. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense.

Let's say the defense has x players. Then the offense has 2x players, and the special teams have x/2 players.

We can add them up: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 210

Now, let's add the x's: 7x = 210

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 7: x = 210 ÷ 7
x = 30

So, the defense has 30 players.

"Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. Let's count them.

2 families with 6 people is 2 x 6 = 12
3 families with 4 people is 3 x 4 = 12
So, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

But some people can't come. 8 people are sick. And 1/4 of 8 people have other things to do. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, 8 + 2 = 10 people can't come.

Now, let's subtract the people who can't come from the people who were invited. 24 - 10 = 14

"Solomon had 50 marbles. He bought 20 more from his friend Johanna. So now he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His dad gave him some more marbles. The number of marbles his dad gave him is 2/5 of 20. To find 2/5 of 20, we can multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5. 20 * 2 = 40, and 40 / 5 = 8. So his dad gave him 8 marbles.

Now Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble. 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to figure out how many cubic feet of water it can hold. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool.

The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. So, we multiply these numbers together:
6 x 4 x 5 = 120

This means the pool can hold 120 cubic feet of water. Now, we need to find out how much it costs to fill it. It costs 10 cents for each cubic foot of water. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot:
120 x 0.10 = 12

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children. 
30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

"The problem says we need to find the number of electric poles. We know that for every 1 pole, we need 3 wires. We also know we need 45 wires. 

Imagine we have 3 groups of wires, and each group has the same number of wires. Since we have 45 wires in total, we can divide 45 by 3 to find out how many wires are in each group. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

So, each group has 15 wires. Since we have 1 pole for every 3 wires, and we have 3 groups of 15 wires, we need 1 pole for each group. 

We have 3 groups, so we need 3 poles, but we also need to remember that 3 groups of 15 wires is the same as 45 wires, and the ratio is 1 pole to 3 wires. So, we need to divide the 3 groups into 1 group of poles.

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are. The problem says they are 2/5 of the total number of employees. There are 100 employees, so we need to find 2/5 of 100. 

To do this, we can multiply 100 by 2 and then divide by 5. 100 x 2 = 200, and 200 / 5 = 40. So, there are 40 junior programmers.

Now, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. There are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers. So, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers get $2000 per month. To find the total amount they get, we multiply 40 by $2000. 40 x $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers, so they get $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. To find the total amount they get, we multiply 60 by $2400. 60 x $2400 = $144,000.

Now, we add the total amount junior programmers get and the total amount senior programmers get. $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

Let's work backwards. At the second stop, 8 people got in and 7 people got down. So, that's like 1 more person got in. Now we have 20 people, and we know that 1 more person got in at the second stop. So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people.

$350 + $350 + $350 + $350 + $350 + $350 = $2,100
Now, add the first payment: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
He pays $1,100 first, then $250 for 9 months. 
9 months is even more, so let's add it up: 
$250 + $250 + $250 + $250 + $250 + $250 + $250 + $250 + $250 = $2,250
Now, add the first payment: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's see which one is more expensive. 
$3,450 is more than $3,350. 
So, the difference is: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

"Maria bought 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. So she spent 8 x $8 = $64.

The price went up by 50% in the first year. That means it went up by half of $8, which is $4. So the new price is $8 + $4 = $12.

Then the price went down by 25% in the second year. That means it went down by a quarter of $12, which is $3. So the new price is $12 - $3 = $9.

Now Maria has 8 shares, and each share is worth $9. So the total value is 8 x $9 = $72.

"Imagine we have 3 groups of students. Two groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students. Let's call the number of students in the two big groups ""x"".

We know that the total number of students is 200. So, if we add the students in all 3 groups, it should be 200.

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

We can add the x's together: 3x - 10 = 200

Now, let's add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210

Next, we divide by 3: x = 70

So, the two big groups have 70 students each. The smallest group has 10 fewer students, which is 70 - 10 = 60.

"Farmer Brown has 60 animals. He has cows and chickens. Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's say he has some cows. If he has twice as many chickens, that means he has 2 times as many chickens as cows. If we add the number of cows and the number of chickens, we get 60.

So, if we say the number of cows is 20, then the number of chickens is 2 times 20, which is 40. 20 + 40 is 60, so that's right.

Now, let's count the legs. 20 cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 x 4 = 80 legs. 40 chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 x 2 = 80 legs. 

80 + 80 is 160.

"We have a pink frog, a blue beetle, a green toad, a yellow snake, and a red bird. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals:

12.8 x 5 = 64
64 ÷ 2 = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"There are 52 people in the choir. Half of them are girls, so we need to find half of 52. To do that, we can divide 52 by 2. 52 / 2 = 26. So, there are 26 girls.

But some of the girls can't come to the show. We need to find half of 26. 26 / 2 = 13. So, 13 girls can come to the show.

The teachers are also singing. There are 3 teachers. We need to add 13 girls and 3 teachers. 13 + 3 = 16.

We can add 5 + 6 to get 11. This is the total number of parts in the ratio.

We know they have 165 popsicles together. To find out how many popsicles each part is, we divide 165 by 11. 
165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now we know each part is 15 popsicles. Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15.

"Tim wants to know how much money he saves by not getting cable. He gets Netflix for $10. He also gets Hulu and Disney Plus, but they cost less because he gets them together. They usually cost $10 each, but he saves 20 cents on the dollar.

So, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 + $10 = $20. He saves 20 cents on the dollar, so that's 20 cents x 2 = 40 cents, or $4. Now, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding Netflix, he pays $16 + $10 = $26 for all his streaming services. His old cable cost $60. So, he saves $60 - $26 = $34.

Now, let's add the time she spent on the song. 
4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of time she spent editing. 
Percentage of time spent editing = (editing time / total time) * 100

Mel uses the air conditioner for 30 days. So, in 30 days, he uses 7.2 kilowatts * 30 days = 216 kilowatts.

Now, Mel wants to save energy. He will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day instead of 8 hours. That's 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts every day. We need to change watts to kilowatts again. 2700 watts is 2.7 kilowatts.

Mel uses the air conditioner for 30 days. So, in 30 days, he uses 2.7 kilowatts * 30 days = 81 kilowatts.

We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. We also know that there are 180 animals in total and 304 humps.

Imagine you have 2 humps for every camel and 1 hump for every dromedary. If you add up all the humps, you get 304. If you count all the animals, you get 180.

Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. We can make two equations:

1. c + d = 180 (because there are 180 animals)
2. 2c + d = 304 (because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

Now, let's solve these equations. If we subtract the first equation from the second equation, we get:
2c + d - (c + d) = 304 - 180
This simplifies to:
c = 124

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can find the number of dromedaries. We know that c + d = 180, so:
124 + d = 180

"Charlotte wants to buy some things from the store. She wants a set of pots and pans for $120, a set of bowls for $20, and 5 utensils for $5 each. 

First, we need to add up how much everything costs. 
- Pots and pans: $120
- Bowls: $20
- Utensils: 5 x $5 = $25
So, everything costs $120 + $20 + $25 = $165.

Now, the store is giving a 20% discount. That means we get 20% off the total price. To find 20% of $165, we multiply $165 by 0.20. 
$165 x 0.20 = $33

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price. 
$165 - $33 = $132

"Antoine's recipe needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to make more, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Onions cost $2.00 a pound. So, 4 x $2.00 = $8.00 for onions.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock. Each box costs $2.00. So, 2 x $2.00 = $4.00 for beef stock.

Now, we add the cost of onions and beef stock. $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup is for 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by 6. $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width. We know the length is 3 yards. There are 3 feet in a yard, so we multiply 3 yards by 3 feet to get the length in feet.

Length = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We also know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is length times width. So we divide the area by the length to get the width.

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now we know the length and width. The perimeter is the distance around the room. To find it, we add the length and width, then multiply by 2.

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet

40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, we know James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.

James took 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride. Jon took 80 minutes, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes for the whole triathlon.

Now, let's find out how long James took for the run. We know James took 36 minutes for the swim and 85 minutes for the bike ride. Let's subtract these from his total time:

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 for the plane tickets and $5400 for the hotel room. $10,000 + $5400 is $15,400.

"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half of that, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has 3 times that, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to know it's 3/4 of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

To find 3/4 of 48, we can multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 
48 * 3 = 144
144 / 4 = 36

So the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny.
36 + 48 = 84

"Keegan and Tashay need to raise $200 for baseball camp. They already have some money. Keegan has $83 and Tashay has $91. To find out how much they have together, we add their money: $83 + $91 = $174.

Now, we need to find out how much more they need. We subtract the money they have from the money they need: $200 - $174 = $26.

"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs to his player.

Now, let's see how many fewer songs Luri can add. We subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"Stetson ate some oranges and had to give up money for each one. He ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked 60 oranges. To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we need to find 2/5 of 60.

Imagine you have 60 cookies and you want to share 2/5 of them with your friend. You can divide the cookies into 5 groups. Then, give 2 groups to your friend. 

60 ÷ 5 = 12 cookies in each group
2 groups = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. He gave up $10 for each orange. To find the total amount of money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges by $10.

24 * $10 = $240

"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days. To find out how many miles he runs in a week, we need to multiply 12 miles by 5 days:
12 miles/day * 5 days = 60 miles

Now, we know James runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 10 miles in 1 hour. To find out how many hours he runs, we need to divide 60 miles by 10 miles/hour:
60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

"Uncle Ben has 4 horses. They eat 5 pounds of oats for each meal. He feeds them 2 times a day. So each horse eats 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of oats a day.

All 4 horses eat 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats a day. For 5 days, they will eat 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

One bag of oats is 50 pounds. So Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find two thirds of 27, we can multiply 27 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

27 * 2 = 54
54 / 3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, one third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find one third of 18, we can divide 18 by 3.

18 / 3 = 6

Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The average highest temperature is -10."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we need to subtract the money he already has from the cost of the toy car. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, we subtract $4 from $12. 

$12 - $4 = $8

Now, we know he needs $8 more. He saves $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take, we divide $8 by $2.

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

So, it will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount.

"Jaime has 2 trays and each tray can hold 24 eggs. So, we need to add 24 + 24 to find out how many eggs the trays can hold. 24 + 24 is 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs. We need to find out how many eggs won't fit. To do that, we subtract the number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs. So, we do 64 - 48.

64 - 48 is 16.

"Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but she gets one pack free. So she only pays for 1 pack. The pack she pays for costs $4.00. But she has a $2.00 coupon. So she pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Each pack has 4 razors. So 2 packs have 4 + 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we need to find out how much each razor costs. We divide the money she paid ($2.00) by the number of razors (8). 

$2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25

We need to convert this to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar. So we multiply $0.25 by 100.

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so the total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

In the morning, it costs him $6 each time. In the afternoon, it costs him $2 each time.

Let's count the morning rides. He drives 14 days, and each day he drives in the morning. So, that's 14 rides. Each ride costs $6. So, 14 x $6 is $84.

But wait, he drives twice a day. So, he drives 14 days, and each day he drives in the morning and in the afternoon. So, that's 14 x 2 = 28 rides in the morning. Each ride costs $6. So, 28 x $6 is $168.

Now, let's count the afternoon rides. He drives 14 days, and each day he drives in the afternoon. So, that's 14 rides. Each ride costs $2. So, 14 x $2 is $28.

Now, let's add the money he spent in the morning and in the afternoon. $168 + $28 is $196.

"Imagine you have two places to choose from for a party. One place costs $200 no matter how many friends come, but you have to buy food for $5 per friend. The other place costs $25 per friend, and the food is already included.

Let's say you have 'x' friends coming. The first place will cost $200 + $5 for each friend. The second place will cost $25 for each friend.

We want to find out how many friends it takes for both places to cost the same. So we make an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve it. We can subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Now, we divide both sides by 20:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Bodhi, David, and Lily found 43 insects together. We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found. Let's say Bodhi found some number of insects, and David found half of that.

If Bodhi found 36 insects, then David found half of 36, which is 18. Now we know Bodhi found 36 and David found 18.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David. David found 18, so Lily found 18 + 7 = 25.

Now, let's add up the number of insects each person found: Bodhi found 36, David found 18, and Lily found 25. 36 + 18 + 25 = 79, but that's not right. We know they found 43 insects together.

Wait, I made a mistake. If Bodhi found 36, David found 18, and they found 43 together, then Lily can't have found 25. Let me try again.

If Bodhi found 36, David found 18, and they found 43 together, then Lily found 43 - 36 - 18 = -11. But that's not right. You can't find a negative number of insects.

Let me try again. If David found half of what Bodhi found, and they found 43 together, then maybe Bodhi found 24 and David found 12. Then Lily found 43 - 24 - 12 = 7. But that's not right. We know Lily found 7 more than David.

If David found 12, then Lily found 12 + 7 = 19. But that's not right. We know they found 43 together.

Let me try again. If David found 10, then Lily found 10 + 7 = 17. And if Bodhi found 16, then David found half of 16, which is 8. But that's not right. We know David found 10.

If David found 10, then Bodhi found 20. And if Bodhi found 20, then David found half of 20, which is 10. And if David found 10, then Lily found 10 + 7 = 17.

Now, let's add up the number of insects each person found: Bodhi found 20, David found 10, and Lily found 17. 20 + 10 + 13 = 43, but that's not right. We know Lily found 17.

"Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To find out how much yarn they used, we need to know how many yards are in a skein. There are 364 yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of 364 yards. To find 1/4 of 364, we can divide 364 by 4. 364 ÷ 4 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of 364 yards. To find 1/2 of 364, we can divide 364 by 2. 364 ÷ 2 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum, and 1 pack of green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2. The green apple gum cost half of that, so it's $2 / 2 = $1.

The grape and green apple gum together cost $2 + $1 = $3. Suzie paid $7 in all. So, the 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4.

If 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $4, then 1 pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Let's see which one is cheaper. If we buy a 2 x 4, we get 200 sticks for $4. If we buy a 2 x 8, we get 400 sticks for $6. That's like getting 2 times more sticks for $2 more. So, the 2 x 8 is a better deal.

Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. We can divide $24 by $6. That's like sharing $24 into groups of $6. We get 4 groups.

If we multiply 4 groups by 400 sticks, we get 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"

Let's say he saves some money each day in the first 15 days. We can call this money 'x'. Then, in the last 15 days, he saves twice that money, which is 2x.

We know he wants to save a total of $1125. So, we add the money he saves in the first 15 days and the last 15 days. This should be equal to $1125.

The money he saves in the first 15 days is 15x. The money he saves in the last 15 days is 15 * 2x = 30x. 

Now, we add them together: 15x + 30x = 45x. This should be equal to $1125.

To find 'x', we divide $1125 by 45. This gives us x = $25.

That's like saying Brad's money plus Jeff's money equals 100 dollars. Now, let's add x and 4x together. That's 5x.

So now we have 5x = 100. To find out how much x is, we need to divide 100 by 5. That's 20.

So Brad gets 20 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times that. 4 times 20 is 80.

"Jeff walks to work and back home every day. His work is 3 miles away. So, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home. That's 3 + 3 = 6 miles every day.

He works 5 days a week. So, we need to multiply 6 miles by 5 days. That's 6 x 5 = 30 miles.

"Elise is writing the alphabet a lot of times. 

First, she writes the whole alphabet 2 times. The alphabet has 26 letters, so 2 times is 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

Then, she writes half of the alphabet. Half of 26 is 13.

After that, she writes everything she wrote before again. So she writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters again.

Now, we add all the letters: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

Total number of letters Elise has written:

"Imagine we have a big tree with lots of branches. Ali starts by calling 3 families. Then each of those 3 families calls 3 more families. That's like adding more branches to the tree.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
In the second round, those 3 families call 3 more each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 new families.
In the third round, those 9 families call 3 more each, so that's 9 x 3 = 27 new families.
In the fourth round, those 27 families call 3 more each, so that's 27 x 3 = 81 new families.

"Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. We need to find out how much he weighed before he got sick.

He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. So, we need to add 10 + 10 + 10 to find out how much he lost in total. 
10 + 10 + 10 = 30 pounds

We know Mark weighed 70 pounds after he got better. To find out how much he weighed before, we need to add the weight he lost to his weight after he got better.
70 pounds (weight after) + 30 pounds (weight lost) = 100 pounds

"So, James has 80 toys. We need to find out how many toys Jonathan has. To do that, we need to know how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times bigger than James's.

Five times 80 is 5 x 80 = 400. That's how many toys Jonathan needs. But he needs 2 more than he already has. So, if we subtract 2 from 400, we get the number of toys Jonathan has now.

400 - 2 = 398

Jonathan has 398 toys."
"To find out how much Daniel has to spend, we need to add up the cost of all the things he wants to buy.

5 notebooks cost 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
2 pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
1 calculator costs $12
1 geometry set costs $10

Let's add all these up: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8, then $8 + $12 = $20, and $20 + $10 = $30

The shop gives a 10% discount. To find 10% of $30, we can move the decimal point one place to the left and multiply by 10. So, 10% of $30 is $3.

Now, we subtract $3 from $30: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"Carly bought some food for her friends. She got 5 hamburgers for $4 each, 10 packs of fries for 30 cents each, and 5 cans of fruit drinks for $2 each.

First, let's find out how much the hamburgers cost. 5 x $4 is $20.
Then, let's find out how much the fries cost. 10 x 30 cents is $3.
Lastly, let's find out how much the fruit drinks cost. 5 x $2 is $10.

Now, let's add all the costs together. $20 + $3 + $10 is $33.

Carly paid with a $50 bill. To find out how much change she gets, we need to subtract $33 from $50. $50 - $33 is $17.

"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

I think the warm water time is the same as the hot water time. So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a hot day.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 x 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons have 4 holes each. 
14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons:

Now, let's add their weights together: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

105 / 1.5 = 70
70 * 2 = 140 / 1.5 = 93.33 pages, but we can't read a fraction of a page, so we will use this number and round down at the end.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

First, we need to find the area of the bedroom. The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet. To find the area, we multiply the length and width. 

18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The carpet costs $12 per square foot. So, the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The padding costs $2 per square foot. So, the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The old carpet needs to be removed. It costs $4 per square foot to remove it. So, the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The new carpet needs to be installed. It costs $34 per square foot to install it. So, the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, we add all the costs together: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"Maggie's oven is not working right. When she sets it to 450, it gets to 468. That's 18 degrees more. To find the percentage, I need to divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100.

0.04 x 100 = 4%

So, the oven is 4% too hot. Now, I need to find the number that is 4% less than 520. 

Let's say the number is x. Then, x + 4% of x is 520. 4% of x is 0.04x. So, x + 0.04x is 520.

x + 0.04x = 520
1.04x = 520

Now, I need to divide 520 by 1.04. 

520 ÷ 1.04 = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500.

Then we add the 30 minutes. 
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying it by 60. 
2 hours * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

"Pete needs contacts. He buys them in boxes. One box has 90 contacts. He can use them for 45 days. The box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off. That means he gets 10 dollars off. So, one box costs $100 - $10 = $90.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, he pays $90 * 2 = $180. He gets 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Now, we need to find out how much one pair of contacts costs. One pair is 2 contacts. So, we divide $180 by 180 contacts. That's $1 per contact. For 2 contacts, it's $1 * 2 = $2.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. That's 2 + 1 = 3 hours. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 hours. John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

They get $10 per hour. Jill worked 3 hours, so she gets 3 x $10 = $30. John worked 7 hours, so he gets 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned, we need to subtract Jill's money from John's money. That's $70 - $30 = $40.

"Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours and it burns 500 calories each hour. So, she burns 2 x 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She also runs for 1 hour and it burns 600 calories each hour. So, she burns 1 x 600 = 600 calories running.

Now, let's add the calories she burned doing aerobics and running. 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. To find out how many 200-calorie units she burned, we divide 1600 by 200. 1600 ÷ 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply 8 by 100 ml. 8 x 100 = 800 ml.

"Imagine we have a big jar of jelly beans. There are red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says there's 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. We have 4500 jelly beans in total.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is 100 (but it's not really 100, we just use it to make it easy). Then the number of red jelly beans is 99 (1% less than 100) and the number of green jelly beans is 101 (1% more than 100).

Now, we add them up: 99 + 100 + 101 = 300. But we have 4500 jelly beans, not 300. So we need to multiply each number by the same amount to get 4500. 

To find that amount, we divide 4500 by 300. 4500 ÷ 300 = 15. Now we multiply each number by 15.

Red jelly beans: 99 * 15 = 1485
Blue jelly beans: 100 * 15 = 1500
Green jelly beans: 101 * 15 = 1515

Now we find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans:

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds every week. So, in 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 + 1.75 + 1.75 + 1.75 + 1.75 = 8.75 pounds.

Now, let's see the difference. If he eats donuts, he will gain 8.75 pounds, and if he eats Cheerios, he will lose 6.25 pounds. So, the difference is 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

Now, we multiply the protein in each group (3 grams) by the number of groups (2). That's 3 * 2 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since John eats mushrooms every day, we need to multiply the protein he gets per day by 7 (the number of days in a week). That's 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein per week.

"There are 4 rows of seats in the auditorium. Each row has 18 seats. So, the total number of seats is 4 x 18 = 72.

Some seats were taken by the administrators. They took 1/4 of the seats. 1/4 of 72 is 18. So, 18 seats were taken by the administrators.

Now, there are 72 - 18 = 54 seats left. The parents took 1/3 of these seats. 1/3 of 54 is 18. So, 18 seats were taken by the parents.

Now, there are 54 - 18 = 36 seats left. These seats were taken by the students.

"James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each. The company bought those cars for 30% of $25,000. To find 30% of $25,000, we multiply $25,000 by 0.3. 

$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

So the company bought each car for $7,500. Now, we need to find the profit made on each car. The profit is the selling price minus the cost price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $25,000 - $7,500
Profit = $17,500

James sold 10 cars, so the total profit is 10 times the profit on one car.

Total profit = 10 * $17,500
Total profit = $175,000

James gets 10% of the total profit as commission. To find 10% of $175,000, we multiply $175,000 by 0.1.

Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

100 x 0.25 = 25

So, 25 people can stay upright. Now, we need to find out how many of them are women. We know that 60% of the people who can stay upright are women. To find 60% of 25, we can multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 x 0.6 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright. Now, we need to find out how many men can stay upright. We know that there are 25 people who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women. To find the number of men, we subtract 15 from 25.

First, we know the diamond jewel costs $2000. The gold jewel costs 4/5 of the diamond jewel. To find 4/5 of $2000, we can multiply $2000 by 4 and then divide by 5.

$2000 x 4 = $8000
$8000 ÷ 5 = $1600

So, the gold jewel costs $1600.

The silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. To find the price of the silver jewel, we subtract $400 from $1600.

$1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.

$2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver) = $4800

"John is taking a cooking class. He goes 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. He does this for 6 weeks. 

First, let's find out how many hours he goes to class in a week. 4 times a week * 2 hours each time is 8 hours a week. He does this for 6 weeks, so 8 hours a week * 6 weeks is 48 hours.

Now, John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide 48 hours by 1.5 hours. 

48 ÷ 1.5 = 32

Now, I will subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

Number of math teachers = 150 - 90

"Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of Aurelia's money. To find 3/4 of $120, we multiply $120 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

$120 * 3 = $360
$360 / 4 = $90

So Kassidy has $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

Now, let's add their money together: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total by 3: $360 / 3 = $120.

"To find out how many employees oversee the company, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find out how many employees are management. Since 20% of the employees are management, we need to find 20% of 50.

20% is the same as 20/100, so we can multiply 50 by 20/100. This is the same as multiplying 50 by 0.20.

50 * 0.20 = 10

So, 10 employees are management.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 10 employees oversee the company. Since only 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we need to find 30% of 10.

30% is the same as 30/100, so we can multiply 10 by 30/100. This is the same as multiplying 10 by 0.30.

10 * 0.30 = 3

"Let's solve this problem. 

Janey has 21 books. She has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. 

If Sally has 'x' books, then twice the number of books Sally has is 2x. Since Janey has 3 more than that, we can write it as 2x + 3.

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write an equation: 
2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for 'x'. If we subtract 3 from both sides, we get:
2x = 18

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches, we need to do some math.

First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is now in inches. Since it's 20 feet, and there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 20 by 12.

20 x 12 = 240 inches

Now, we need to find out how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We do this by subtracting 240 from 600.

600 - 240 = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide 360 by 30.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to figure out how much money Dylan and Frances invested first.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. To find 2/5 of $1200, we can multiply 2/5 by 1200. This is the same as 2 * (1/5 * 1200). 1/5 of 1200 is 240, and 2 * 240 is 480. So Dylan invested $480.

Now we need to find out how much money is left. We started with $1200, and Dylan invested $480. So we subtract 480 from 1200, which is 1200 - 480 = 720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is $720. To find 2/3 of 720, we can multiply 2/3 by 720. This is the same as 2 * (1/3 * 720). 1/3 of 720 is 240, and 2 * 240 is 480. So Frances invested $480.

Now we need to find out how much money is left again. We had $720, and Frances invested $480. So we subtract 480 from 720, which is 720 - 480 = 240.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Shania's dress is longer now. She made it 50% longer. That means she added half of the original length to the dress. If the original length is x, then she added x/2 to it. So the new length is x + x/2.

Then she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So the final length is x + x/2 + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm. So we can write an equation:

x + x/2 + 20 = 140

To make it easier, let's convert x/2 to a decimal. x/2 is the same as 0.5x. So the equation becomes:

x + 0.5x + 20 = 140

Combine x and 0.5x:
1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

"Let's think about this problem. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find out how old one of the twins is.

Imagine the triplet's age is x. Then the twin's age is x + 7. There are 2 twins, so their total age is 2(x + 7). There are 3 triplets, so their total age is 3x.

We know their combined ages are 44, so we can write an equation:

2(x + 7) + 3x = 44

Let's simplify this. We can multiply 2 by (x + 7) to get 2x + 14. Now our equation is:

2x + 14 + 3x = 44

Combine the x's: 5x + 14 = 44

Now subtract 14 from both sides: 5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6

So the triplet is 6 years old. The twin is 7 years older, so the twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

Now, we know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. If 5 lollipops cost $2.00, then 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

If 4 candies cost $1.20, then 1 candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

The heartworm check costs some money, but we don't know how much. We know it's 60% of the total bill. The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check.

Let's say the total bill is $x. Then the heartworm check is 60% of $x, which is 0.6x.

We know the total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check. So, we can write an equation:

He bought 5 croissants for $3 each. That's 5 x $3 = $15.
He bought 4 cinnamon rolls for $2.50 each. That's 4 x $2.50 = $10.
He bought 3 mini quiches for $4 each. That's 3 x $4 = $12.
He bought 13 blueberry muffins for $1 each. That's 13 x $1 = $13.

Now, let's add all these up: $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

Marcus has a special card that gives him 10% off. To find 10% of $50, we can multiply $50 by 0.10. That's $50 x 0.10 = $5.

So, we subtract $5 from $50: $50 - $5 = $45.

"Erin has $6.00. Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. If she buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 scoop free. 

Let's see how many scoops she can buy with $6.00. If she buys 2 scoops, it costs $3.00. She can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops with $6.00 because $6.00 divided by $3.00 is 2. 

So, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free. That's 2 x 2 = 4 scoops she pays for, and 2 scoops free. 

4 scoops + 2 scoops = 6 scoops.

The answer is: 6"
"Ginger and Amy both have 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

There are 7 days in a week. So, two weeks is 7 x 2 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day. In 14 days, she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces. She has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day. In 14 days, she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces. She has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces. To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract 44 from 58. 58 - 44 = 14.

72 / 3 = 24

So, Mr. Boarden wants to cover 24 sq ft. He needs 24 tiles for every sq ft. To find the total tiles needed, we multiply 24 sq ft by 24 tiles.

24 * 24 = 576

"James went to pick blueberries. He had to pay $20 to go, and then $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picked. He picked 30 pounds. If he bought them at the store, they would cost $2.5 per pound.

First, let's see how much James paid to pick the blueberries. He paid $20 to go, and then $1.5 for each pound. So, for 30 pounds, that's $1.5 x 30 = $45. Adding the $20, James paid $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's see how much it would cost to buy 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. They cost $2.5 per pound, so that's $2.5 x 30 = $75.

James paid $65 to pick the blueberries, but it would cost $75 to buy them at the store. So, James saved $75 - $65 = $10.

When Helga's arms are up, she taps each foot 200 times per minute. She does this for 2 minutes. So, she taps each foot 200 * 2 = 400 times. Since she has 2 feet, she taps a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

When Helga's arms are down, her right foot taps 300 times per minute and her left foot taps 250 times per minute. She does this for 3 minutes. So, her right foot taps 300 * 3 = 900 times and her left foot taps 250 * 3 = 750 times. In total, she taps 900 + 750 = 1650 times.

Now, let's add the taps when her arms are up and when her arms are down: 800 + 1650 = 2450.

First, let's see how much the road fixer costs. 3 buckets for $25 each is 3 x $25 = $75. Then we add the $120 the city will take, so $75 + $120 = $195.

Now, let's see how much money Ron will save. If he doesn't fix the pothole, it will cost him $450. But if he fixes it, it will cost him $195. So, he will save $450 - $195 = $255.

The other 2 friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. That's 2 pizzas. 3/4 of 12 slices is 9 slices. So, 2 x 9 = 18 slices eaten.

Now, we add the slices eaten: 24 + 18 = 42 slices eaten.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding the 4 inches, Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe. 
Let's say Bobby's shoe is x inches. Then, 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90.
Then, we divide both sides by 9: x = 10.

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches.

"Krissa needs to order shirts for her preschool students. Let's count how many shirts she needs.

First, 11 students need extra-small shirts. Then, twice as many students need small shirts. That's 2 x 11 = 22 students. 

Next, 4 less than the number of small students need medium shirts. So, 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.

Now, half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts. That's 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Lastly, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts. So, 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

Let's add all the students together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

"Let's break it down. We have three houses and 250 cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs. The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's say the first house needs x cases. Then the second house needs 2x cases, because it's double the first. The third house needs 2x cases too, because it's double the first.

We know that all the houses together need 250 cases. So we can add them up: x + 2x + 2x = 250.

That's like saying 5x = 250. If we divide 250 by 5, we get 50. So x is 50.

The third house needs 2x, and x is 50. So the third house needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases.

Since Jack drives back home too, we need to add another 2 hours for the drive back. So, the total time Jack spends driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Jack also spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time he's gone, we add the driving time and the museum time: 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

First, let's find the movies in series. If 1/3 of the movies are in series, that's like dividing 600 by 3. 600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies. These movies cost 1/6 of the normal price. The normal price is $10, so 1/6 of that is $10 ÷ 6 = $1.67. Now, we multiply 200 movies by $1.67. That's 200 x $1.67 = $334.

Now, let's find the old movies. We have 600 - 200 = 400 movies left. 40% of these are old. 40% is like 40/100, so we multiply 400 by 40/100. That's 400 x 0.4 = 160 old movies. These cost $5 each, so 160 x $5 = $800.

We have 400 - 160 = 240 movies left. These are normal movies and cost $10 each. 240 x $10 = $2400.

For berries, they get 5 points each. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. So if Emma collects y berries, Ava collects y + 3 berries.

For time, they get 30 points for each second left. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma. So if Emma has t seconds left, Ava has t - 4 seconds left.

We know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So we can set up an equation:

2(4 + x) = 3 + (17 - x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

8 + 2x = 20 - x

Adding x to both sides, we get:

8 + 3x = 20

x = 4

So Bob got 4 white fish.

30% is the same as 30/100. So, we can say that the number of goats (x) is 30/100 of the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x). We can write this as an equation: x = 0.3(14 + x).

To solve for x, we can multiply 0.3 by 14: 0.3 * 14 = 4.2. Now we have: x = 4.2 + 0.3x.

Let's subtract 0.3x from both sides: 0.7x = 4.2.

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7: x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Kris wants to play 30 hours of video games. She played for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. That's 14 days. Half an hour is like 0.5 hours. So, she played 0.5 hours * 14 days = 7 hours.

Then, she played 2 hours every day for 1 week. That's 7 days. So, she played 2 hours * 7 days = 14 hours.

She played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours. But she needs 30 hours. So, she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"So we have two cars. One car is going 60 miles per hour and the other car is going 70 miles per hour. The faster car passes the slower car. We want to know how far apart they will be after 2 hours.

Let's think about it. If the slower car goes 60 miles per hour, in 2 hours it will go 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The faster car goes 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will go 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Now, we need to find out how far apart they are. To do that, we subtract the distance the slower car went from the distance the faster car went. So, 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold. 
The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. 
So, $600 + $300 = $900

Then, I need to find 30% of $900. 
To do that, I'll multiply $900 by 0.3. 
$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, I'll add the $270 to the $900. 
$900 + $270 = $1170

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to know how many kids passed the test and how many kids took the test.

340 out of 500 third-graders passed. 
40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. 
The fifth-graders did twice as well as the fourth-graders. So, 2 x 40% is 80%. 
80% of 400 is 320, so 320 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.
And let's add up all the kids who took the test: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

To find the pass rate, we divide the number of kids who passed by the number of kids who took the test: 700 ÷ 1000 = 0.7. 
To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.7 x 100 = 70.

Now, we add the quarts of tea they drank: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. We also have 10 quarts left, so we add that too: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

There are 4 quarts in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide 48 by 4: 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

Let's see how many quarters Jack used. 4 hours is 240 minutes. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. So, 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His 2 friends who are not as good used 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. There are 2 of them, so they used 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

His super good friend used 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add all the quarters: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Each quarter is 25 cents. So, 68 * 25 cents = 1700 cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 1700 / 100 = 17 dollars.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. So Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We can add up all the cards: x (PJ's cards) + 3x (Smendrick's cards) + 3x + 12 (Becca's cards) = 341

Combine the x's: x + 3x + 3x = 7x

So the equation is: 7x + 12 = 341

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 3 x 47 = 141 cards.

"The concert is 2 hours long. We need to change that to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

There's a 10-minute break, so we subtract that: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on, 6 minutes to play, and 2 minutes to get off. That's 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we divide the time we have (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes): 110 ÷ 10 = 11.

"Brenda put $300 into a special account. It earns a lot of interest every year. The interest is 3/4 of the money she put in. To find 3/4 of $300, we multiply $300 by 3 and then divide by 4.

$900 / 4 = $225

So, she earns $225 every year. After 3 years, she will earn $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the interest to the money she put in: $300 + $675 = $975.

We also know 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from 50. 50 - 20 = 30. So, 30 floral shirts have no buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. 30 - 20 = 10.

In the second year, they will build 3 times the number of homes built in the first year. So, 3 x 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built so far. They built 12 + 36 = 48 homes in the first two years. Doubling this is 48 x 2 = 96. But this is how many homes they will have in total after the third year, not how many they will build in the third year. They will build 96 homes in the third year.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

I am three years younger than my brother, so if my brother is B, I am B - 3.

I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister is (B - 3) - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom is 3B - 1.

When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we try B = 19.

If B = 19:
I am B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16
My sister is (B - 3) - 2 = (19 - 3) - 2 = 14
My mom is 3B - 1 = 3(19) - 1 = 56

B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105 (not 87)

If B = 20:
I am B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
My sister is (B - 3) - 2 = (20 - 3) - 2 = 15
My mom is 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 20 + 17 + 15 + 59 = 111 (not 87)

However, if B = 19 is too low and B = 20 is too high, we should try to adjust the ages of the mom and the sister.

If B = 19:
I am B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16
My mom is 3B - 17 = 3(19) - 17 = 40

B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 17) = 19 + 16 + 12 + 40 = 87

So, I am 16 years old.

She got $6 from Joe, $18 from Kamala, and $30 from Alba. That's $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

She made $80 in total. So she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade.

"To make face masks, Jo needs some material. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many groups of 4 masks are in 20. We can do that by dividing 20 by 4, which is 5. Since each group needs 2 yards, we multiply 5 by 2, which is 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many groups of 3 masks are in 8. We can do that by dividing 8 by 3, which is 2 with a little extra. We can multiply 2 by 2.25, which is 4.5, and then add a little more for the extra mask. Since 8 is 2 more than 6, and 6 is 2 groups of 3, we can add 2.25 / 3, which is 0.75, to 4.5. That's 5.25 yards.

Now, we add the yards for the small and large masks. 10 yards for the small masks plus 5.25 yards for the large masks is 15.25 yards.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Peter, Paul, and John's ages add up to 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John. Let's say John is x years old. Then Paul is x + 10 years old.

We also know that Peter's age is equal to Paul and John's age added together. So Peter's age is x + (x + 10).

Now, let's add up their ages: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 100. 

Combine the x's: 3x + 20 = 100.

Now, subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 80.

Divide by 3: x = 26.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll use 26.67 to find the other ages.

John is x years old, so John is 26.67 years old, but we'll use 26.67 to find the other ages.

Paul is x + 10 years old, so Paul is 26.67 + 10 = 36.67 years old.

Peter's age is x + (x + 10), so Peter's age is 26.67 + 36.67 = 63.34 years old, but since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to 63 years old.

However, we can't have a fraction of a year, so we'll use whole numbers. Let's try x = 20, x = 25, and x = 30.

If x = 20, then Paul is 30 and Peter is 50.

If x = 25, then Paul is 35 and Peter is 60.

If x = 30, then Paul is 40 and Peter is 70.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 widgets in a day, so in 30 days, it makes 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 widgets in a day, so in 30 days, it makes 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets.

Each widget sells for $6. So, let's find out how much money we can make from each machine.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 widgets, and each widget sells for $6, so we can make 43200 x 6 = $259200.

900 - 58 = 842

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house. They also charge $35 for each hour they work. If they work a little bit of an hour, they still charge $35. They also charge for the parts they use.

The plumber worked 2.25 hours. That's more than 2 hours, so we have to round up to 3 hours. That's 3 x $35 = $105.

They also used $60 in parts. Now, we add the visit charge, the labor cost, and the parts cost.

$40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

"James bought 10 CDs for $15 each. That's 10 x $15 = $150. But he got 40% off. To find 40% of $150, I'll multiply $150 by 0.4. That's $60. So he got $150 - $60 = $90 off. He paid $150 - $90 = $60.

Then James sold 5 CDs for $40. Now, let's see how much he lost. He paid $60 and got $40. So he lost $60 - $40 = $20.

"Jen has yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots to sell. We need to find out how much money she will get.

Yams are $1.5 each. She has 6 yams. So, 6 x $1.5 = $9.

Sweet potatoes are $2 each. She has 10 sweet potatoes. So, 10 x $2 = $20.

Carrots are $1.25 each. She has 4 carrots. So, 4 x $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the money together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"James is swimming across a 20-mile lake. He swims 2 miles per hour. He swims 60% of the way, then rests, then swims the rest of the way at half speed.

First, we need to find out how far he swims the first time. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles. He swims 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Then, he rests for half of 6 hours, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. But he swims half as fast, so 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

So, we add up all the time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Cayley sells newspapers and gets some money for each one he sells. He gets 10% for the New York Times and 8% for the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's find out how much money he gets from the New York Times. He sells 6 of them for $5 each. So, 6 x $5 is $30. Now, we need to find 10% of $30. To do that, we can move the decimal point one place to the left, so $30 becomes $3.00, and then we multiply by 10, but since we moved the decimal point, we actually multiply by 0.10. So, $30 x 0.10 is $3.

Now, let's find out how much money he gets from the Wall Street Journal. He sells 10 of them for $15 each. So, 10 x $15 is $150. Now, we need to find 8% of $150. We do the same thing, move the decimal point one place to the left, so $150 becomes $15.00, and then we multiply by 8, but since we moved the decimal point, we actually multiply by 0.08. So, $150 x 0.08 is $12.

Now, we add the money he gets from both newspapers. $3 + $12 is $15.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored. So if Azibo scored some points, Bahati scored 20 more than that. 

Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar. So if Dinar scored some points, Bahati scored 10 more than that.

We know that all their points add up to 45. Let's say Azibo scored x points. Then Bahati scored x + 20 points, and Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 points, which is x + 10 points.

Now, we add all their points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points.

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, let's divide the total minutes by 15 minutes (the time it takes to staple 30 reports):
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply 60 by 30:
60 * 30 = 1800

So, the number of empty beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Now, 50 people come to the hospital every day. In 2 weeks, that's 14 days. 
50 * 14 = 700 people come to the hospital in 2 weeks.

The problem says the island had 4 times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, we multiply the holes from the first day by 4: 10 * 4 = 40.

"Let's break this down step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe caught 339 Pokémon together. We also know that Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught x Pokémon. Then Stan caught 4x - 13 Pokémon, and Alex caught 4x - 8 Pokémon.

We can add these up to get the total number of Pokémon they caught:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine the x's:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon. Now we can find out how many Stan caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

Then, the bird flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles. But the bird was flying north, so we need to subtract this distance from the distance it flew south.

Finally, the bird flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To cook 90 shrimp, we need to see how many groups of 30 are in 90. That's 3 groups. So, it will take her 3 x 10 = 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp. 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"The air conditioner cools the room. It cools 2 degrees when it's on low and 3 degrees when it's on high. When it's off, the room gets warmer by 2 degrees.

First, the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. So, it cooled 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours. That's 2 x 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was on high for 4 hours. So, it cooled 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours. That's 3 x 4 = 12 degrees.

So, it cooled 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After that, the air conditioner was off for 2 hours. The room got warmer by 2 degrees each hour. That's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

So, the room is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than when we started.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to think about how old he was when he saw it the second time.

Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. Bill was three times as old as his dad when he saw the comet the second time. So, Bill was 3 x 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

The comet comes back every 75 years. So, when Bill saw the comet the second time, we need to go back 75 years to find out how old he was when he saw it the first time.

He writes 2 checks for the church every month. That's 2 x 12 = 24 checks a year.

He writes 1 check for the pest and lawn service every 3 months. There are 4 of those in a year. So that's 4 checks a year.

"There are 2 planes. One plane goes to Poland, and the other plane goes to 3 places: Greece, France, and Germany. 

The plane that goes to Poland makes 44 trips. The other plane makes twice as many trips as the Poland plane. So, the other plane makes 44 x 2 = 88 trips.

The plane that goes to 3 places goes to Greece 3/4 of the time. To find 3/4 of 88, I multiply 88 by 3 and then divide by 4. 88 x 3 = 264, and 264 / 4 = 66. So, it goes to Greece 66 times.

That means it goes to France and Germany 88 - 66 = 22 times. It splits those 22 trips between France and Germany, so it goes to France 22 / 2 = 11 times.

"We know that there are 4 kids: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Their total age is 20 years. 

Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, their total age is 3 + 4 = 7 years.

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of kids. The total age is 20 and the number of kids is 4. 

Average age = Total age / Number of kids
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so 
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now, we know the ages of Akbar (3 years), Alessandro (4 years), and Helene (10 years). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting their ages from the total age.

Total age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age
20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + Wilfred's age
20 = 17 + Wilfred's age
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start making it 3 hours before that. So, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

First, we add the seats for graduates and teachers: 950 + 300 = 1250. Now, we subtract that from the total seats: 6000 - 1250 = 4750. That's how many seats are left for friends and family.

Now, we need to divide those seats by the number of graduates. There are 950 graduates. So, we divide 4750 by 950. That's like sharing 4750 cookies among 950 kids.

4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Now, we need to find out how many small jelly beans he can eat. We know that 3 small jelly beans are the same as 1 medium jelly bean. So, we need to multiply the number of medium jelly beans by 3.

"Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days. That's 6 x 3 = 18 hours. She gets $15 a day, so that's $15 x 3 = $45. But she has to pay $3 a day for parking, so that's $3 x 3 = $9. She has to pay that, so we subtract it from her money: $45 - $9 = $36. Now we know she has $36. We want to know how much she makes per hour, so we divide $36 by 18 hours. That's $36 ÷ 18 = $2.

So Richard can put 8 bottles in his driveway. But he starts at the first bottle, so he only needs to move to 7 more bottles. 

It takes him 5 seconds to move to each bottle. If he needs to move to 7 bottles, we multiply 7 by 5.

"To find out how much money Amor has left, we need to add up the cost of the cheese she bought and then take that away from the money she had.

The Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound. She bought 2 pounds, so that's 2 x $11 = $22.
The mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound. She bought 3 pounds, so that's 3 x $6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of both cheeses: $22 + $18 = $40.
Amor had $50, so we take away the cost of the cheese: $50 - $40 = $10.

"So Jim went to college for 4 years. He got $50,000 in loans each year. That's $50,000 x 4 = $200,000 in loans.

Before college, Jim made $25,000 a year. He didn't work for 4 years, so he lost $25,000 x 4 = $100,000.

Jim needs to make $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost money) = $300,000.

After college, Jim makes $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 a year. To find out how many years it takes to make $300,000, we divide $300,000 by $75,000.

So, the fabric needs to be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long. And it needs to be 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

To find the area of the fabric, we multiply the length and the width. That's 8 x 10 = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we multiply 80 by 2.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered a little more than one-fifth of Monday's letters. One-fifth of 425 is 425 ÷ 5 = 85. Then they added 17 more, so 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered twice as many as Tuesday, plus 5 more. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 x 102 = 204. Then they added 5, so 204 + 5 = 209.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to add up all the money lost and won, then divide by the number of races.

Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race. 
Then he won $11 on the second race. 
To find out how much he won, we need to do 2 x $5 = $10, then add $1, so $10 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost $16.50. 
To find out how much he lost, we need to do 1.5 x $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's add up all the money: -$5 (lost) + $11 (won) - $16.50 (lost) = -$10.50. 
Since we want to know how much he lost, we don't count the money he won. 
So, we just add the money he lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

But we need to find the average, so we divide by the number of races: $21.50 ÷ 3 = $7.17.

However, we need to consider the money he won as well. 
So, the total amount is -$10.50 and there were 3 races. 
-$10.50 ÷ 3 = -$3.50.

Since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we just remove the negative sign. 
So, the average amount lost is $3.50.

"Let's say the first person got some money, and we'll call that x.

The second person got $80 more than the first person, so they got x + 80.

The third person got twice what the second person got, so they got 2(x + 80).

We know they all got a total of $1920, so we can add up what they all got:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

That's like saying x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

If we add the x's together, we get 4x + 240 = 1920.

If we take away 240 from both sides, we get 4x = 1680.

If we divide both sides by 4, we get x = 420.

So the first person got $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to do some math.

First, we need to know how many hours they worked in a day. They worked 3/8 of a day. There are 24 hours in a day. So, we multiply 24 by 3 and then divide by 8.

24 * 3 = 72
72 / 8 = 9

So, they worked 9 hours a day. They worked for 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply 3 by 7.

3 * 7 = 21

They worked for 21 days. Now, we multiply 9 hours by 21 days.

9 * 21 = 189

Now, we know they worked 189 hours in total. There are 4 painters. So, we divide 189 by 4.

189 / 4 = 47.25

"Let's say the number of balls Rory got in the second set is x. 

He got 4 more balls in the first set, so that's x + 4.

In the third set, he got half the balls he got in the second set, so that's x/2.

We know he got 19 balls in total, so we can write this:

x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

That's the same as:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine the x's:
5x + 8 = 38

Now subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

So Rory got 6 balls in the second set. Now we can find out how many he got in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Rory got 10 tennis balls in the first set.

$20000 * 0.21 = $4200

So, the car goes down by $4200 in the first year. 
$20000 - $4200 = $15800

In the second year, the car goes down by 21% of $15800. 
$15800 * 0.21 = $3328

So, the car goes down by $3328 in the second year. 
$15800 - $3328 = $12472

In the third year, the car goes down by 21% of $12472. 
$12472 * 0.21 = $2621.52

The second train comes 30 minutes after the first train leaves. So, it comes in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for 1/4 of the time the first train stayed. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so 1/4 of that is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train leaves in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train comes 60 minutes after the second train leaves. So, it comes in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves right away, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it comes in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"Melanie wants to make a toothpick sculpture. She needs 200 toothpicks. She gets 10 toothpicks every week from her mom's sandwiches. She has been saving them for 12 weeks. 

Let's see how many toothpicks she has so far. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs 200 toothpicks, but she only has 120. So, she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

If she gets 10 toothpicks every week, how many weeks will it take her to get 80 toothpicks? 
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"Mr. Rogers bought a watch for 75% of its original price. That means he paid 3/4 of the price. The original price was $2000, so he paid 3/4 of $2000, which is $1500.

Then, he sold the watch to his friend for 120% of what he paid. That means his friend paid 6/5 of $1500, which is $1800.

Now, let's see how much his friend saved. The original price was $2000, and his friend paid $1800. So, his friend saved $200.

To find the percentage, we need to divide the amount saved ($200) by the original price ($2000) and multiply by 100.

($200 ÷ $2000) * 100 = 10%

Final Answer: 10"
"Imagine we have 5 springs, and each spring makes 1 jellyfish every second. We need to find out how many jellyfish they make in 4 hours.

First, let's find out how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, and 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour. For 4 hours, we multiply 3600 by 4, which is 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, each spring makes 1 jellyfish every second, so in 14400 seconds, 1 spring will make 14400 jellyfish. But we have 5 springs, so we multiply 14400 by 5, which is 14400 * 5 = 72000.

"So, Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's say Sam gets some feet of fence, and we'll call that number x. Then Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know they have 100 feet together, so we can add Sam's and Harry's parts: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Now, let's add the x's: 2x + 60 = 100.

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Marcel's bike store sells three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The prices are: MTB is $500, BMX is $250 (half of MTB), and Trekking is $450. Marcel sold 300 bikes in a month.

Half of the bikes were Trekking, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes. 15% of the bikes were BMX, so that's 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes. The rest were MTB bikes, so that's 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the money Marcel made:
- 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500
- 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250
- 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500

Adding all the money together: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay every hour. It also works for 6 hours, so it picks up 3 x 6 = 18 bales of hay.

Now, we need to find out how many bales of hay are left in the field. To do this, we subtract the number of bales the truck picked up from the number of bales the farmer made. That's 30 - 18 = 12.

"John goes to school 5 days a week. He has 8 classes a day. Each class is 40 minutes long. So, he spends 8 x 40 = 320 minutes in school each day. 

Since he goes to school 5 days a week, he spends 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in school each week.

He also studies on Saturday and Sunday. He studies 1/16 of the time he studies in school. 1/16 of 1600 is 100 minutes. He studies 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday. So, he studies 100 + 100 = 200 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in school and the minutes he studies on Saturday and Sunday: 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, we divide 1800 by 60 to get the hours: 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find the height of the third-floor balcony. Since each story is 24 feet high, we multiply 3 stories by 24 feet: 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

When Nathan drops the ball, it bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. So, on the first bounce, the ball goes 2/3 of 72 feet. To find 2/3 of 72, we multiply 72 by 2 and then divide by 3: (72 x 2) / 3 = 144 / 3 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball goes 2/3 of its height on the first bounce. So, we multiply 48 by 2 and then divide by 3: (48 x 2) / 3 = 96 / 3 = 32 feet.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 from 74. That's 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 to 69. That's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."

"Imagine you have a big pizza that's cut in half. The T-Rex ate one half of the triceratops, so the other half is left. Then the velociraptors ate half of that half. The Allosaurus ate the last half of that half, which is 270 kilograms.

To find out how much the whole triceratops weighed, we need to work backwards. If the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, that's half of what was left. So the velociraptors ate the same amount, 270 kilograms.

Now we add the two halves together: 270 + 270 = 540 kilograms. This is the half that was left after the T-Rex ate.

Since the T-Rex ate the other half, we need to double 540 to find the whole weight. 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Now, let's find the area of the small walls. 5 x 8 is 40. We have two of those, so 40 + 40 is 80.

We add the areas of the big and small walls. 160 + 80 is 240.

We know that one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons we need, we divide 240 by 20. 240 ÷ 20 is 12.

One gallon of paint costs $12. We need 12 gallons, so 12 x $12 is $144.

Now, let's see how far the second train goes in 3 hours. We multiply 30 miles per hour by 3 hours:

Now, we know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles.

$20.00 * 20/100 = $4.00

So the frying pan was $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Sheila also bought some towels. They were $30.00, but they were on sale too. We need to find 10% of $30.00. 10% is the same as 10/100. To find 10% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 10/100.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave those 16 stickers to Kris. But before that, Luis used half of the stickers. So, Luis had 16 x 2 = 32 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Seth had 32 x 2 = 64 stickers.

"John bought 3 big bags of M&M's. Each big bag weighs 10 ounces. So, we need to add 10 + 10 + 10 to find the total weight. That's 30 ounces.

We know that 1 ounce has 30 M&M's. So, we multiply 30 ounces by 30 M&M's. That's 30 x 30 = 900 M&M's.

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we need to divide 900 by 10. That's 900 ÷ 10 = 90.

First, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5.

120 * 5 = 600

Now we know the 2nd fastest car can go 600 miles per hour. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply 600 by 1.25.

"Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted some eggs, and Camden painted 12 more. If we add them together, we get 30. 

So, if Sarah painted 9 eggs, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together. Since they painted the same number, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract 13 from 21: 21 - 13 = 8.

"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them in boxes. Each box can hold 8 crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce and each box weighs 8 ounces. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's find out how many boxes Nik needs. We can do this by dividing the number of crayons by the number of crayons each box can hold. 
200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Now, let's find the weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so we multiply the number of crayons by 1 ounce.
200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Next, let's find the weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so we multiply the number of boxes by 8 ounces.
25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together.
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. To find the total weight in pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16.
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

"Grandma walks 3 miles every day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she walks 40 minutes on the beach. 

Let's think about it. If she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, how many miles does she walk in 1 minute? We can divide 2 miles by 40 minutes to find out. 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we know she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk. So, she walks 2 * 1/20 miles per minute = 1/10 miles per minute on the sidewalk.

She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. If she walks 1/10 miles per minute, how many minutes does it take her to walk 1 mile? We can divide 1 mile by 1/10 miles per minute to find out. 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.

So, she walks 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk. To find the total time, we add 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Imagine you have two kinds of water, one is 33 degrees and the other is unknown. When you mix 4 parts of the 33-degree water with 1 part of the unknown water, it gets warm enough to drink, which is at least 40 degrees.

Let's think about it like this: the 4 parts of 33-degree water make the mixture cooler, and the 1 part of unknown water makes it warmer. To make the mixture at least 40 degrees, the unknown water must be very warm.

If we do some simple math, we can figure it out. The 4 parts of 33-degree water make the mixture 132 degrees in total (4 x 33 = 132). To make the mixture at least 40 degrees, the total must be at least 200 degrees (5 x 40 = 200). So, the unknown water must add at least 68 degrees to the mixture (200 - 132 = 68).

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know the red rope is 4 times as long as the blue rope. We also know the blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope. Let's say the blue rope is B, the yellow rope is Y, and the red rope is R.

So, R = 4B (because the red rope is 4 times as long as the blue rope)
And B = Y - 7 (because the blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope)

We also know that the total length of all 3 ropes is 37 cm. So, R + B + Y = 37.

Now, let's put it all together. We can replace R with 4B and B with Y - 7 in the equation R + B + Y = 37.

So, 4B + B + Y = 37 becomes 4B + (Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Now, let's think about B. If B = Y - 7, then we can replace B with Y - 7 in the equation 4B + (Y - 7) + Y = 37.

So, 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Now, let's solve for Y. We can start by adding 7 to both sides of the equation 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37.

4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 + 28 + 7
4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 72
6Y - 35 = 72

Now, let's add 35 to both sides of the equation 6Y - 35 = 72.

6Y = 72 + 35
6Y = 107

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation 6Y = 107 by 6.

Y = 107 / 6
Y = 17.83 (but we can't have a fraction of a centimeter, so we'll round down to 17.83 ≈ 18, but we'll use 17.83 for now)

Now, let's find B. We know B = Y - 7.

B = 17.83 - 7
B = 10.83

Now, let's find R. We know R = 4B.

R = 4 * 10.83
R = 43.32 (but we can't have a fraction of a centimeter, so we'll round down to 43.32 ≈ 43, but we'll use 43.32 for now)

However, we know that R + B + Y = 37. So, let's try again.

R + B + Y = 37
43.32 + 10.83 + 17.83 - 34.98 = 37
37 = 37

However, we know that R + B + Y = 37. So, let's try again.

R + B + Y = 37
R + (Y - 7) + Y = 37
R + 2Y - 7 = 37
R + 2Y = 44

Now, let's think about R. We know R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

R = 4(Y - 7)
R = 4Y - 28

Now, let's put it all together. We can replace R with 4Y - 28 in the equation R + 2Y = 44.

So, 4Y - 28 + 2Y = 44.

Now, let's solve for Y. We can start by adding 28 to both sides of the equation 4Y - 28 + 2Y = 44.

6Y = 44 + 28
6Y = 72

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation 6Y = 72 by 6.

Y = 72 / 6
Y = 12

Now, let's find B. We know B = Y - 7.

B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now, let's find R. We know R = 4B.

R = 4 * 5
R = 20

"Ronnie got $5. Rissa got 3 times more than Ronnie. So Rissa got $5 x 3 = $15.

They both gave some money to their little sister. Let's call that money x. So Ronnie has $5 - x left and Rissa has $15 - x left.

Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. That means she has 4/5 of $15 left. 4/5 of $15 is $12. So Rissa has $12 left.

We know Rissa has $15 - x left. We also know Rissa has $12 left. So $15 - x = $12.

If $15 - x = $12, then x must be $3. That's because $15 - $3 = $12.

So Ronnie gave $3 to his little sister. Ronnie had $5. Now he has $5 - $3 = $2.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to add up the areas of all the rooms.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. It's 20 feet by 12 feet, so we multiply 20 and 12. That's 240 square feet. There are 4 bedrooms, so we multiply 240 by 4. That's 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, we multiply 240 by 5. That's 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

"Imagine you have a big box of 100 dishwasher pods that costs $12. Now, there's a special box that has 20% more pods, but it still costs $12. We need to find out how many dishwasher cycles we can run with the new box for $1.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the special box. 20% more pods means we add 20% of 100 to 100. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. That's 20. So, the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how much one pod costs. We divide $12 by 120 pods. That's $0.1 per pod.

If we want to know how many cycles we can run for $1, we divide $1 by $0.1. That's 10 cycles.

"Thomas took 1000 dollars from the bank in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he got, we need to divide 1000 by 20. That's 1000 ÷ 20 = 50.

Then, he lost 10 bills. So, we subtract 10 from 50. That's 50 - 10 = 40.

After that, he used half of the bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20. So, he used 20 bills and had 20 bills left.

Now, we need to find out how much money he had left. Since each bill is 20 dollars, we multiply 20 by 20. That's 20 x 20 = 400 dollars.

Then, Thomas got three times more money. So, we multiply 400 by 3. That's 400 x 3 = 1200 dollars.

Finally, he changed all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he got, we need to divide 1200 by 5. That's 1200 ÷ 5 = 240.

"Let's break down the soccer match.

In the first half, team A scored 4 goals. Team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. That's 4 x 2 = 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of team B's goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals.
- Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"The teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk. He used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much he used, we need to find 45% of 5. 
45% is the same as 45/100. So, we multiply 5 by 45/100. 
5 * 45/100 = 2.25 inches.

Now, we subtract 2.25 from 5 to find out how much chalk is left. 
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how much that is, we multiply 5 by 20/100. 
5 * 20/100 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

But the teacher can't use the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches. So, we need to find out how many days it will take to reach 2 inches. 
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left to reach 2 inches.
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

The teacher can use the chalk for 2 days and still have 2 inches left. On the third day, the teacher will use 1 inch and have 1 inch left, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 days before it is too small.

"There are 12 boys and 12 girls in Miss Albert's class. Some of them are on varsity. 

To find out how many girls are on varsity, we need to divide the number of girls by 3. 12 ÷ 3 = 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

To find out how many boys are on varsity, we need to divide the number of boys by 4. 12 ÷ 4 = 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity. 4 + 3 = 7. So, 7 students are on varsity.

There are 12 boys and 12 girls in total. 12 + 12 = 24. So, there are 24 students in the class.

To find out how many students are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. 24 - 7 = 17.

"Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk. But some of it was bad. We need to find out how much money he got back.

First, we need to know how much the milk cost. It was $3.5 per gallon. So we multiply 4000 by $3.5.
4000 x $3.5 = $14,000

Now, we know 2/5 of the milk was bad. To find out how many gallons that is, we need to do a little math. 
2/5 is the same as 2 ÷ 5. So we divide 4000 by 5 and then multiply by 2.
4000 ÷ 5 = 800
800 x 2 = 1600

So 1600 gallons of milk were bad. Now we multiply 1600 by $3.5 to find out how much money Mr. Marcellus got back.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If Colin is C years old now, then seven years from now, he will be C + 7 years old. Wendy is five times that, so Wendy is 5(C + 7) years old.

In 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. He will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, C + 25 = (1/3) * Wendy's age now.

We know Wendy's age now is 5(C + 7). So, we can write:
C + 25 = (1/3) * 5(C + 7)

Now, let's simplify this. To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)

This means 3C + 75 = 5C + 35.

Now, let's get all the C's on one side. We can subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Now, let's get all the numbers on one side. We can subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Now, let's find C. We can divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

Now, we know he can buy 54 groups of 100 books. 
54 groups * 100 books = 5400 books

If Jay makes 1 snowball every 3 minutes and 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes. In 15 minutes, Jay makes 15 / 3 = 5 snowballs.

So, in 15 minutes, Jay makes 5 snowballs, but 2 melt. That means he has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.

Jay wants 60 snowballs. If he gets 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 3s fit into 60. 60 / 3 = 20. That means Jay needs 20 groups of 15 minutes to get 60 snowballs.

So, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they got 1 big pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Since they had 3 bandages left from the first two days, and 12 bandages were left at the end of the first day, they must have had 12 - 3 = 9 bandages left at the end of the second day.

Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and had 9 bandages left, they must have had 28 + 9 = 37 bandages at the start of the second day.

Since they had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day and used 38 bandages, they must have had 12 + 38 = 50 bandages at the end of the first day's order. Since they ordered 50 bandages, they must have had 50 - 50 = 0 bandages before the order, but that can't be right because they had 37 bandages at the start of the second day.

792 / 8 = 99

So, she sells the magazines for $99. To find her profit, we subtract the price she bought the magazines for from the price she sold them for.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"So, Brian has a dehumidifier that removes water from the air. It has three speeds: low, medium, and high. 

The low speed removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian used it for 3 days, so that's 1 x 3 = 3 liters.

The medium speed removes twice as much as the low speed, so that's 2 liters per day. He used it for 3 days, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 liters.

The high speed removes twice as much as the medium speed, so that's 4 liters per day. He used it for 5 days, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add all the liters together: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

120 ÷ 8 = 15

So John's classes can have 15 students each. John has 2 classes, so I multiply 15 by 2.

"Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister. He has to pay back the $300 and 2% more. 2% of $300 is 2/100 * 300 = $6. So he has to pay $300 + $6 = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. That's 11 * $25 = $275. 

Now, we subtract $275 from $306 to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find the total number of jelly beans in the jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. We multiply the base (6 x 6) by the height (15) to get the volume of the jar. That's 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans don't fill the whole jar, we multiply 540 by 0.8 (because they get about 80% efficiency in packing). That's 540 x 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit in 432 cubic inches. Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, we divide 432 by 0.15. That's 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

We know that 30% of the jelly beans are red. To find 30% of 2880, we multiply 2880 by 0.3. That's 2880 x 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his guess from the true number. That's 900 - 864 = 36.

After that, the number of people doubled. That means we multiply by 2. 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people. To find out how many more people can get on, we subtract 180 from 200. 200 - 180 = 20.

We know the board is 40 feet long, so we can add the two pieces together: x + 4x = 40

That's like saying 5x = 40. To find x, we need to divide 40 by 5. 40 ÷ 5 = 8. So x is 8.

Now we know the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times longer, so it's 4 x 8 = 32 feet long.

Carly makes cupcakes and brownies. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say she made 'c' cupcakes. Then, she made 3 times 'c' brownies, which is 3c. But she made 2 less, so it's 3c - 2.

We know the total number of treats is 10. So, we can make an equation: c (cupcakes) + 3c - 2 (brownies) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation. First, we combine the 'c's: c + 3c is 4c. So, the equation is 4c - 2 = 10.

Next, we add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Then, we divide by 4: c = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So, 10 * $3 = $30.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to do some math.

First, the price went up in December. To find the new price, we need to add 80% of $40 to $40. 80% is like 80 out of 100, so we can find 80% of $40 by multiplying $40 by 0.8. That's $40 x 0.8 = $32. Now, we add $32 to $40 to get $72.

Then, the price went down in January. To find the new price, we need to subtract 50% of $72 from $72. 50% is like 50 out of 100, so we can find 50% of $72 by multiplying $72 by 0.5. That's $72 x 0.5 = $36. Now, we subtract $36 from $72 to get $36.

Let's add up how much she spends in a week:
- 5 blouses * $5 = $25
- 2 pants * $8 = $16
- 1 skirt * $6 = $6
Total for a week = $25 + $16 + $6 = $47

Now we know John can talk 375 words per minute. He wants to talk for 10 pages. Each page has 450 words. 
So, we multiply 10 pages by 450 words per page. 
10 * 450 = 4500 words

Now we know John has to talk 4500 words. We also know he can talk 375 words per minute. 
To find out how many minutes it will take, we divide 4500 by 375.

So, for the first three days, Conor saw 50 + 70 + 140 people. Let's add that up: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw 60 people each day. That's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

To find out how far he is from his house, we need to see how far he went west and how far he went east.

Distance = Speed * Time

He drove west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, he went 18 * 5 = 90 miles west.

Then he drove east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, he went 18 * 8 = 144 miles east.

"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to do some math.

First, the boat cost $9000. It went down in value by 30% in the first year. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3. That's $2700. So, the boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

Next year, it went down by 30% again. We multiply $6300 by 0.3, which is $1890. So, the boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

The last year, it went down by 20%. We multiply $4410 by 0.2, which is $882. So, the boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Let's add up what Igor got: 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24. He had 29 things in total, so the beakers he got must be 29 - 24 = 5. But he was supposed to get 7 beakers. So, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"James is making 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs. Each leg needs 2 screws. So, each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws. 
Since James is making 4 tables, he needs 4 x 8 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left, we subtract the screws he needs from the screws he has:
40 - 32 = 8

"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs. So, we need to multiply 10 by 2 to find out how many eggs are in the second basket.

10 x 2 = 20

Now, we add the eggs in both baskets together.

10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add the money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the money: 
$430 + $750 = $1180
$1180 + $700 = $1880
$1880 + $300 = $2180

"So, Aaron and Vanessa are running together. Vanessa ran 4 miles. Aaron ran half of that, which is 2 miles. 

Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. If he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, that means Vanessa would take twice as long to run 2 miles. So, it would take Vanessa 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we need to find out how long it would take her to run 4 miles. If it takes her 32 minutes to run 2 miles, it would take her 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

The final answer is: 64"
"The caretaker needs 3 times the length of the dock in line. The dock is 200 feet long. 

So, 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line is needed. 

He already has 6 feet of line. So, we subtract 6 from 600. 

600 - 6 = 594 feet

"Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Each reservation orders 2 meals for $5 each, that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also get a $5 bottle of wine. So each reservation spends $10 + $5 = $15.

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations, so they make 6 x $15 = $90 a night. They are open 2 days a week, so they make 2 x $90 = $180 a week.

"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find out how much he paid for each watermelon, we need to divide $80 by 50.

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 per watermelon

He sold them at a 25% profit. That means he added 25% of $1.60 to the price. To find 25% of $1.60, we multiply $1.60 by 0.25.

$1.60 × 0.25 = $0.40

Now, we add the profit to the cost price.

$1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

"Let's break it down step by step.

Dora will be 12 in 3 years. So, how old is she now? We need to subtract 3 from 12. That's 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora. So, we multiply Dora's age by 2. That's 9 x 2 = 18 years old.

John was 19 when James was born. Now James is 18, so John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, we subtract 32 from 37 to find the age difference. That's 37 - 32 = 5 years.

That means John's youngest son is 5 years old now. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. We need to find out how many oranges they can peel in 60 minutes.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she peels 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Ana peels 20 oranges and Jane peels 15 oranges. To find out how many more oranges Ana peels, we subtract 15 from 20. 
20 - 15 = 5

"Mark got a new radiator for his car. It was on sale for 80% off. That means he paid 20% of the price. The price was $400. To find 20% of $400, I multiply $400 by 0.20. 
$400 * 0.20 = $80

Then Mark paid a mechanic to put the radiator in his car. The mechanic worked for 3 hours and charged $50 per hour. To find the total cost, I multiply $50 by 3.
$50 * 3 = $150

Now I add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's work. 
$80 + $150 = $230

"Let's solve this problem. We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70.

Imagine you have 20 boxes, and each box has either 2 or 4 legs in it. If you add up all the legs, you get 70. 

Let's try to find out how many boxes have 2 legs (chickens) and how many have 4 legs (cows). 

If all the boxes had 2 legs, we would have 20 x 2 = 40 legs. But we have 70 legs, so some boxes must have 4 legs.

Let's see how many more legs we have: 70 - 40 = 30. Since each box with 4 legs has 2 extra legs, we need to divide 30 by 2 to find out how many boxes have 4 legs: 30 / 2 = 15.

So, 15 boxes have 4 legs (cows). Now, we need to find out how many boxes have 2 legs (chickens). We know that we have 20 boxes in total, and 15 have 4 legs. So, the number of boxes with 2 legs is: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"We have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we multiply 7 and 8. 

7 x 8 = 56

There are 4 of us, including Henry. To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by 4.

56 ÷ 4 = 14

Answer: 14"
