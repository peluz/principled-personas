"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to figure out how many eggs she sells. 

First, we need to subtract the eggs she eats and the eggs she uses for baking from the total number of eggs her ducks lay. 

Her ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking. So, the total eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we subtract the eggs she uses from the total number of eggs: 16 - 7 = 9.

Since she sells each egg for $2, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * $2 = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to figure out how much white fiber is needed. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and we need 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can divide 2 by 2 to get the amount of white fiber. 

2 รท 2 = 1

So, we need 1 bolt of white fiber. Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 2.5 times the original value of the house. To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5. 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

First, we find the number of sprints James runs per week. He runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. So, we multiply 3 sprints by 3 times a week: 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Next, we multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint. James runs 60 meters each sprint. So, we multiply 9 sprints by 60 meters: 9 x 60 = 540 meters.

James runs a total of 540 meters per week.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to figure out the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, we multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken needs. This is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. To find the total amount of feed given so far, we add these two amounts together: 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the odd-numbered glasses and the even-numbered glasses separately.

The odd-numbered glasses cost $5 each. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, there are 8 odd-numbered glasses (1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., 15th). The cost of these glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.

The even-numbered glasses cost 60% of $5, which is $3. There are also 8 even-numbered glasses (2nd, 4th, 6th, ..., 16th). The cost of these glasses is 8 * $3 = $24.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the odd-numbered glasses and the even-numbered glasses: $40 + $24 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to figure out how many sheep each city has. 

We know Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we multiply 20 by 4 to get 80 sheep in Charleston. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so we multiply 80 by 2 to get 160 sheep in Toulouse.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. To find 40% of 200 GB, we multiply 200 by 0.4. This is 200 * 0.4 = 80 GB. Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start the download again from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to figure out how far he traveled before turning around and how far he traveled after turning around.

First, let's find the distance he traveled before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, let's find the distance he traveled after turning around. He spent 2 hours in traffic, so he didn't move. Then, he drove for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

After that, he drove for 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5) at 80 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find out how much Eliza made this week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She gets $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works. So, her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay. She worked 45 hours, so she worked 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings. $400 + $60 = $460.

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to get 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180. We can do this by multiplying 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen for each type of pastry.

For the donuts, Toula bought 3 dozen at $68 per dozen, so the cost is 3 x $68 = $204.
For the mini cupcakes, she bought 2 dozen at $80 per dozen, so the cost is 2 x $80 = $160.
For the mini cheesecakes, she bought 6 dozen at $55 per dozen, so the cost is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) at the end of year 6, we need to calculate for year 7.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie starts with some vacuum cleaners, and we don't know how many. Let's call that number 'x'.

She sells 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. To find out how many she sold, we can divide x by 3.

Then, she sells 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners she has left is x - (x/3) - 2. We can simplify this to 2x/3 - 2.

After that, she sells half of what's left at the orange house. To find out how many she has left, we can divide 2x/3 - 2 by 2. This gives us x/3 - 1.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up an equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides:

x/3 = 6

Then, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. To find 20% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.2. 
20 * 0.2 = 4

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. Now, we subtract 4 from the total number of students to find the remaining students.
20 - 4 = 16

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. To find 25% of 16, we multiply 16 by 0.25.
16 * 0.25 = 4

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. Now, we subtract 4 from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
16 - 4 = 12

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

For the electronic gadgets, they're worth $8,000 and will go up 1.2%. To find 1.2% of $8,000, we multiply $8,000 by 0.012. This is $96.

Since $125 is more than $96, the merchant should buy the jewelry to make the most profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distance they traveled on the first day to the distance they traveled on the second day.

On the first day, they traveled 80 miles west. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles north. Since they're traveling in different directions, we can't just add the distances as if they were traveling in a straight line. But since the question is asking for the total distance covered, we can just add the two distances.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she makes from teaching and coaching.

Jill teaches 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly pay from teaching is:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly pay from teaching is:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Jill also coaches 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly pay from coaching is:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly pay from coaching is:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

To find her total yearly salary, we add her pay from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, she will eat 28 x 3 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 by 12 to get the number of dozens.

84 รท 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to figure out how much time she has left and how far she still has to go.

Marissa wants to finish the 12-mile trail in 3 hours because she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. We can find the total time by dividing the total distance by the average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it's 2/3 water, we multiply 2/3 by the amount of orange drink we have left after spilling 1 liter. We had 10 liters, but we spilled 1, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters left. To find 2/3 of 9, we can multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (9 * 2) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 liters of water in the orange drink.

Next, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. It's 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. To find 3/5 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 3 and then divide by 5. This gives us (15 * 3) / 5 = 45 / 5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to figure out how old Raymond is now and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age like this:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age when son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought. 

Marie bought a chicken meal for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. We can find the total cost of the milk by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 5 * $3 = $15. We can find the total cost of the apples by multiplying the number of apples by the cost per apple: 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, we add up the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract the cost of the other items from the total to find the cost of the pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

3 x $16.50 = $49.50

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants. Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants and each pair costs $22.50. 
3 x $22.50 = $67.50

Then, we calculate the cost of the shoes. Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes and each pair costs $42. 
3 x $42 = $126

"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to first figure out how old he is now. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x.

We also know that their total age now is 162. We can write this as an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine the x terms:

18x = 162

Now, divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10

Let's say the number of silver coins is 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. Since the total number of coins is 110, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine the x's and the 30:
2x + 30 = 110

Now, subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, there are 40 silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to 40:

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold his lego sets for $15 each, and he had 13 of them. So, he made 13 x $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left is $160 + $5 = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

The time he runs is 3 hours the first day, and half of that (1.5 hours) the other two days. So, we add up the time: 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

Now, we use the formula for speed: Speed = Distance / Time. Plugging in the numbers, we get Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours.

To find the speed, we do the division: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

"To find the distance Dana can travel, we need to figure out how fast she can run and walk. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she can run. So, if we multiply 3 by 2, we get her running speed: 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana runs 4 times faster than she walks, we can divide her running speed by 4 to get her walking speed: 6 รท 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends 1/3 of her time running and 2/3 of her time walking. In 6 hours, that's 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Now, let's find the distance she can travel in each time period. Distance = speed * time. For running, that's 6 * 2 = 12 miles. For walking, that's 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the running and walking distances: 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

First, we need to find 25% of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 
$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original bill:
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the delivery fee:
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the tip:

"To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can calculate this by multiplying 25 (total oranges) by 0.2 (20% as a decimal).

Number of unripe oranges = 25 * 0.2 = 5

Now, let's add the number of bad and sour oranges to the number of unripe oranges.

Total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges = 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8

Finally, we subtract the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges
= 25 - 8

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of construction. Then, we need to calculate the insurance cost.

The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of construction is $800. So, the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.

The insurance cost is 10% of $1300. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.1. This gives us $130.

Now, we add the total cost before insurance and the insurance cost. $1300 + $130 = $1430.

"To find Marcy's annual pension, we need to figure out how much of the full pension she gets. 

Marcy gets 5% more of the pension each year after 20 years. She worked 10 more years after that (30 - 20 = 10). 

5% per year for 10 years is 10 * 5% = 50%. 

So, she gets 50% of the full pension. The full pension is $50,000. 

50% of $50,000 is 0.5 * $50,000 = $25,000.

The answer is: $25,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate how much she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, she paid $140 per month for 6 months. 
So, the total amount for the first half of the year is 140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she got a 10% discount. 
To find 10% of $140, we multiply 140 by 0.1, which is 14. 
So, she paid 140 - 14 = $126 per month for the second half of the year. 
The total amount for the second half of the year is 126 * 6 = $756.

Now, we add the amounts for the first and second half of the year to find the total amount she paid. 
Total amount = 840 + 756 = $1596.

"To figure out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles her car can go per gallon of gas. We know she drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas. 

We can find the miles per gallon by dividing the miles she drove by the gallons she used. 

Miles per gallon = Total miles / Total gallons used
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Miles per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know her tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles she can drive, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank.

Total miles = Miles per gallon * Total gallons in the tank
Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons

"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one day. He watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, we multiply the hours spent in one day by 3. This gives us 3 hours * 3 days = 9 hours per week.

Now, we need to find the total hours spent in 4 weeks. We multiply the hours spent in one week by 4. This gives us 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of rubies and emeralds first.

The number of diamonds is 175. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we subtract 35 from 175 to find the number of rubies.

Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we multiply the number of rubies by 2.

Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems.

Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and the interest. 

First, we find the total cost of the cell phones. Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each. So, the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.

Next, we calculate the interest. The interest is 2% of $750. To find 2% of $750, we multiply $750 by 0.02. So, the interest is $750 x 0.02 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost and the interest to find the total amount Shiela will pay. The total amount is $750 + $15 = $765.

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, the second level will have twice the square footage of the top level, which is 2 * 16 = 32.

The third level will have twice the square footage of the second level, which is 2 * 32 = 64.

The fourth level will have twice the square footage of the third level, which is 2 * 64 = 128.

So, the square footage of each level is 16, 32, 64, and 128. 

To find the total square footage, we add these numbers: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, so the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day is:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

The total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:

So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

This increase happens every year for the next three years. 
Year 1: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate how many times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
To find 1/4 of 20, we can divide 20 by 4, which is 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day, we need to add up all the pages from his textbooks. 

He has to read 4 pages from Science, 20 pages from Social Studies, 7 pages from History, and 8 pages from Geography. So, the total number of pages is 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

Since Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total. 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has left to finish reading, which is 4 days. 

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to think about his daily routine. John drinks 4 glasses of water each day on weekdays (Monday to Friday). That's 4 glasses * 5 days = 20 glasses of water.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 3 glasses of water each day because he has a soda with dinner instead of water. That's 3 glasses * 2 days = 6 glasses of water.

Now, we add the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 6 = 26.

"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to figure out how many groups of 3 miles are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles.

42 miles รท 3 miles = 14

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we multiply the number of groups (14) by the time it takes to cover each group (10 minutes).

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

"To find the number of pieces left, we need to figure out how many pieces Poppy and her mom placed, then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Poppy placed. Since she placed a quarter of the pieces, we can divide 1000 by 4. 

1000 รท 4 = 250

So, Poppy placed 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed her pieces.

1000 - 250 = 750

Now, her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces her mom placed, we can divide 750 by 3.

750 รท 3 = 250

Her mom placed 250 pieces. Now, we need to find the total number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom.

250 + 250 = 500

Finally, we subtract the total number of pieces placed from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces left.

1000 - 500 = 500

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box.

The box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 1 inch from each side for the length and width, and 1 inch from the top and bottom for the height.

Length (L) = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches

Now, we multiply the length, width, and height to find the inner volume of one box. The formula for volume is V = L * W * H.

V = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3.

Total inner volume = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to figure out how many hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes are in 90 minutes. We can do this by dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode. 

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that after Henry dropped 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. So, before he dropped the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We also know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, if he meant to bake x cookies, he actually baked x + 15 cookies. But we know that he actually baked 115 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 115

Subtract 15 from both sides:
x = 100

But we know that Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, if he baked x cookies this year, he baked x/2 cookies last year. Since x = 100, we can find the number of cookies he baked last year:

x/2 = 100/2
x/2 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to do a few simple math steps.

First, we need to find out how much the gas costs before the cashback. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons:

$3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Next, we need to find out how much cashback the person will get. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, we multiply the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons:

$0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas to find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

"To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice, then divide by 2.

First, let's find out how many roll-ups Beatrice ate. Since her roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long, we multiply 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Next, let's find out how many roll-ups Marcell ate. His roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so we multiply 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of roll-ups they both ate: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 90 รท 2 = 45.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to figure out how far Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, we can find out how many feet she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds.

20 feet รท 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the distance.

1.25 feet/second ร 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now we know Julia rowed 80 feet to reach the shore. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. So, we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

80 feet รท 10 feet = 8 intervals

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total amount of water.

8 intervals ร 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, so we divide that by 6:
1800 รท 6 = 300

This means Brittany's phone can hold 300 pictures. Now, we know that the number of pictures Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. To find the number of ducks, we divide the number of pictures Brittany's phone can hold by 50:

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate how much she spent on the lumber and how much she sells it for.

She bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 for $10 each, so she spent 10 x $10 = $100 on those. She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 for $16 each, so she spent 5 x $16 = $80 on those. In total, she spent $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices went up by 50%, she can sell them for 150% of what she paid. To find 150% of a number, we multiply it by 1.5. So, she can sell the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for 10 x $10 x 1.5 = $150, and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for 5 x $16 x 1.5 = $120. In total, she can sell them for $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price. So, the profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

Then, on the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the number of vehicles that came in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 รท 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 
Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Distance = 30 miles

Then, Rosie runs 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. We find the distance the same way:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours

2 bags of chips for $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
So the total cost of the food is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee. The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the food. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20.

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to figure out the number of queens and baby bees first. Let's say the number of queens is Q, the number of baby bees is B, and the number of worker bees is W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Since B = 2Q, we can say W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

The total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W: W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the food and non-food items, and then add the tax on the non-food items.

First, let's add up the cost of the food items:
Milk: $2
Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Next, let's add up the cost of the non-food items:
Light bulbs: $3
Cups: $3
Roach traps: $4
Total cost of non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to add the 10% tax on the non-food items. To do this, we multiply the total cost of the non-food items by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%).
$10 x 0.10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items with tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax:
$5 + $11 = $16

"To find out how much profit Kim will make, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total income.

Kim has 8 clients (3 he already has and 5 more he's talking to). Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 
2 bottles of bleach cost 2 x $2 = $4
1 pack of cloths costs $5
So, the total cost for each client is $4 + $5 = $9
For 8 clients, the total cost is 8 x $9 = $72

Kim's total income is $92. To find his profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income.
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to find out how many pineapples John has in total. Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we multiply 10 hectares by 100 pineapples/hectare.

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

This is how many pineapples John has per harvest. But John can harvest his pineapples 4 times a year because there are 12 months in a year and he harvests every 3 months.

12 months/year รท 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year.

1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, so we multiply 500 by 3 to get 1500 pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500 piece one, so we divide 500 by 4 to get 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set:
500 + 1500 = 2000
2000 + 125 = 2125

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To find the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break it down step by step.

First, 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees came back. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees returned.

Next, in the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours left the hive. That's 2 x 30 = 60 bees.

Now, let's think about how many bees left the hive and didn't come back yet. We had 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours, and 15 came back. That leaves 30 - 15 = 15 bees that still haven't come back. Then, 60 more bees left in the next 6 hours. So, in total, 15 + 60 = 75 bees left the hive and hadn't come back yet.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left the hive and hadn't come back yet returned. That's 75 bees.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. So, the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom got $8 in change, that means she paid more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she paid, we need to add the change to the total cost.

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Tim's time is actually more than Steve's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time:

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

First, let's find the total number of tires inflated. 5 people with bicycles had 2 tires each inflated, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. 3 people with tricycles had 3 tires each inflated, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. And 1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated. 

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire: 20 x 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. 

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from $10 to find the change. 
$10 - $6 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know that after the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries, there were 6 fries left (5 that were left behind and 1 that the ants carried off).

Since the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries, that means 1/3 of the fries were left. So, if 6 fries is 1/3 of the total, we can multiply 6 by 3 to find the total number of fries after the pigeons ate.

6 * 3 = 18

Now, we know that the pigeons ate 9 fries, so we add those back to the 18 fries to find the total number of fries after the seagull ate.

18 + 9 = 27

The seagull ate 7 fries, so we add those back to the 27 fries to find the total number of fries after Dave ate.

27 + 7 = 34

Finally, Dave ate 14 fries, so we add those back to the 34 fries to find the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

34 + 14 = 48

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends in class, we need to figure out how many hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo has 3 classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each class is 1 hour long, so that's 3 hours per day. Since he has classes on 3 days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes that are 2 hours long each. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since he has classes on 2 days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

So, in total, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class each week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester. To find the total hours, we multiply 17 hours per week by 16 weeks: 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to add up the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes. 

First, we need to convert the length of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. To convert to feet, we divide by 12: 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. To convert to feet, we divide by 12: 720 / 12 = 60 feet.
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet. This is already in feet, so we don't need to convert.

Now, we add the lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total bananas needed per month is: 
200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total bananas needed per month by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To figure out who ran the most and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Since the football field is 100 yards long, each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards one way and 100 yards back). So, we multiply 15 (the number of times Blake ran back and forth) by 200 yards (the distance of each round trip). This gives us 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards to the line and 40 yards back). So, we multiply 34 (the number of times Kelly ran to the 40-yard line and back) by 80 yards (the distance of each trip). This gives us 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. We add the 200 yards from her first round trip to get 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

The price increases by 20% every 2 months. To find 20% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.20. 

Original price = $20
Price increase every 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Since the price increases every 2 months, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are there in 36 months. 
36 months / 2 months = 18 periods

Now, we can calculate the price after 36 months by adding the price increase 18 times. But that's a lot of work. We can use a shortcut. 

After 2 months, the price will be = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months, the price will be = $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Notice a pattern? The price increase is 20% of the previous price. We can use this pattern to find the price after 36 months.

Let's use a variable, x, to represent the number of white carnations. We can set up an equation: 5x = 200.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5. 

5x / 5 = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we multiply 40 by 4.

4 * 40 = 160

"To find Jean's age, we need to follow the clues given in the problem.

First, we know Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Next, we need to find half of Jan's age two years ago. Half of 28 is 28 / 2 = 14.

The problem says Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago. So, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago. Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Finally, we know Jean is 2 years older than Mark. So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team and then find the difference.

The well-rounded team has all members running at 55 seconds each. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running at 60 seconds, the second runner at 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner at 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner at 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, let's find the difference in time between the two teams:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

However, the question asks how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the well-rounded team is not the fastest, we need to subtract the time of the faster team from the time of the slower team. The less well-rounded team's last runner is actually the fastest, making the less well-rounded team the faster team. So the less well-rounded team will win by:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The correct answer is 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of two different events and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are greater than 3, but we only want numbers greater than 3, so we consider 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5
Probability of rolling an even number on the second roll = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since the two rolls are independent events, we multiply the probabilities to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

Now, we need to find the difference in the probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probabilities = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Difference in probabilities (percentage) = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total number of apples Jenna and her mom picked, we need to find out how many apples Jenna picked and add that to the number of apples her mom picked.

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many apples Jenna picked. 

20 รท 2 = 10

So Jenna picked 10 apples. Now, we add the number of apples Jenna picked (10) to the number of apples her mom picked (20) to get the total number of apples they both picked: 

10 + 20 = 30

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to figure out how many rats there are in total. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been given to the small rodents, and 20 of those pieces went to the rabbits. So, the rats and hamsters got 160 - 20 = 140 pieces of straw.

The hamsters got 5 pieces of straw each, and there are 10 hamsters. So, the hamsters got 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw. Now, we subtract the hamsters' straw from the total straw for the rats and hamsters: 140 - 50 = 90.

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so we divide the total straw for the rats by 6: 90 / 6 = 15. This means there are 15 rats in total.

Since the rats are in 3 cages, and they're divided equally, we divide the total number of rats by 3: 15 / 3 = 5.

Mandy owes $100 and the interest is 2% each month. To find 2% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.02. 

$100 * 0.02 = $2

This is the interest for 1 month. Since Mandy is paying after 3 months, we multiply the interest by 3.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out how much profit he made per bag and then use that to find the total number of bags.

The trader bought each bag for $20 and spent $2 to transport it, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

He sold each bag for $30, so his profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8.

We know he made a total profit of $400, so we can set up an equation to find the number of bags:
8x = 400

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags.

$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Now, let's add up the cost of the tickets, food, and rides:
$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so if John collects peaches for 3 hours, that's 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Since John collects 2 peaches per minute, we multiply 180 minutes by 2 peaches/minute. This is like multiplying 180 by 2.

180 x 2 = 360

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to do a few steps.

First, let's see how many trees Tom plants and chops down in 10 years. He plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees. He chops down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Now, let's find out how many trees he has after 10 years. He starts with 50 trees. He planted 100 trees and chopped down 20 trees, so we add 100 and subtract 20 from 50. That's 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

But then, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3. That's 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees that die.

So, to find out how many trees Tom has left, we subtract 39 from 130. That's 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the neighbors put 18 pink flamingos in Sue's yard on Friday. Then, on Saturday, they took back 1/3 of the flamingos. To find 1/3 of 18, we can divide 18 by 3, which is 6. So, they took back 6 flamingos and painted them white.

Now, we have 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left. On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. To find the total number of pink flamingos, we add 12 + 18 = 30.

We want to know how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos. To find this, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

We know that Jerry has red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.

We also know that Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r'. Then, the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'.

Now, let's think about the total number of eggs. The red chickens lay 3 eggs each, so 'r' red chickens will lay 3r eggs. The white chickens lay 5 eggs each, so 'r + 2' white chickens will lay 5(r + 2) eggs.

We know that the total number of eggs is 42, so we can set up an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

To solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we multiply 5 by (r + 2):

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Now, we combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that both pools are leaking at the same rate, 4 gallons per minute. We also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's call the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago ""x"". Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water.

Since both pools are leaking at the same rate, after 4 minutes, they will both lose the same amount of water. The amount of water lost is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

To solve for x, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we can simplify the right side of the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Next, we can add 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Then, we can subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Finally, we can divide both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, it now has:

Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Harriet is 21 years old now. Since she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these up to find out how many points they scored in total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately, then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles, she did 3 of them and each one takes 10 minutes. So, we multiply 3 x 10 = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles, she did 8 of them and each one takes 5 minutes. So, we multiply 8 x 5 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

"To find out how many liters of water are in the tank now, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to find out how much water was left after Celine used 90 liters. We do this by subtracting 90 from the initial amount of water, which is 120 liters.

Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Next, we need to find out how much rainwater Celine collected. We know that she collected twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, we multiply the water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Finally, we add the water left and the rainwater collected to find the total amount of water in the tank now.

Total water now = Water left + Rainwater collected
Total water now = 30 + 60
Total water now = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to find out how many petunias he plants and add that to the number of geraniums.

Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to find the number of petunias:
90 (geraniums) - 40 = 50 (petunias)

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
90 + 50 = 140

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15000 in the first year. In the second year, they spent one-third of that amount. To find one-third of $15000, we can divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 รท 3 = $5000

So, the company spent $5000 in the second year. Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate how much Carlos and Benji each paid and then add those amounts together.

Carlos rented a canoe for $30 per hour and used it for 3 hours. To find the total cost, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:
$30/hour * 3 hours = $30 * 3 = $90

Benji rented a banana boat raft for $18 per hour and used it for 5 hours. We multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:
$18/hour * 5 hours = $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the costs together to find the total:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (to Rochester by bus) + 3 (return by car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to know the total number of cards and the number of water type cards.

James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left.

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so now he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

New total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to add up the cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

First, let's add up the cost of the meal:
Base burrito: $6.50
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
Total for burrito: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
He also upgraded his meal for $3.00, so we add that too:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Now, we subtract the gift card amount:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can put together in one minute, and then use that to find out how long it will take them to finish the puzzle.

Kalinda can put 4 pieces together in one minute. Her mom can put half as many pieces together as Kalinda, so her mom can put 4 / 2 = 2 pieces together in one minute.

Together, they can put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces together in one minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in one minute:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, it will take them 60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons that were ready at each stage and subtract them from the total.

First, we need to find 30% of 120. To do this, we can multiply 120 by 0.3. 
0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we need to find 3/4 of 84. To do this, we can multiply 84 by 3 and then divide by 4. 
(84 * 3) / 4 = 252 / 4 = 63

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, we find the cost of the cars. Since Mark buys 12 cars for $20,000 each, we multiply 12 by $20,000. 

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we find the tax. The tax is 10% of the cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1.

$240,000 x 0.1 = $24,000

Then, we find the registration fees. Mark pays $1000 for each car, so we multiply $1000 by 12.

$1000 x 12 = $12,000

Finally, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost.

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to find the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants.

Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can divide the number of ants by 2 to find the number of bugs. 
Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs to the number of ants to find the total number of insects:
Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to figure out how many penguins left the group. 

Since one-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean and another one-third went inside the cave, we can calculate the number of penguins that left by finding one-third of 36, which is the total number of penguins.

One-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12. Since two groups of penguins left, we multiply 12 by 2 to get the total number of penguins that left: 12 * 2 = 24.

Now, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

"To figure out how many vines Steve needs, we need to calculate how many tomatoes he and his girlfriend eat in a week. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week, he eats:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, she eats half of what he eats. So, she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week.

Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes/week.

Now, we know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine produces:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"To figure out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to find out how many slices he needs in total. Since there are 20 friends and each friend gets 4 slices, we multiply 20 by 4.

20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Now, we know that each pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.

80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern here. Every time the ink runs low, he can make 1/5 of the total pens into new pens. 

Let's calculate the total number of pens he can make:

25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ... 

This is a geometric series with a first term of 25 and a common ratio of 1/5. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 25 / (4/5)
S = 25 * 5/4
S = 125/4
S = 31.25

However, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we'll round down to 31.

But we are not done yet. We need to add the initial 25 pens to the 31 pens he made from the empty ones, but also the pens he made from those pens, and so on.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 25 + 31 = 56 + 31 = 87 + 31 = 118 + 31 = 149 + 31 = 180 + 31 = 211 + 31 = 242 + 31 = 273 + 31 = 304 + 31 = 335 + 31 = 366 + 31 = 397 + 31 = 428 + 31 =

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to figure out how old each of them is.

We know Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so we add 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25. That's Joan's age.
Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23. That's Mary's age.

Now, we add up their ages: 
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

"To find out how many students went out through exit C, we need to figure out how many went out through exits A and B first.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we multiply 1000 by 0.3. 

1000 * 0.3 = 300

So, 300 students went out through exit A. Now, we subtract 300 from the total number of students to find out how many are left.

1000 - 300 = 700

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 700 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(700 * 3) / 5 = 420

So, 420 students went out through exit B. Now, we subtract 420 from the remaining students to find out how many went out through exit C.

700 - 420 = 280

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies James has, and then compare it to the number of candies John has.

We know that John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, to find out how many candies James has, we can add 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to figure out how many pages he writes and how long it takes him to write those pages.

Mike is pen pals with 3 people. Each of them sends him 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, he gets 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages a week.

Since Mike writes back the same amount, he also writes 30 pages a week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page. So, to write 30 pages, it takes him 30 x 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to divide 180 by 60 to get the number of hours.

15 * 30 = 450 minutes

He also used 300 minutes to talk to other people. So, we add those minutes to the minutes he used to talk to his boss:
450 + 300 = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the minutes he used from his total minutes. Jason has 1000 minutes per month:
1000 - 750 = 250 minutes

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. We also know Colby took 3 less than Kyle's 5 fries, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Now, before Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 27 + 2 = 29 fries.

We know Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.

Before Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had 29 + 10 = 39 fries.

Before Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had 39 + 5 = 44 fries.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries. So, the difference between 44 and 24 is the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

Ginger gave Griffin 44 - 24 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28

This equation can be simplified to 4x = 28, where x is the number of fish in each aquarium. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many hours the makeup artist worked. She worked 6 hours a day, 4 days a week. So, that's 6 * 4 = 24 hours a week. The movie took 5 weeks, so she worked 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so we multiply 120 hours by $250. That's 120 * 250 = $30,000.

But then, the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount. To find 10% of $30,000, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1. That's $30,000 * 0.1 = $3,000.

So, Jean got a $3,000 discount. To find out how much she paid, we subtract the discount from the total. That's $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to know how many cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 x 200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are 30 boys and 30 girls.

The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. So the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

30 * 0.3 = 9

Now, we subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we need to first find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we can multiply 8000 by 0.3.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. 
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together:
300 + 312 = 612
612 + 150 = 762

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in each house and then multiply by the number of houses.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the number of windows in the bedrooms per house is 3 x 2 = 6.

There are also 4 extra windows in each house that aren't in the bedrooms. So, the total number of windows per house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, we multiply the number of windows per house by 2. 10 x 2 = 20.

"To find the change the cashier gives back, we need to add up the cost of the items the mother bought and then subtract that from the $20 she paid.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So the total cost is $15.00. Now, let's subtract that from the $20 she paid:
$20 - $15.00 = $5.00

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to figure out how many stitches the rest of the sweater takes first. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes 1/10 of that, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it's 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so we subtract the stitches we already know: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches. This is the total for both sleeves.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But Sean only has to memorize a third of them, so we need to divide 108 by 3. To do this, we can divide 108 by 3, which is the same as 108 รท 3 = 36. So, Sean has to memorize 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of them. To find four-fifths of 60, we can multiply 60 by 4 and then divide by 5. This is the same as (60 * 4) รท 5 = 240 รท 5 = 48. So, Sean has to memorize 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we can add up the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards remaining after subtracting the cards with A, B, and C.

First, we find the number of cards with A. Since 2/5 of the cards have A, we multiply 80 by 2/5:
80 * 2/5 = 80 * 0.4 = 32

Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total number of cards to find the remaining cards:
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we find the number of cards with B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards have B, we multiply 48 by 1/2:
48 * 1/2 = 48 * 0.5 = 24

Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining cards:
48 - 24 = 24

Then, we find the number of cards with C. Since 5/8 of the rest have C, we multiply 24 by 5/8:
24 * 5/8 = 24 * 0.625 = 15

Now, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining cards to find the number of cards with D:
24 - 15 = 9

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the time for the small holes. Matthew digs 30 small holes, and each one takes 3 minutes. So, we multiply 30 by 3:
30 x 3 = 90 minutes

Next, let's find the time for the large holes. Matthew digs 15 large holes, and each one takes 10 minutes. So, we multiply 15 by 10:
15 x 10 = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes:
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. If we let Sam's age be 'S', then Ruby's age is 6S.

Now, in 9 years, Ruby's age will be 6S + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up an equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

To solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, let's expand the right side of the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, let's get all the S terms on one side of the equation by subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Next, let's get rid of the 9 on the left side by subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Finally, let's solve for S by dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. Since each popsicle costs $0.25, we multiply the number of popsicles (20) by the cost of each popsicle ($0.25). This gives us 20 x $0.25 = $5.

Next, let's find the cost of the ice cream bars. Since each ice cream bar costs $0.50, we multiply the number of ice cream bars (4) by the cost of each ice cream bar ($0.50). This gives us 4 x $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles ($5) and the cost of the ice cream bars ($2) to find the total amount Peter paid. $5 + $2 = $7.

"To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we need to first figure out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

A cobra has 70 spots, so a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined. To do this, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find out how much Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to figure out how many pizzas she needs to buy. 

First, we need to know how many people are coming to the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people. 

Each team member also brings 2 guests, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 guests. 

Now, we add the team members, coaches, and guests: 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide 39 by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs. 39 รท 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply 13 pizzas by $15: 13 x 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads, we need to figure out how much space they take up in the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The necklace is 25 inches long, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches. To find the space left for the silver beads, we subtract 8 from 25: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we can divide 17 by 1/4. This is the same as multiplying 17 by 4, since dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. 

17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories Alani and her siblings wrote, we need to add up the stories they wrote in the first week and the second week.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. So, the total number of stories in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, they each wrote twice as many stories as they did in the first week. This means Alani wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories. The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18 years

Now, we add 3 years to his current age to find his age in 3 years.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 x 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 x 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract these stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows.

Total stars = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40 stars

Since each row has 5 stars, divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds:

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to know its speed and the distance it traveled. 

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, so it's going 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

The car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles. We want to know how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance. We can use the formula time = distance / speed.

time = distance / speed

Since John goes to work 5 days a week, he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.

John works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

The driving service charges $2 per mile, so John pays 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000 per year for the miles driven.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800 per year.

"To find out how much money Theo has left to buy gifts, we need to calculate how much he spent and how much he wants to save.

First, let's add up how much he spent on the business suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600
Then, he bought 3 suitcases for $50 each: 3 * $50 = $150
He also bought a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. A business suit costs $100, so 5 times that is $500. Adding $700 to that makes the ticket $1200.
Now, let's add up all his expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
Theo started with $6000 and wants to save $2000. So, if we subtract his expenses and the amount he wants to save from his total money, we get: $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

"To find out how many eggs the family will eat in a week, we need to figure out how many eggs they eat in a day and then multiply that by 7.

Three people in the family eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. The other two people eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. 

Now, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 13 eggs by 7: 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we add 5 to Jane's age to get Trent's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To find the population of Chile now, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to find out how old Noah and Cera were six years ago. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

Now, we are told that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Finally, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, to find the current population, we multiply the population six years ago by 2. The current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"To find the number of players on the defense, we need to use the information given in the problem.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's D/2.

We know the total number of players is 105. We can write an equation to represent this:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply everything by 2:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Now, we can combine like terms:

7D = 210

To find D, we can divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many people are coming to Martha's party, we need to do some math.

First, let's add up the number of people she invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. Then there are 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, we need to subtract the people who can't come. 8 people are sick, and 1/4 of 8 people have other plans. To find 1/4 of 8, we can divide 8 by 4, which is 2. So, 8 + 2 = 10 people can't come.

Finally, we subtract the people who can't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon initially had 50 marbles. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so now he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and divide by 5. This is (20 * 2) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8 marbles.

Now, Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the total number of kids in the classroom, we need to figure out how many girls and nongendered kids there are, based on the number of boys.

We know there are 30 boys. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, we multiply 30 by 3 to get the number of girls.

Number of girls = 3 x 30
= 90

For the nongendered kids, we know there are 1/10 as many as boys. To find 1/10 of 30, we can divide 30 by 10.

Number of nongendered kids = 30 รท 10
= 3

Now, we add up the number of boys, girls, and nongendered kids to get the total.

Total number of kids = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered kids)

"To find the number of women left, we need to figure out how many people left the party and then how many of those were women.

There were 25 men and 15 women at the party, so 25 + 15 = 40 people in total.

Since 1/4 of the people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. To do this, we can divide 40 by 4, which is 10. So, 10 people left the party.

We know that 22 men stayed, so to find out how many men left, we subtract 22 from the total number of men: 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. To find out how many women left, we subtract the number of men who left from the total number of people who left: 10 - 3 = 7 women left.

Since there were 15 women initially, and 7 left, we subtract 7 from 15 to find the number of women left: 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to figure out how many pencils they have in total. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. So, 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils each box can hold. Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since 2 pencils are loose, the 3 boxes contain 26 - 2 = 24 pencils. If 3 boxes contain 24 pencils, then each box can hold 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.

Now that we know each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils (72) by the number of pencils each box can hold (8). 72 / 8 = 9.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To figure out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to think about the ice cubes and the cream she adds.

First, let's think about the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we can divide 65 by 13. 

65 รท 13 = 5

So, Shannon needs 5 ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's think about the cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes the coffee weaker. To find the total weakening, we add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.

Total weakening = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many old records the 5 people brought in. We know that they left with 7 new records. Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, we can set up a simple ratio.

Let's say the total number of old records is x. Since 2 old records = 1 new record, we can set up a proportion: 2 old records / 1 new record = x old records / 7 new records.

We can simplify this by multiplying both sides by 7 (the number of new records) and then dividing both sides by 1 (the number of new records on the left side). This gives us: x = 7 * 2.

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The company has 100 employees. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. To find 2/5 of 100, we can multiply 100 by 2 and then divide by 5. 

100 * 2 = 200
200 / 5 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. To find the total amount paid to junior programmers, we multiply the number of junior programmers by their monthly pay.

40 * $2000 = $80,000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. To find the total amount paid to senior programmers, we multiply the number of senior programmers by their monthly pay.

60 * $2400 = $144,000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

Before that, at the first stop, 5 people got on. 

We know that after all these stops, there were 20 people on the bus. So, let's work backwards. If we subtract the 1 extra person from the second stop and the 5 people from the first stop, we get:

20 - 1 - 5 = 14

That means 14 people were on the bus when it left the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow what he does step by step.

First, Oscar has 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. So, we subtract 2 from 24, which is 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Then, he gives 14 lollipops to his friends. So, we subtract 14 from 22, which is 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Next, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops, so twice that is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, we add the lollipops he already had (8) to the new ones (28), which is 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After that, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night. So, we subtract 3 from 36, which is 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning. So, we subtract 2 from 33, which is 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Job A:
Nick makes $15 an hour and works 2000 hours a year. So, his total pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year. But, he has to pay 20% in taxes. To find 20% of $30,000, we multiply $30,000 by 0.20, which is $6,000. So, Nick's take-home pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B:
Nick makes $42,000 a year, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax. So, his pay before other taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, he has to pay 10% in taxes. To find 10% of $36,000, we multiply $36,000 by 0.10, which is $3,600. So, Nick's take-home pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's see which job pays more. Job B pays $32,400 and Job A pays $24,000. To find the difference, we subtract $24,000 from $32,400.

Now, let's add the monthly cost of treats ($20) and medicine ($100) to the monthly cost of food ($100).
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.
$220 * 12 = $2640 per year

"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to add up the hours for each activity.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours, which is the same as 30 minutes.
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 0.5 = 4.5
4.5 + 1.5 = 6
6 + 2 = 8

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to figure out how many she needs and subtract that from the number she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. They need twice as many for the roses, which is 2 x 30 = 60. So, they need 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots in total.

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number needed from the number bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we need to figure out the total time he spent on vacation. We know he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours boating and swimming.

He also watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long. So, he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows. Now, we add the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows: 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up an equation: 15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

So, John spent a total of 50 hours on vacation. Now, we need to find 40% of 50, which is the time he spent sightseeing. We can multiply 50 by 0.4: 50 * 0.4 = 20.

"To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she has earned and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours. So, she earns 10 x 20 = $200.

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns 5 x 15 = $75.

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs to her initial savings: $80 + $200 + $75 = $355.

The phone costs $400. To find out how much Annabelle still needs, we subtract the amount she has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to find the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, we add 5 feet to the height of the shortest tree. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and second trees. We add the height of the shortest tree (6 feet) to the height of the second tree (11 feet). So, the combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Finally, we need to find the height of the tallest tree. The problem says that the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, we multiply the combined height (17 feet) by 2. The height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the toys and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had, then add the extra money his mother gave him.

First, let's find the cost of the toy cars. Since each toy car costs $2 and Dean bought 6, we multiply 6 by $2, which is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we find the cost of the teddy bears. Each teddy bear costs $1, and Dean bought 5, so we multiply 5 by $1, which is 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, we add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total cost. $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean started with $28. After buying the toys, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

Then, his mom gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had left. $11 + $10 = $21.

"To find out how much Marisa saves, we need to calculate how much she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops for 25 cents each. To find the total cost of the lollipops, we multiply the number of lollipops by the cost of each lollipop:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents
Since 100 cents is equal to $1, she spends $1 on lollipops every day.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 - $1 = $4
So, Marisa saves $4 every day.

To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:
$4 * 5 = $20

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each. So, the total amount he spent on gumballs is 40 * .05 = $2.

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"To figure out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance it travels in one day. 

The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and then it goes 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs to get back to the first city. The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances of all three legs: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total miles it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total miles it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days.

First, let's find the time it took John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles. So the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's find the time it took John to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

First, 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, some people were kicked out for shoplifting. The problem says it's 4 times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. So, that's 4 x 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 people.

Next, some people were kicked out for fighting. The problem says it's 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, that's 3 x 7 = 21 people.

Now, let's add up the people who were kicked out for these reasons: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors and each frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of the etching. The etching costs 20% more than the frame. To find 20% of $880, we multiply $880 by 0.20. This gives us $176. So, the total cost of the frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's add the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will get pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Finally, we need to add the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will get cords that cost $12 each. To find 1/4 of 44, we can divide 44 by 4. This gives us 11 officers. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she has to pay, including the interest. 

First, let's calculate the interest. The interest rate is 10% per year, but Karan borrowed the money for 5 months, which is less than a year. We need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 10% by 12 to get the monthly rate.

Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12 = 0.008333 (as a decimal)

Now, we multiply the principal amount ($3,650) by the monthly interest rate and the number of months (5) to get the total interest.

Total interest = $3,650 * 0.008333 * 5 = $152.04

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.04
Total Amount = $3,802.04

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:

First, let's find the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount. 
Original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 + $10 = $20
Discount: 20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after discount: $20 - $4 = $16

Now, add the cost of Netflix: 
Total cost of streaming services: $16 + $10 = $26

To find the amount of money saved, subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
Money saved: $60 - $26 = $34

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent on the song.

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of 4 hours, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording it. 
She spent 90 minutes editing it. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 90 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. So, 90 minutes is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time she spent on the song: 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the editing time (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we need to figure out how many books the shelving system can hold and then do some extra math.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of books it can hold: 6 x 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books, which is 2 x 36 = 72.

Wendy wants 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to do some math. 

First, let's add up the cards Erica had. She made 20 cards, and her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards in each box. So, we multiply 2 boxes by 15 cards per box, which is 2 x 15 = 30. Then, we add the 20 cards she made, so 20 + 30 = 50.

Next, we need to subtract the cards she gave away. She gave 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 cards. Now, we subtract 29 from 50, which is 50 - 29 = 21.

Finally, we add the cards she received from family and friends, which is 17. So, 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to figure out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, and then subtract that from the total number of slices, and finally subtract the slices eaten by Jenny.

Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices. To find 1/3 of 12, I can divide 12 by 3, which is 4.

Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices. To find 1/4 of 12, I can divide 12 by 4, which is 3.

So, Bill and Mark got a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Now, we subtract the slices they got from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 = 5 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from 5: 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

"To figure out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the money he already has from the price of the bike. 

The bike costs $300, and Mark already has $50. So, we subtract $50 from $300:

$300 - $50 = $250

This means Mark needs to save $250 more. Since he earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10):

$250 รท $10 = 25

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

First, we know there are 90 spiders. Then, we need to find the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, we can multiply 90 by 1/3. To do this, we can divide 90 by 3.

90 รท 3 = 30

So, there are 30 millipedes. Now, we need to find the number of stink bugs. We know that the number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can multiply 30 by 2 and then subtract 12.

2 * 30 = 60
60 - 12 = 48

There are 48 stink bugs. To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

90 + 30 + 48 = 168

Since John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces, we multiply 2 by 8 to get the total ounces:
2 x 8 = 16 ounces

Now, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce:
16 x 3 = 48

So, John consumed 48 calories."

"To find out how much energy Mel will save, we need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

First, let's find the energy used in one day at the original usage. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the energy used in one day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

We need to convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh). There are 1000 watt-hours in 1 kWh, so:
7200 watt-hours = 7200 / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

Now, let's find the energy used in 30 days at the original usage:
7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

Next, let's find the energy used in one day at the reduced usage. Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, so he uses it for 3 hours a day now. The energy used in one day is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours
2700 watt-hours = 2700 / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

Now, let's find the energy used in 30 days at the reduced usage:
2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

Finally, let's find the energy saved by subtracting the reduced usage from the original usage:
Energy saved = 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh

"To figure out how much money Tyson will spend on meat and cheese, we need to calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make and then multiply that by the cost of the ingredients.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people coming over, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. 20 รท 4 = 5.

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese. $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to follow the information step by step.

First, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can multiply 40 by 2 to find the number of corns. This is 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. To find the new total of cannolis, we add 40 (initial cannolis) and 60 (new cannolis). This is 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

Then, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, we subtract 40 from 100 to find the number of new corns. This is 100 - 40 = 60 new corns.

Now, we add the initial corns (80) and the new corns (60) to find the total number of corns. This is 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, we add the total number of corns (140) and the total number of cannolis (100) to find the combined total. This is 140 + 100 = 240.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to figure out how many steps he took before the jog and then subtract that from the total steps he needed to take.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to figure out how long it takes him to read the book and then subtract that from the time he has before leaving for the airport.

The book has 45 pages and each page has 200 words. To find the total number of words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9,000 words

Toby reads 300 words per minute. To find out how long it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by the number of words he reads per minute:
9,000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he has 60 - 10 = 50 minutes to read the book.

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, we subtract that from the time he has available:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and got paid $15 per hour. So, each employee made $15 * 40 = $600 per week. Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, each employee made $600 * 4 = $2400 in May. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means 1/4 of 40 employees left, which is 10 employees. So, there were 40 - 10 = 30 employees left in June. Each employee still made $600 per week, and $2400 in June. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the total amount paid in May and June. $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

First, let's look at the taffy. Sally bought 2 pounds, and the first pound costs $3. The second pound is half off, so we need to find half of $3. Half of $3 is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50. Then, we add the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so we multiply $0.25 by 4 to get $1.

Now, let's add up the total amount Sally spent: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract $7 from $10: $10 - $7 = $3.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to find 20% of $1200. To do this, we multiply $1200 by 0.20. 
$1200 * 0.20 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

First, let's find out how many candles will explode. Since 99% of the candles won't explode, 1% will. To find 1% of 50000, we multiply 50000 by 0.01. 
50000 * 0.01 = 500 candles will explode.

Next, let's find out how many candles will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles have this problem. To find 5% of 50000, we multiply 50000 by 0.05.
50000 * 0.05 = 2500 candles will smell like wet dog.

Now, we need to find out how many candles will do both things. To do this, we multiply the number of candles that will explode by the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog. But we need to convert the percentage to a decimal first. 5% is the same as 0.05. So we multiply 500 by 0.05.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at how many apples Joanne gathered from the tallest and shortest trees. She gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 x 30 = 60 apples. She also gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 x 15 = 45 apples.

Now, let's add up the apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees. Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples, and her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples. In total, they gathered 45 + 105 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

We know that together they gathered 500 apples. To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to subtract the apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the total. 

500 (total apples) - 150 (apples from tallest and shortest trees) = 350 apples

We also know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, let's solve these two equations. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:
c = 124

This means there are 124 camels. Now, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into the first equation:
124 + d = 180

But this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x. To do this, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

But then, 40 guests showed up, and they all wanted a second hotdog. That means they wanted 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

The caterer only made 54 hotdogs, so he was short 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog is missing one hotdog, 26 guests didn't get a second hotdog.

"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to do a few simple math steps.

First, we know Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. To find half of Indras' name, we divide 6 by 2, which is 3. Then, we add 4 to that, so 3 + 4 = 7. This means her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). So, 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to add up the prices of all the items she bought and then subtract the discount.

First, let's add up the prices:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5 x $5.00): 5 x 5 = 25, so $25.00
Now, let's add these up: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we need to find the discount. The discount is 20% of the total price. To find 20% of a number, we multiply it by 0.20. 
So, the discount is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

First, let's add up the cost of the items: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so we add those together: 
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items: 
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to figure out how many each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 

Prince Arthur slew 3/4 of what Prince Thaddeus slew. To find 3/4 of 100, we multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 4. So, 100 * 3 = 300, and 300 / 4 = 75. Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew 2 times what Prince Arthur slew. So, 2 * 75 = 150. Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew 1/5 of what Prince Walter slew. To find 1/5 of 150, we divide 150 by 5. 150 / 5 = 30.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to find out how many gallons were in each container. We can do this by dividing the total gallons of gas (15) by the number of containers (5). 

15 รท 5 = 3 gallons per container

Next, we need to find out how many gallons Josey needed. We know she needed 1/4 of a container, so we multiply the gallons per container (3) by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 3/4 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the gallons Josey needed (0.75) by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to figure out how much money he spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Since George had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his $5. To find 99% of $5, we can multiply 5 by 0.99, which is $4.95.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars: $3.75 รท 0.75 = 5.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends got, we need to do a few simple math steps.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. We know he had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, we subtract 5 from 25 to get the number of lollipops he shared: 25 - 5 = 20.

Next, we need to divide the number of lollipops he shared (20) by the number of friends he shared them with (4). This will give us the number of lollipops each friend got: 20 รท 4 = 5.

So, each of Ray's friends got 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. To find the weight of each piece, we divide 20 by 8:
20 รท 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:
2 x 2.5 = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:
20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add the number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges everyone will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

First, we need to find the total cost of the onions. Antoine needs 4 pounds of onions (he doubles the 2 pounds the recipe calls for). Onions cost $2.00 a pound, so we multiply 4 pounds by $2.00 to get the total cost of onions: 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so we multiply 2 boxes by $2.00 to get the total cost of beef stock: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of onions and beef stock to get the total cost: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of servings (6 people) to get the cost per serving: $12.00 รท 6 = $2.00.

"To figure this out, we need to know how long it takes Bernadette and Wayne to get to the theater. We know it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get there. Since it takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne, we multiply 4 minutes by 4. 

4 * 4 = 16 minutes

So, it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater. Now, we need to find the difference between their travel times. We subtract Wayne's time from Bernadette's time.

16 - 4 = 12 minutes

But Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we add 5 minutes to the difference.

12 + 5 = 17 minutes

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width. We know the length is 3 yards, but we need to convert it to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we multiply 3 yards by 3 feet per yard to get 9 feet.

We also know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The formula for area is length times width. We can use this to find the width. 

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length (9 feet) and width (40 feet), we can find the perimeter. The formula for perimeter is 2 times the sum of the length and width.

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. To do this, we need to subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. The difference is 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how much the temperature went up when Marcus was baking. He baked for 3 hours, and the temperature went up 5 degrees each hour. So, we multiply 3 hours by 5 degrees per hour, which is 3 x 5 = 15 degrees. Now we add this to the starting temperature of 40 degrees. 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature went down when Marcus opened the window. The window was open for 30 minutes, and the temperature went down 2 degrees every 10 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 3 groups of 10 minutes, we multiply 2 degrees by 3. 2 x 3 = 6 degrees. Now we subtract this from the temperature after baking, which was 55 degrees. 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. To find 10% of 40 minutes, we multiply 40 by 0.1, which is 4 minutes. So, James finished the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. Jon took 80 minutes, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time:
- James' run time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. We know Movie C is 1.25 hours, so we need to convert it to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 1.25 by 60.

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to Movie C.

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to figure out how much hay his horse eats and how much it costs.

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs. We know it runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes รท 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour x 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so we multiply the distance by 1/2:

Total hay = 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so we multiply the total hay by the cost per bail:

Cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

$5 x 6 = $30

Now, we subtract the cost from the total money to find the change:

Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

If you don't buy the super ticket, you save $2. That means you spent $21 - $2 = $19.

The regular movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. So, the ticket and soda together cost $12 + $3 = $15.

Now, let's find the price of the popcorn. You spent $19 in total, and $15 was for the ticket and soda. So, the popcorn costs $19 - $15 = $4.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance it traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's find the distance traveled at 60 mph. We can do this by multiplying the speed (60 mph) by the time (2 hours). 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 2
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's find the distance traveled at 30 mph. We can do this by multiplying the speed (30 mph) by the time (1 hour).

- 15 pairs on Wednesday: 15 x 2 = 30 shoes
- 30 pairs on Friday: 30 x 2 = 60 shoes

Now, let's add all the shoes together:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

But then, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. So, we subtract 180 from 300:
300 - 180 = 120 shoes

Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

"To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to find out how many cupcakes she can decorate with 6 jars of sprinkles. Since each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, we multiply 6 jars by 8 cupcakes per jar.

6 x 8 = 48 cupcakes

Now, we know that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans Mary needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan.

48 รท 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

"To find the change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 she gave the cashier.

First, we know the pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. $1 less than that is $6 - $1 = $5.

So, the total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Theo gave the cashier: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student has 10 pencils, we multiply 30 by 10.
   Total pencils = 30 * 10 = 300 pencils

2. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find 1/5 of 300, we can divide 300 by 5.
   Pencils used = 300 / 5 = 60 pencils

3. Now, we need to find the number of pencils remaining after two months. We subtract the pencils used from the total pencils.
   Remaining pencils = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

4. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find 1/3 of 240, we can divide 240 by 3.
   Pencils left = 240 / 3 = 80 pencils

"To solve this problem, we need to use an equation. Let's say Matt eats 'x' carrot sticks. Since he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 2 from both sides:

x/2 = 3

Then, we'll multiply both sides by 2:

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches. 

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to figure out what fraction of the students don't have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, that means one-fourth of the students don't have one.

We know that 20 students don't have desktop computers, and that's one-fourth of the total number of students. Let's use a variable, 'x', to represent the total number of students. We can set up an equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To figure out how long Jason has to walk each day, we need to know how many days he has to break in his shoes. He has 3 weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week. So, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days he can walk per week.

3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we know Jason has 12 days to break in his shoes. It takes 240 minutes of walking to break them in. To find out how long he has to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days.

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. If we add those numbers together, we get 15. But, we have to remember that 3 kids are allergic to both, so we counted them twice. To fix that, we subtract 3 from 15, which gives us 12 kids who are allergic to at least one thing.

Now, we know there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, we multiply $5000 by 2. 
$5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The hotel costs $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find 20% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 0.2.
$1500 * 0.2 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. To find three-quarters of the weight, we multiply the weight of the 1959 penny by 3 and then divide by 4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = (3 * 48) / 4
Weight of 2010 penny = 144 / 4
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, they eat 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For five days, they will eat 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag of oats has 50 pounds, so Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to us. We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects together. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start with what we know about David and Bodhi. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, if Bodhi found B insects, then David found B/2 insects.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so if David found B/2 insects, then Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

Now, we know that the total number of insects is 43, so we can set up an equation: B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43.

Combine like terms: B + B/2 + B/2 = B + B = 2B, so the equation becomes 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David found: David found B/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find out how many Lily found: Lily found B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16, but that is not correct, we used the wrong value for B/2, we should have used 18, so 18/2 is 9, and 9 + 7 is 16, but we used the wrong value for B, we should have used 36, so 36/2 is 18, and 18 + 7 is 25.

First, we need to find the total distance. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she's running 8 laps, we multiply 8 by 0.25. 

8 x 0.25 = 2 km

Now, we know she needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer. So, we multiply the total distance (2 km) by the amount of water she needs per kilometer (60 ml).

2 km x 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's find 20% of $500. To do this, we multiply $500 by 0.20. This is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left and then multiplying by 20. So, 20% of $500 is $100.

Now, we subtract $100 from $500 to find the remaining money. $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's find 25% of $400. We multiply $400 by 0.25. This is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left and then multiplying by 25. So, 25% of $400 is $100.

Finally, we subtract $100 from $400 to find the amount of money Julie had left. $400 - $100 = $300.

"To find the cost of the house, let's say the lot costs 'x' dollars. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the house costs 3x dollars.

We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write an equation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine the x's:
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3 times 30,000:
3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate how much Tara spent and how much she made.

First, let's find out how much she spent. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack has 5 bags, she bought 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Each bag costs $4, so she spent 40 * $4 = $160.

Next, let's find out how much she made. She sold 40 bags for $8 each, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

Now, let's find the profit. Profit is the money you make minus the money you spend. So, the profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to figure out how many minutes the fight lasted and multiply that by how many punches he throws per minute.

The fight is 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, we multiply the number of rounds by the number of minutes per round:
5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute:
15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to figure out how many Josh made first. We know Josh made 1/4 of what Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

So, Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, Kelsie made 2 times more cookies than Josh. 
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"To find out how much money Ali has left after buying dinner, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. We can multiply the number of bills by the amount on each bill to find the total.

4 x $10 = $40
6 x $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives half of his money to his sister. To find half of $160, we can divide it by 2.

$160 รท 2 = $80
So Ali gives $80 to his sister and keeps $80 for himself.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we can multiply $80 by 3 and then divide by 5.

$80 x 3 = $240
$240 รท 5 = $48
So Ali spends $48 on dinner.

Finally, we need to find out how much money Ali has left. We can subtract the money he spent on dinner from the money he had left after giving some to his sister.

$80 - $48 = $32

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"To find out how many minutes Royce takes to shingle a house, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 2 hours by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. To find double Rob's time, we multiply Rob's time by 2.

2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we add 40 minutes to double Rob's time to find out how many minutes Royce takes.

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Since Martha is making these items for 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the number of skeins needed for each item by 3:
- Hats: 2 * 3 = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 4 * 3 = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 12 * 3 = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 1 * 3 = 3 skeins

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to figure out how many he did each day and subtract that from the total.

On Monday, Chris did 12 problems. On Tuesday, he did 3 times as many as Monday, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 problems. In total, that's 12 + 36 = 48 problems by Tuesday.

Now, we subtract 48 from the total number of problems, which is 100. So, 100 - 48 = 52 problems left after Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Chris did one-quarter of the remaining problems. One-quarter is the same as 1/4, so we need to divide 52 by 4. That's 52 รท 4 = 13 problems.

Now, we add the problems Chris did by Tuesday (48) to the problems he did on Wednesday (13). That's 48 + 13 = 61 problems in total.

Finally, we subtract 61 from the total number of problems, which is 100. So, 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

First, let's add the number of loaves sold in the morning and the afternoon: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, we add the number of loaves returned: 
132 (loaves sold) + 6 (loaves returned) = 138 loaves

Finally, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked:

36 รท 6 = 6

So, Jackson will plant 6 rows of red tulips.

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of tulips (24) by the number of tulips per row (8). This is another division problem:
24 รท 8 = 3

So, Jackson will plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total cups of raisins by 3 since she's dividing them equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we can convert 3/4 to a decimal by dividing 3 by 4. 

3 / 4 = 0.75

Now, we can divide 9 by 0.75 to find the number of batches.

9 / 0.75 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate how much electricity she uses before and after adding the new device.

Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour. So, after adding the new device, she will use 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply the hourly usage by 24 to get the daily usage. 

Daily usage before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 288 kilowatts
Daily usage after adding the new device: 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 336 kilowatts

Since we want to know the weekly usage, we multiply the daily usage by 7.

Weekly usage before adding the new device: 288 kilowatts * 7 = 2016 kilowatts
Weekly usage after adding the new device: 336 kilowatts * 7 = 2352 kilowatts

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt. We multiply the weekly usage by the cost per kilowatt to get the weekly electric bill.

Weekly electric bill before adding the new device: 2016 kilowatts * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly electric bill after adding the new device: 2352 kilowatts * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is the difference between the two amounts.

Difference in weekly electric bill: $3528 - $3024 = $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it would take one person to paint a whole house, and then divide that by the number of people painting.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (because a whole house is twice as big as half a house).

There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, five people can do it in less time. To find out how long it would take five people, we divide 240 hours by 5.

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to figure out how many chairs and sofas Ophelia and Jenna have.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we add 2 to 20 to find the number of chairs she has. So, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. To find the number of chairs Jenna has, we multiply Ophelia's chairs by 3. Jenna has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from 66 to find the number of sofas she has. Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we add up all the sofas and chairs:
Ophelia's sofas: 20
Jenna's sofas: 64
Total sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's chairs: 66
Total chairs: 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break it down step by step.

First, we start with 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 people get off, so we subtract 8 from 48:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, we multiply 8 by 5:
8 * 5 = 40
So, 40 people get on the bus. Now we add the people who were already on the bus to the new people:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 people get off, so we subtract 21 from 80:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, we divide 21 by 3:
21 / 3 = 7

The number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"To find out how many years separate Jame and his cousin's age now, we need to figure out their current ages.

First, we know Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, to find his current age, we subtract 5 from 27. That's 27 - 5 = 22. Jame is 22 years old now.

Next, we know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since he will be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55. That's 55 - 8 = 47. Jame's cousin is 47 years old now.

Finally, to find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age. That's 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so we can divide it into two halves: the first 15 days and the second 15 days.

Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can write this as an equation:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

Then, we find the cost of the fruit drinks. She bought 5 cans at $2 each, so we multiply 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, we add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly paid with a $50 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from $50: $50 - $33 = $17.

"To find out how much Antonella earned, we need to calculate her commission. 

First, let's find out how much commission she earned from the first $1000. She gets 30% of that. To find 30% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.30.
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

Now, let's find out how much commission she earned from the remaining $1500. She gets 40% of that (30% + 10%). To find 40% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 0.40.
$1500 * 0.40 = $600

Now, we add the commission from the first $1000 and the remaining $1500 to find the total commission.
$300 + $600 = $900

"To figure out how many more water bottles Bill needs, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many bottles he wants for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest. So, we multiply 70 (guests) by 2 (bottles per guest): 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles he already has. He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles in each case. So, we multiply 2 (cases) by 24 (bottles per case): 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we need to figure out how long it takes him to swim a mile on both days.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. We'll assume this is the same for hot water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To figure out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much he earns per week. 

John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are $2 * 5 = $10 per day. 

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are $10 * 4 = $40 per week.

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40). 

$80 รท $40 = 2

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both subs and add them together.

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. So, we multiply $40 by 3 to get the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

$40 * 3 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs together.

$40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes. There were 7 buttons with 2 holes, so we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14 holes

Next, we need to find the number of buttons with 4 holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total, and 7 had 2 holes, we subtract 7 from 21 to find the number of buttons with 4 holes:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Now, we multiply the number of buttons with 4 holes by 4 to find the total number of holes:
14 * 4 = 56 holes

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons:
14 + 56 = 70 holes

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker = Timothy's locker / 2
Zack's locker = 24 / 2
Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4 or divide it by 4.

Peter's locker = Zack's locker / 4
Peter's locker = 12 / 4
Peter's locker = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to figure out how many cups he drinks now and subtract the daily recommendation.

The daily recommendation is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that, which is 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Now, we subtract the daily recommendation from what Juan drinks: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. 

First, let's find the number of hamsters. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters in each cage. So, the number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.

Next, let's find the number of guinea pigs. There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs in each cage. So, the number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents. 
30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to add up their weights and divide by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so we subtract 20 from 150 to get Susan's weight: 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2: 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

Now, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 รท 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the angle the sun has moved to the initial angle of the pyramid. 

The pyramid is at 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees every hour. Since it moves for 10 hours, we multiply 5 degrees by 10 hours to get the total angle it moved: 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we add the angle the sun moved (50 degrees) to the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees): 50 + 32 = 82 degrees.

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to figure out how many candles he needs. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 รท 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 pages = 70 pages * 2 / 1.5 = 140 / 1.5 = 93.33 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 93.33 + 100 = 193.33 pages. Since you can't read a fraction of a page, we round down to 193 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to figure out how many Cody and Trevor ate. 

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches. To find 1/3 of 12, we can divide 12 by 3. 12 รท 3 = 4. So Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches. To find 1/4 of 12, we can divide 12 by 4. 12 รท 4 = 3. So Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the sandwiches they ate: 4 + 3 = 7. They ate 7 sandwiches in total.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to figure out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years and then use that to find the nephew's age.

Shiloh is 44 years old now, so in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. We can write this as an equation: 51 = 3 * (nephew's age in 7 years).

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we need to divide 51 by 3. This gives us 51 รท 3 = 17.

So, the nephew will be 17 years old in 7 years. To find his current age, we subtract 7 from 17: 17 - 7 = 10.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Sharon got $5 for the first tooth. Then, she got $1 for each of the next three teeth. So, that's 3 x $1 = $3. Now, add the $5 to that, and we get $5 + $3 = $8.

For the last two teeth, Sharon got half of what she got for each of the previous three teeth. Since she got $1 for each of those teeth, half of $1 is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, she got 2 x $0.50 = $1.

Now, let's add everything together: $8 + $1 = $9.

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to figure out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. We know Richie scored 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's score by subtracting 20 from Richie's score:
Mark's score = 80 - 20
Mark's score = 60

We also know Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can find Anna's score by subtracting 45 from Richie's score:
Anna's score = 80 - 45
Anna's score = 35

Now, we add up all their scores to find the total:
Total goals = Richie's score + Mark's score + Anna's score
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he can spend $70 รท 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he can buy $10 รท $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day for 4 days. The total number of wooden action figures he can buy is 2 ร 4 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he can buy $10 รท $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days. The total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 5 ร 3 = 15.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's find out how many roses the flower shops order per week. 
The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 
So, the total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Now, let's find out how many roses Ford grows per month. 
Ford grows 40 roses every week. 
So, the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

So, we multiply the total number of crayons by 8 to find the total number of small pieces, then divide that by 8 to find the number of muffin crayons. But that's the same as just using the total number of crayons.

192 / 8 = 24, then multiply that by the number of small pieces per crayon, but we assumed that was 8, so 24 * 8 = 192, then divide that by 8, which is 24. So we can just divide 192 by 8.

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet.

First, we need to find the area of the bedroom. The area is the length times the width. The length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost to remove the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost to install the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, we need to add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

Let's add them up: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of birds by 7: 280 รท 7 = 40.

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

First, we need to find half of the starting value, which is 20. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10.

Next, we add the starting value and half the number, which is 20 + 10 = 30.

Then, we divide the result by 5, which is 30 / 5 = 6.

After that, we subtract 12 from the starting value, which is 20 - 12 = 8.

Finally, we multiply the result from the division by the result from the subtraction, which is 6 * 8 = 48.

Final answer: 48"
"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have, we need to add the number of cards each of them has.

The boy has 5 cards. Since his brother has 3 fewer cards than him, we subtract 3 from 5 to find the number of cards the brother has: 
5 - 3 = 2

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: 
5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To figure out the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to find out how much it's off when she sets it to 450. 

When she sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. To find the difference, we subtract 450 from 468, which is 18. 

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 is of 450. To do this, we divide 18 by 450, which is 0.04. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, which is 4%.

This means her oven is 4% off. Now, we need to find the temperature she should set it to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees.

Let's call the temperature she should set it to 'x'. Since her oven is 4% off, the actual temperature will be x + 4% of x. We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up an equation:

x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can add 60 minutes to the 30 minutes. 
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 2 hours by 60 minutes per hour.
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Then, we add the 5 minutes to get the total time for the second movie.
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time for both movies.
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. 
$76,000 * 0.3 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find Juan's house value.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of both houses combined is the sum of their individual values.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to figure out how many cups and dishes Judy and her friend brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes:
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Her friend's cups: 40
Her friend's dishes: 44

Total cups: 12 + 40 = 52
Total dishes: 24 + 44 = 68

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to figure out how much 2 boxes of contacts cost and then divide that by the total number of contacts.

First, we need to find the cost of 1 box. It's $100, but it's 10% off. To find 10% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.10, which is $10. So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, we multiply the cost of 1 box by 2: $90 * 2 = $180.

Now, we need to find the total number of contacts. 1 box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts has 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is $1 * 2 = $2.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to figure out how many hours each of them worked and multiply that by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they get paid $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 x $10 = $30 and John earned 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. So, $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She did aerobics for 2 hours, which burns 500 calories per hour. So, she burned 2 x 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She also ran for 1 hour, which burns 600 calories per hour. So, she burned 1 x 600 = 600 calories running.

The total calories she burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide 1600 by 200. 1600 รท 200 = 8.

This means she needs 8 times the amount of water for 200 calories. So, 8 x 100 ml = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying B by 0.99 (which is the same as 1 - 0.01, or 1% less). So, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B.

The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we multiply B by 1.01 (which is the same as 1 + 0.01, or 1% more). So, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans and the number of green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the difference in weight, we need to figure out how much weight Martin will lose if he eats Cheerios and how much weight he will gain if he eats donuts.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. To find out how much he loses in 5 weeks, we multiply 1.25 by 5. That's 1.25 x 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. To find out how much he gains in 5 weeks, we multiply 1.75 by 5. That's 1.75 x 5 = 8.75 pounds.

Now, we need to find the difference between the weight gain and weight loss. Since he loses 6.25 pounds with Cheerios and gains 8.75 pounds with donuts, we add the two numbers together: 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

Then, Alex called 10 friends, and they're coming too. 8 of those friends are bringing their spouses, so that's 8 more people.

Now, let's add up all the people:

"To solve this problem, we need to track the height of the beanstalk each day. The beanstalk doubles its height every day, so we can start with its initial height of 4 feet.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 x 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 x 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 x 2 = 32 feet

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk needs to be at least 21 feet tall to be taller than the window. On Day 3, the beanstalk is 16 feet, which is still shorter than the window. However, on Day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the window.

So, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to figure out how much protein is in the mushrooms he eats each day and then multiply that by 7.

First, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, we can set up a ratio to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms.

If 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms has 2 times as much protein, because 200 is 2 times 100. So, 200 grams of mushrooms has 2 x 3 = 6 grams of protein.

Now, we multiply the amount of protein John gets each day (6 grams) by the number of days in a week (7). 

6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams

"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we call Jerry's current age 'x', then 5 years ago, he was 'x - 5' years old. Since he's twice as old now, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll multiply the 2 by the terms inside the parentheses:

x = 2x - 10

Next, we'll subtract 'x' from both sides to get all the 'x's on one side:

0 = x - 10

Then, we'll add 10 to both sides to solve for 'x':

10 = x

So Jerry is 10 years old now. To find out how old he'll be in 3 years, we just add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

George already paid $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900. George makes $15 per hour, so we divide the amount he needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15).

$3900 รท $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the fact that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. We also know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's call the smallest angle x. Then, the second angle is 2x, and the third angle is 3x. We can write an equation based on the fact that the three angles add up to 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine the x terms:

6x = 180

Now, divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, we can find the other two angles:

Second angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
Third angle (largest): 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

400 miles / 2 miles = 200 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of rotations per interval:
200 intervals * 725 rotations/interval = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of rotations per month by 12:

The tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find the number of years, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to know how many pumps are in the bottle. The directions say 2 pumps give 120 washings. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. Now, we can find the cost per pump.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = 10 cents

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the discount and subtract it from the initial $50.

First, we add the cost of the shirt and the shorts: $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to find 30% of $60. To do this, we multiply $60 by 0.3 (because 30% is the same as 0.3). So, 0.3 * $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial $50 to find out how much money Joe will have left: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we need to figure out how much butter he needs per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply 1/4 by 4 to find out how much butter he needs per day. 

1/4 * 4 = 1 pound of butter per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 1 pound by 7 to find the total amount of butter needed.

1 * 7 = 7 pounds of butter.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street. Since it costs $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long, we multiply 150 by 194.

150 x 194 = $29,100

Now, let's calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street. His street is 490 meters long, so we multiply 490 by 194.

490 x 194 = $95,060

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the first 5 months is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month. The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than this, which is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The first player had a 6-ounce steak. The second player had 8 beef tips, and each tip was 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third player had a 1-pound steak. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, the third player had 16 ounces.

Now, let's add them up: 
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players didn't eat any meat, so we don't need to add anything for them.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, to find out how much he sells in a day, we multiply 15kg by 10 hours:

15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg per day

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

"To find the number of students in the auditorium, we need to figure out how many seats were taken by the administrators and parents first.

There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is 4 x 18 = 72.

One-fourth of the seats were taken by the administrators. To find one-fourth of 72, we can divide 72 by 4. 72 รท 4 = 18. So, the administrators took 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats. 72 - 18 = 54.

One-third of the remaining seats were taken by the parents. To find one-third of 54, we can divide 54 by 3. 54 รท 3 = 18. So, the parents took 18 seats.

Finally, we subtract the seats taken by the parents from the remaining seats to find the seats taken by the students. 54 - 18 = 36.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to figure out how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. Since school lasts 8 hours, we can divide 8 by 2 to find out how many pieces he chews at school. 8 / 2 = 4.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, we add those to the 4 pieces he chewed at school: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find half of 14, we can divide 14 by 2: 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

The number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."

"To find out how much James made, we need to figure out the profit the company made on each car and then find James' commission.

The company sold each car for $25,000. They paid 30% of that price to get the cars. To find 30% of $25,000, we multiply $25,000 by 0.3. That's $25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500. So, the company paid $7,500 for each car.

The profit on each car is the selling price minus the cost price. That's $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets 10% of the profit as his commission. To find 10% of $175,000, we multiply $175,000 by 0.1. That's $175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500.

First, we know the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. To find 4/5 of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 4 and then divide by 5:
$2000 * 4 = $8000
$8000 / 5 = $1600

So, the price of the gold jewel is $1600.

Next, we know the price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. To find the price of the silver jewel, we subtract $400 from $1600:
$1600 - $400 = $1200

Time = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to figure out how many people are in his class, including himself and the teacher. Then, we multiply that number by 2, since he's getting 2 cupcakes for each person.

There are 25 classmates, plus 1 teacher, and 1 Howie. So, the total number of people is 25 + 1 + 1 = 27. 

Since Howie is getting 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply 27 by 2. This is like adding 27 + 27, which equals 54.

"To find the total number of likes, we need to calculate the number of likes after 4 weeks and then add the 20000 new likes.

First, we know Fishio got 2000 likes after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we multiply 2000 by 70 to get the number of likes after 4 weeks.
2000 * 70 = 140000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 4 weeks.
140000 + 20000 = 160000.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 x $20 = $400. But she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid is $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate went up to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 x $30 = $600. There was a 10% discount on the total cost. To find 10% of $600, we multiply $600 by 0.1, which is $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices. To do this, we subtract the smaller number from the bigger number: $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to find the total sales for the first month and the second month.

First, we need to find the sales from green hats. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, and that's half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, the sales from green hats are 2 times the sales from red hats.

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * 400
Sales from green hats = 800

Now, we can find the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red hats and green hats.

Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find 3/4 of the total sales, we can multiply the total sales by 3 and then divide by 4.

Total sales for the second month = (3/4) * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = (3/4) * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total sales for the first month and the second month.

Total amount she made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, we know that 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. So, to find out how many eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Finally, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the number of eggs by 12.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to add up the cost of the plane and the cost of keeping it for a year.

The plane cost $150,000. James pays $5,000 a month to rent a hangar, so for a year that's $5,000 * 12 = $60,000. He also spends twice as much on fuel, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 a month. For a year, that's $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hangar) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. 
Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking time for each item: 
30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to use two equations. Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G.

We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write an equation:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that each animal has one head, and the total number of heads is 20. So, we can write another equation:
S + G = 20

Now, we can solve these equations. First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the G terms the same:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, subtract this equation from the first equation:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to:
2S = 30

Now, divide both sides by 2:
S = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.2. 
$5 * 0.2 = $1.
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days. He uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he buys 7 pounds of coffee.
The cost of 7 pounds of coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

4 * 2 = 8 hours per week

Since the class is 6 weeks long, we multiply 8 hours per week by 6 weeks.

8 * 6 = 48 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. We can start by using variables to represent their ages. Let's say the age of one twin is T and the age of one triplet is t.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there are two twins and three triplets, so their combined ages are 2T (for the twins) and 3t (for the triplets). The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate how many coins each of them saves per month and then multiply it by the number of months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and divide by 5. 
2/5 of 20 = (20 * 2) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to get the yearly savings.
Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.
Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they have been saving for 10 years, we multiply the yearly savings by 10.
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings.
Total coins = 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total bill for his dog's vet visit. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each. So, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of x, and the vaccines are $40. So, we can set up an equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Then we can divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits.

First, we need to find the price of a banana. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, and an apple costs $0.5, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we need to find the price of an orange. Since an orange costs three times as much as a banana, and a banana costs $1, an orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to find out how many squares of each color she has and add them together.

First, we know she has 14 red squares. Then, she has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Next, she has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Finally, she has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add the number of squares together: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To figure out how many more chairs Mia needs, we need to know how many chairs she already has and how many people are coming to the function.

Mia has 8 high chairs, and she has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, let's add the regular chairs and high chairs: 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

There are 42 adults and 15 babies coming to the function, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

Since Mia has 48 chairs and 57 people are coming, she needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

"To figure out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students.

Adam has 50 points. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. To find 30% of 50, I'll multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. To find this, I'll multiply 35 by 3, which is 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. To find 50% of $2400.00, we multiply $2400.00 by 0.5. 
$2400.00 * 0.5 = $1200.00

She also uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment. To find 20% of $2400.00, we multiply $2400.00 by 0.2.
$2400.00 * 0.2 = $480.00

Now, we add the money she puts into her retirement account and the money she spends on her car.
$1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of city fireworks she can see and add the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's find the total number of city fireworks. There are 15 boxes with 20 fireworks in each box. We can multiply 15 and 20 to find the total: 15 x 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 รท 100 = 0.4. Then, we multiply 0.4 by 300: 0.4 x 300 = 120.

Now, let's find the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes with 5 fireworks in each box. We can multiply 3 and 5 to find the total: 3 x 5 = 15.

First, we need to know how many people are in the group. Aiden and 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet 7 more friends there. So, the total number of people is:
Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Each person gets 2 drinks and 3 snacks. To find the total number of drinks and snacks, we multiply the number of people by the number of drinks and snacks each person gets:
Drinks: 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Snacks: 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Now, we add the total number of drinks and snacks:

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that all three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. So, the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total weight that all three trucks can carry.

When her arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. She does this for 2 minutes, so we multiply 200 taps/minute by 2 minutes and by 2 feet (since she has two feet):
200 taps/minute * 2 minutes * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with one foot and 250 times per minute with the other. We add these two numbers together to get 550 taps/minute. She does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), so we multiply 550 taps/minute by 3 minutes:

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 

Let's say the length of one of Bobby's shoes is x. Then, the equation becomes:
9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
9x = 90

Next, divide both sides by 9:
x = 90 / 9

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's find the total number of windows for students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. So, the total number of windows is 64 x 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to divide 256 by 4. 256 รท 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the total number of windows for teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. So, the total number of windows is 32 x 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4. 64 x 3 = 192, and 192 รท 4 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars. 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00, we need to figure out how many people voted by that time. 

First, we know that 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find 2/5 of 5000, we can multiply 5000 by 2 and then divide by 5. 

(5000 * 2) / 5 = 10000 / 5 = 2000

So, 2000 people voted by midday. Now, we subtract 2000 from 5000 to find out how many people were left.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find 2/3 of 3000, we can multiply 3000 by 2 and then divide by 3.

(3000 * 2) / 3 = 6000 / 3 = 2000

Now, we know that 2000 people voted by midday and another 2000 people voted by 16:00. So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 + 2000 = 4000.

To find the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00, we subtract 4000 from 5000.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate each of their ages.

Dora is 15 years old. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8.

Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
= 30 + 8
= 38 years

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age.

Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to first find out how many votes candidates A and B got.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. So, 100 * 0.2 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5. So, 20 * 0.5 = 10 votes. Then, we add 10 votes to candidate A's votes. So, 20 + 10 = 30 votes for candidate B.

Now, we add the votes of candidates A and B. 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, we subtract the votes of candidates A and B from 100 to find candidate C's votes. 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Beck has compared to Boris after Boris gives Beck some apples.

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find out how many apples Boris has left, we subtract 10 from 100: 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes. Since each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water, and Peter made 3 giant cubes, we multiply 3 by 4 to get 12 ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes. Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water, and Peter made 7 medium cubes. So, we multiply 7 by 2 to get 14 ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes. Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water, and Peter made 8 small cubes. To multiply 8 by 0.5, we can multiply 8 by 1 and then divide by 2, which gives us 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9, which is 27. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons. She also has 40 large stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

Since 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. So she has 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons.

We can convert the large buttons to small buttons too. Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

Now she has 63 + 87 = 150 small buttons.

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we can convert the small buttons to large buttons and small buttons. 150 / 3 = 50 large buttons. But since we can't have a fraction of a button, we can have 50 large buttons (50 * 3 = 150) or 150 small buttons. The question asks for the total number of buttons, so we can consider the large buttons and small buttons.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 x $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 x $15 = $30. She doesn't get the extra $5 because she teaches less than 4 classes.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The perfume company has 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each, so we multiply 4 x 5 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

They have 8 fruity scents and they sold 2 of each, so we multiply 8 x 2 = 16 fruity scents sold.

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each. To find the total amount of money he made, we multiply the number of eggplants by the price of each eggplant: 20 * 3 = $60.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from the eggplants, we subtract $60 from $135 to find out how much more money he needs to make: $135 - $60 = $75.

Now, we know that Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find the price of each ear of corn, we divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 รท 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to find the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so the total time is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so we subtract that from the total time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Then, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. To find 1/3 of 9 hours, we can divide 9 by 3: 9 รท 3 = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent playing video games from the remaining time: 9 - 3 = 6 hours. This is the time she spends playing soccer.

To find the percentage, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100: (6 รท 12) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to do some math. 

First, Anthony had 50 pencils and gave half of them to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. Now, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3 and then divide by 5. 
25 * 3 = 75
75 / 5 = 15

So, he gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to figure out how long it takes him to drive to the museum, how long he spends at the museum, and how long it takes him to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Jack to drive to the museum. We know the distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, it also takes him 2 hours to drive back. So, the total time Jack spends driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

We also know Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we need to figure out how many wheels Henry needs for the cars and motorcycles. 

First, let's calculate the wheels needed for the cars. Since each car needs 4 wheels, we multiply the number of cars (57) by 4. 
57 * 4 = 228 wheels

Next, we calculate the wheels needed for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so we multiply the number of motorcycles (73) by 2.
73 * 2 = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed.
228 + 146 = 374 wheels

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into parts.

First, we know that 1/3 of his 600 movies are in series. To find 1/3 of 600, we can divide 600 by 3. 
600 รท 3 = 200 movies

These movies cost 1/6 of the normal price, which is $10. To find 1/6 of $10, we can divide $10 by 6. 
$10 รท 6 = $1.67 per movie

Now, we multiply the number of movies in series by the cost per movie: 
200 * $1.67 = $334

Next, we find the number of remaining movies: 
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies. To find 40% of 400, we can multiply 400 by 0.4. 
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

These older movies cost $5 each. We multiply the number of older movies by the cost per movie: 
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies. These movies cost $10 each. We multiply the number of remaining movies by the cost per movie: 
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the total cost: 
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

The final answer is: $3534"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, we need to find the time they spent driving. They spent a total of 6 hours, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking. So, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Next, we can find the distance driven. We know their average driving speed is 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's find their hiking speed. We know it's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 less than that is 20 miles per hour.

We can now find the distance hiked. We multiply the hiking speed by the time spent hiking: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Finally, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored.

Ava gets 10 points for every enemy she jumps on, 5 points for each berry she collects, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level. Emma gets the same points.

Let's say Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Ava also collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

For enemies, Emma gets 10x points and Ava gets 10(x + 8) points. This is the same as 10x + 80 points for Ava.

For berries, Emma gets 5y points and Ava gets 5(y + 3) points. This is the same as 5y + 15 points for Ava.

For time, let's say Emma finishes the level in 't' seconds. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so Ava finishes the level in 't - 4' seconds. Emma gets 30t points and Ava gets 30(t - 4) points. This is the same as 30t - 120 points for Ava.

Now, let's add up the points for Emma and Ava:
Emma: 10x + 5y + 30t
Ava: 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120
Ava: 10x + 5y + 30t - 25

The difference between their scores is Ava's score minus Emma's score:

The difference between their scores is -25."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars together cost 30 dollars. 

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break it down into two parts: the usual days and the other two days.

On the usual 5 days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day. So, we multiply the number of days by the number of rides per day:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as many times as they do on the usual days. Since they ride 3 times on a usual day, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times on the other days. We multiply the number of other days by the number of rides per day:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other days to get the total number of rides in a week:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bob had 7 fish initially: 3 orange and 4 white. He bought 17 more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x (since he bought 17 fish in total).

We know that the total number of orange fish he has now is twice the total number of white fish. So, we can set up an equation:

(3 + (17 - x)) = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - 8 = 3x

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to figure out how much gas he uses. 

First, we need to find out how many miles he drives in a week. He drives to work and back home, so that's 2 trips a day. Each trip is 5 miles, so he drives 2 * 5 = 10 miles a day. He does this 5 days a week, so he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we need to find out how much gas he uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so we divide the miles he drives by 10. 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons he uses by the price. 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

First, let's find the amount spent from the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by $0.25:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the 10 twenties. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5:
(10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 6 by $20:

Since there are 400 fifth graders, the number of fifth graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's add up the number of students who passed: 
340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700.

Next, let's find the total number of students: 
500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 
700/1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to figure out how many square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has 2 x 72 = 144 chips in total.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total square inches. 144 รท 12 = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, and we want to find the length. To do this, we can use the formula for area (area = length x width). In this case, the area is 12 square inches, and the width (or height) is 3 inches. We can rearrange the formula to solve for length: length = area รท width.

So, the length of the mosaic will be 12 รท 3 = 4 inches.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the party, we need to figure out how many quarts of tea were consumed and add that to the amount left over.

First, let's calculate how much tea the four students drank. They each drank 1.5 quarts, so we multiply 4 by 1.5:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate how much tea the 16 students drank. They each drank 2 quarts, so we multiply 16 by 2:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

Now, we add the amount of tea the two groups drank:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

We also know that there are 10 quarts of tea left over. To find the total amount of tea at the party, we add the amount consumed to the amount left over:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 รท 4 = 12 gallons

"To figure out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to find out how many he has in total and subtract the number he's already sold.

Dale started with 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

He's already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number sold from the total:
200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To find the total number of students at the end of May, we need to double the number of students 5 times (from January to May).

1. January: 10 * 2 = 20
2. February: 20 * 2 = 40
3. March: 40 * 2 = 80
4. April: 80 * 2 = 160
5. May: 160 * 2 = 320

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May.

Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many branches he climbed in total. We know he made $105 and each branch costs $0.25. To find the total number of branches, we divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches by 7 to find the average branches per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First, let's find the total number of petals from each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up all the petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to subtract the marshmallows they used and dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

First, let's add the number of S'mores John and DeSean made. They each made 9 S'mores, so 9 + 9 = 18. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

Now, let's add the marshmallows they used and dropped: 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21.

The bag had 35 marshmallows initially. To find out how many are left, we subtract the marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, we'll divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have: 14 รท 2 = 7.

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate how many quarters each person used and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. To find out how many quarters Jack used, we divide 240 minutes by 20 minutes per quarter. That's 240 รท 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of Jack's friends are not as good and can only play for half as long, which is 10 minutes per quarter. They play for 240 minutes, so we divide 240 by 10. That's 240 รท 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, we multiply 24 by 2. That's 24 ร 2 = 48 quarters.

One of Jack's friends is really good and can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 30 minutes per quarter. They play for 240 minutes, so we divide 240 by 30. That's 240 รท 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 68 by $0.25. That's 68 ร $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the ingredients Tanya uses to make her salt scrub. We know she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of zest is x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x, the amount of salt is 2x, the amount of sugar is 2x, and the amount of oil is 4x (twice the amount of salt).

We know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can add up all the ingredients:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:

10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 1

Now, we know the amount of oil is 4x, so:

Oil = 4 * 1 = 4

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cars Joe has. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we can multiply 40 by 0.2. This gives us 40 x 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from the total number of cars he had. So, we subtract 8 (cars sold) and 16 (cars given away) from 40 (total cars). This gives us 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Half of 8 hours is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Then, we need to find half of 70 because half of the cars left. To do this, we can divide 70 by 2. 70 / 2 = 35.

So, half of the cars left, which means 35 cars left the parking lot. To find the number of cars that stayed, we subtract 35 from 70. 70 - 35 = 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much he makes per cycle. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, we multiply the number of tasks by the amount each task pays:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Next, we need to find out how much he makes in a day. John does 30 cycles a day, so we multiply the amount he makes per cycle by the number of cycles:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

Finally, we need to find out how much he makes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds. So, the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. They also charge $0.08 per mile and the distribution center is 20 miles away. So, the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75. So, the refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the book cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost. So, the total loss is $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to add up the time she spends on three things: recording videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup.

First, let's calculate the time spent recording videos. 
Britany records 18 videos a week, and each video is 4 minutes long. 
18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 72 minutes by 4.
72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

Next, let's calculate the time spent writing songs. 
Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. 
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 2 hours by 4.
2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
We need to convert hours to minutes, so we multiply 8 hours by 60.

Lastly, let's calculate the time spent on makeup. 
Britany spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. 
15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 90 minutes by 4.
90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam had initially and then subtract the slices he ate.

First, let's find out how many slices the large apples will make. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam sliced 3 large apples, we multiply 3 (number of large apples) by 5 (number of slices per large apple). This gives us 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's find out how many slices the small apples will make. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam sliced 5 small apples, we multiply 5 (number of small apples) by 3 (number of slices per small apple). This gives us 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices Adam had initially. This is 15 (large apple slices) + 15 (small apple slices) = 30 slices.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length used, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm. 
5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm used.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length used, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm used.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length used, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm. 
1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm used.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total used length.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Jack collected 60 dishes. We also know he collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if we divide the number of dishes by 2, we can find out how many socks he has. 

60 รท 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, we multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2.

30 x 2 = 60 socks

We also know Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, we divide the number of dishes Jack has by 2.

60 รท 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90
Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students good at both math and English can be found by subtracting the students who are good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at both math and English = Total students - (students good at math only + students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = students good at math only + students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

"To figure out how many groups can perform, we need to know how long the concert is and how long each group takes. The concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. There's a 10-minute break, so we subtract that: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off stage. That's 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we divide the total time by the time per group: 110 / 10 = 11.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find three-quarters of $300, we multiply $300 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

$300 * 3 = $900
$900 / 4 = $225

So, Brenda earns $225 in interest each year. Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. To find the total interest earned in 3 years, we multiply the interest earned each year by 3.

$225 * 3 = $675

Now, add the total interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half don't have collars. Half of 40 is 20, so there are 20 white shirts with collars and 20 white shirts with no collars.

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts. 50 - 20 = 30, so there are 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. To do this, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons. 30 - 20 = 10.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes a year.

We know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost of each pair, we divide the total amount he spends ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys (24).

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 3 baskets of green food. Since each basket costs $25, we multiply 3 by $25, which is $75.

Next, let's find the cost of 3 baskets of red food. Each basket costs $18, so we multiply 3 by $18, which is $54. But we get a discount of $2 for each basket of red food, so we subtract $6 (3 x $2) from $54. This gives us $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets together: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes. This means they will build 96 new homes in the third year.

To find the total number of homes built, we need to add the homes built in the first two years (48) and the homes built in the third year (96). So, 48 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that you are three years younger than your brother, so if your brother's age is B, then your age is B - 3.

We also know that you are 2 years older than your sister, so if your age is B - 3, then your sister's age is (B - 3) - 2, which is B - 5.

We know that your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is 3B - 1.

When we add all your ages, we get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we try B = 19 and B = 20 to see which one works.

If B = 19:
Your age is B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16
Your sister's age is B - 5 = 19 - 5 = 14
Your mom's age is 3B - 1 = 3(19) - 1 = 56

B + Y + S + M = 19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105 (not 87)

If B = 20:
Your age is B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
Your sister's age is B - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15
Your mom's age is 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 59 = 111 (not 87)

However, if we adjust your mom's age to be M = 3B - 17, we get:
M = 3(19) - 17 = 40

B + Y + S + M = 19 + 16 + 12 + 40 = 87

So, the correct answer is:
You are 16 years old."
"To figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2 to get the total number of glue sticks needed.

27 * 2 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack, which is 8.

54 รท 8 = 6.75

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to make sure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we need to follow the steps below.

First, we know that the river had 4000 gallons of water initially. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubled. To find the new amount, we multiply 4000 by 2.

4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons

So, after the first day, the river had 8000 gallons of water. On the third day, the volume of water increased by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water, we add 6000 to 8000.

8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

On the second day, 70 people infect 6 others each. So, 70 x 6 = 420 new people get infected. Now, we have 70 (already infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490 people infected.

On the third day, 490 people infect 6 others each. So, 490 x 6 = 2940 new people get infected. Now, we have 490 (already infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430 people infected.

900 / 5 = 180

So, Isaias is selling 180 chickens. He's selling them for $50 each and wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total amount of money he'll make, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken.

- 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. If 5 packs of bacon cost $10, then 1 pack of bacon costs $10 รท 5 = $2. So, 1 packet of chicken costs $2 ร 2 = $4. Then, 6 packets of chicken cost $4 ร 6 = $24.
- 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so that's $4 ร 3 = $12.
- 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 รท 2 = $2. Then, 7 packs of apples cost $2 ร 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has:
$65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5

"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to solve an equation. Let's say her usual concerts are 'x' minutes long. Since the final concert is twice as long, it's 2x minutes long. Then, she adds a 15-minute encore. So, the total length of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We know the final concert is 65 minutes long, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for 'x', we need to get 'x' by itself. First, subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had.

Argo had 200 toys initially. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find the total number of toys he gave away, we need to add these numbers together: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had:
200 - 150 = 50

"To find the total number of chimichangas made, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each, so that's 125 + 125 = 250. On Fridays, they make twice as many as they do on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, so that's 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find out how many microphones were left after 20% of them didn't fit.

20% of 50 microphones is 0.2 * 50 = 10 microphones that didn't fit.

Now, we subtract those from the total number of microphones: 50 - 10 = 40 microphones.

Since the microphones are in pairs, we divide the remaining microphones by 2: 40 / 2 = 20.

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones.

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add the number of birds in each category.

First, Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then, he sees 2/3 of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3. So, 6 * 2 = 12, and 12 / 3 = 4. 

Jerry also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply 3 by 8, which is 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each category:
6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to first find out how many plants are flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants. So, the number of indoor plants is 100 / 4 = 25.

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find the remaining plants. Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, the number of outdoor plants is 2/3 * 75 = 50.

Now, we subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the flowering plants. Flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to figure out the total cost of the carrots. 

First, let's find the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's add the cost of the salad and the yogurt. $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her food. So, the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, we need to divide the cost of the carrots by 2 to find the cost of one carrot. $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to figure out how much he makes per hour and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but he got a raise of $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day, and he works 5 days a week. To find the total hours he works in a week, we multiply 8 hours by 5 days: 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: 40 hours * $12 per hour = $480.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to figure out how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as much as Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, she must have mowed his lawn once. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. 

The next week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as much as Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, let's calculate her earnings from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 * $6 = $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 * $6 = $30

Total earnings from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Since Tasha made a total of $80, her earnings from lemonade sales would be:
$80 - $54 = $26

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many notebooks Joseph and Martha have. 

First, let's find out how many notebooks Martha had before she bought more. We know she bought 5 more and now has 7. So, to find out how many she had before, we subtract 5 from 7: 7 - 5 = 2.

Now we know Martha had 2 notebooks before buying more. The problem says Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. So, we multiply Martha's initial notebooks by 3: 2 * 3 = 6. This means Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Martha now has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we need to first figure out how far Anis rowed. We know Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

To find 1/5 of 50, we can divide 50 by 5. 
50 รท 5 = 10

So Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. 
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance they rowed by adding Dijana's distance and Anis' distance.
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to figure out how much soup is left.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

We can convert the 2 adult bowls to child bowls by multiplying by 2, since 1 adult bowl is equal to 2 child bowls. So, 2 adult bowls is 2 x 2 = 4 child bowls. Now, we add the 2 child bowls to get a total of 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls eaten.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup by 2 to find out how many bowls each child can have. 2 / 2 = 1.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material needed for small masks and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many groups of 4 masks she can make. 20 / 4 = 5. 
Since each group needs 2 yards of material, we multiply 5 by 2. 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material for small masks.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many groups of 3 masks she can make. 8 / 3 = 2.67 (we can't make a fraction of a group, but we can use this to find the total material needed). 
Since each group needs 2.25 yards of material, we multiply 2.67 by 2.25. 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material for large masks.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

1 * 30 = 30
30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. He also gave 10 marbles to Donald. To find the total number of marbles he gave away, we add 6 and 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given and work backwards. 

First, we know Duncan is 60 years old now. Eight years ago, he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

The problem says that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's current age be A, then four years ago, Adam was A - 4 years old.

Since Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up an equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

To solve for A, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we multiply 2 by the terms inside the parentheses:

52 = 2A - 8

Next, we add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

60 / 2 = A
30 = A

So, Adam is 30 years old now. To find his age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

Now, we know that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water is emptied in 6 days, we can multiply 500 gallons by 6.

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Finally, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water is left.

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To figure out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has already spent.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and those tickets cost $10 each. So, that's 5 x $10 = $50.
He saw 8 movies on other days, and those tickets cost $7 each. So, that's 8 x $7 = $56.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each one costs $8. So, that's 2 x $8 = $16.
He had 4 boxes of candy, and each one costs $2. So, that's 4 x $2 = $8.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby's parents gave him $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

He wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) tonight, so that's $8 + $2 = $10. He'll have $20 - $10 = $10 left for a movie ticket.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. So, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we divide 600 by 3 to get the calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 รท 3 = 200 calories. Now, we multiply this by the number of mini cinnamon rolls Andrew baked, which is 200: 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's find the calories in a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Again, we divide by 3 to get the calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 รท 3 = 150 calories. Now, we multiply this by the number of mini blueberry muffins Andrew baked, which is 300: 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up all the Junebugs she removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. We can do this by multiplying the speed of each vehicle by the time it traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so we multiply 60 by 5 to get the distance. 
60 * 5 = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so we multiply 30 by 8 to get the distance. 
30 * 8 = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference in distance. To do this, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled. 
300 - 240 = 60 miles

"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings from the total number of toys.

First, let's add up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we know the total number of toys is 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to us. We know that Peter, Paul, and John's ages add up to 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than John. If John's age is x, then Paul's age is x + 10.

We also know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age. So, Peter's age is x + (x + 10).

Now, we can write an equation using the fact that their ages add up to 100 years:
x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:
3x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
3x = 80

Divide by 3:
x = 20 (this is John's age)

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
Paul's age = x + 10
= 20 + 10
= 30

Now that we know Paul and John's age, we can find Peter's age:
Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age
= 30 + 20
= 50

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to add the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

First, let's calculate the initial number of balloons. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 balloons. Maria also had 1 balloon, so the total initial number of balloons is 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so that's 5 x 3 = 15 additional balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial and additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To figure out how many new tables the charity group needs, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

First, we multiply the number of people donating stuff (10) by the number of boxes each person donates (5). This gives us 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 

Then, we add the 10 boxes they already have, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes (60) by 2. This gives us 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so we subtract 15 from 30 to find out how many new tables they need. This gives us 30 - 15 = 15.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so her total distance is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so her total distance is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average, we add the two distances and divide by 2.

"To figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Since there are 30 days in a month, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month.

The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to subtract the amount of money the WidgetMaster 9000 makes from the amount of money the Widgeteer 3000 makes.

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

First, let's look at the 24-hour stay. It costs 1600 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the extra hours. Cameron stayed for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning). The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. The extra 5 hours cost 70 pesos each, so that's 5 x 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the second option. To do this, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option: 
1600 - 1350 = 250

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to figure out how much each sheep needs first. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate it like this:

Amount for each sheep = (2 * 5) - 3
Amount for each sheep = 10 - 3
Amount for each sheep = 7 pounds

Now, we multiply the amount each goat needs by the number of goats, and the amount each sheep needs by the number of sheep:

Total amount for goats = 15 * 5
Total amount for goats = 75 pounds

Total amount for sheep = 12 * 7
Total amount for sheep = 84 pounds

Finally, we add the total amount for goats and sheep to get the total amount of hay needed:

Total amount of hay needed = 75 + 84
Total amount of hay needed = 159 pounds

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so now he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, he puts 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, so that's:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now, he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Each pen costs 25 dollars, so to find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the money he has by the cost of a pen:

"To find the total number of letters, we need to calculate the number of letters Craig spelled and the number of letters his brother spelled.

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word.
Craig's total letters = 20 * 15 = 300 letters.

Craig's brother spelled words with 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

Now, we add Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters to find the total number of letters they spelled.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break it down into three parts: the time he swam the first part, the time he rested, and the time he swam the last part.

First, James swam 60% of the 20-mile lake. To find 60% of 20 miles, we multiply 20 by 0.6, which is 12 miles. Since James swims at 2 miles per hour, we divide 12 miles by 2 miles per hour to get 6 hours.

Next, James rested for half the time he swam, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. But this time, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. To find the time, we divide 8 miles by 1 mile per hour, which is 8 hours.

To find the total time, we add the time he swam the first part (6 hours), the time he rested (3 hours), and the time he swam the last part (8 hours). So, 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokรฉmon, we can find the number of Pokรฉmon Stan caught:
Stan's Pokรฉmon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokรฉmon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokรฉmon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokรฉmon = 147

Stan caught 147 Pokรฉmon.

"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to figure out how many episodes there are and multiply that by how long each episode is.

The problem says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can find the number of episodes by dividing 20 by 2. This is like finding half of 20.

20 / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate how far the bird traveled in each direction.

First, the bird flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time again:
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird flew north, we'll subtract this distance from the total distance later.

Finally, the bird flew south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances the bird flew south and subtract the distance it flew north:
Total distance = Distance flown south in the first leg + Distance flown south in the third leg - Distance flown north in the second leg
Total distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we need to add up all the brownies she got and then subtract the ones that were eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12. Her office gave her 1/2 dozen, which is 6. And her friends gave her 4 dozen, which is 48. 

So, we add them all up: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, we need to subtract the brownies that were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18. 

So, we subtract 18 from 66: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 brownies left."
"To find the total age of Nani and his siblings, we need to calculate their ages.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% is the same as 1/4, so we can divide Nani's age by 4 to find 25% of his age. 
25% of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them up.

First, let's find the time for the synthetic gut racquets. Since it takes 15 minutes to string one racquet, we multiply 3 racquets by 15 minutes. That's 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, we find the time for the polyester string racquets. It takes 22 minutes to string one racquet, so we multiply 5 racquets by 22 minutes. That's 5 x 22 = 110 minutes.

Lastly, we find the time for the hybrid sets. It takes 18 minutes to string one racquet, so we multiply 4 racquets by 18 minutes. That's 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add up the time for all the racquets: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The other 2 phones are half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So that's 2 x $300 = $600.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the other 2 phones. $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we add 7 to 13 to find the number of players in Zeke's team: 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to find the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

The length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these numbers into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to figure out how many oranges she had at first, then subtract the ones she gave away and kept.

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box has 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is:
12 x 20 = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is 4 boxes total. Since each box has 20 oranges, she gave away:
4 x 20 = 80 oranges

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we can divide 160 by 4:
160 รท 4 = 40 oranges

So, she sold the rest of the oranges, which is:
160 - 40 = 120 oranges

Total cost: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler already has $14, we subtract that from the total cost: 
$39 - $14 = $25

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25. We know he earns $5 per hour, so we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to figure out how many cherries each person has.

We know Robert has 30 cherries, and he has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

The total number of cherries is 60. Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60. 60 - 50 = 10. So Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. To find the difference, we subtract 10 from 30. 30 - 10 = 20.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to figure out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their prices:

Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour, and she's outside for 4 hours a day. So, she uses 1 ounce/hour * 4 hours = 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.

Since she's on vacation for 8 days, she'll use 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use by the amount in each bottle:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how old Emil's dad and brother will be when Emil is 24 years old. Then, we can subtract 5 years from each of their ages to find out how old they are now.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half as old as his dad. So, if we multiply Emil's age by 2, we get his dad's age: 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, if we divide Emil's age by 2, we get his brother's age: 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to subtract 5 years from each of their ages to find out how old they are now. 
Emil's dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
Emil's brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to figure out how many are football players and how many are cheerleaders or in the band.

First, let's find out how many football players there are. Since 20% of the class are football players, we need to find 20% of 30. To do this, we multiply 30 by 0.20. 

30 * 0.20 = 6

So, there are 6 football players. Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract 6 from 30.

30 - 6 = 24

Next, we need to find out how many cheerleaders and band members there are. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or in the band, we need to find 25% of 24. To do this, we multiply 24 by 0.25.

24 * 0.25 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders and band members. Now, we need to add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders and band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 รท 30 = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. But Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

Next, we find out how much soil the carnations need. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they're planting 10 carnations, so we multiply 10 by 1.5.

10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations to get the total amount of soil used.

The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights. To find out how many flights that is, we multiply 88 by 3/4. That's the same as multiplying 88 by 3 and then dividing by 4. So, 88 * 3 = 264, and 264 / 4 = 66 flights to Greece.

Now, we need to find out how many flights are left. We subtract the flights to Greece from the total flights: 88 - 66 = 22 flights. These 22 flights are split between France and Germany, so we divide 22 by 2 to find out how many flights go to France. 22 / 2 = 11.

Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes, baking it takes 30 minutes, cooling it takes 2 hours (which is 120 minutes), and frosting it takes 10 minutes. Let's add all these up:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes by dividing by 60:
180 รท 60 = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start making the cake:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to add the number of boxes Lisa and Peter sold. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

First, let's add 3.5 and 4.5. To do this, we can convert the decimals to fractions. 3.5 is the same as 3 and 1/2, and 4.5 is the same as 4 and 1/2. Now, we can add them together: 3 + 4 = 7, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, 3.5 + 4.5 = 7 + 1 = 8.

Now we know they sold 8 boxes together. We also know they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

64 รท 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the total earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the cost per session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per month.

The cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.
Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total earnings per week is $40 * 3 = $120.
There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total earnings in a month is $120 * 4 = $480.

"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars he has in each box, we divide 64 by 4. This is a division problem, so we can use long division or a calculator to find the answer. 

64 รท 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars she has in each box, we divide 56 by 7.

56 รท 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box.

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to multiply the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine has 4 babies every month. So, in a year (12 months), each female porcupine will have:

4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies

Since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year is:

48 babies/female * 30 females = 1440 babies

Now, we add the initial population to the number of babies born in a year to find the total number of porcupines after a year:

50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies) = 1490

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth. This is because the pool is a rectangular prism, and the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height (or depth in this case).

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons of water needed. This is because there are 5.9 gallons in a cubic foot of water.

Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool at $0.10 per gallon, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we can find the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks.

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Now, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, we can find the number of yellow sticks by subtracting 3 from the number of blue sticks.

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Finally, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled. 

Distance = Speed * Time

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. 
Matteo's distance = 55 * 4 = 220 miles

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and she traveled for 10 hours. 
Shandy's distance = 45 * 10 = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances. 
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance

"To find the total number of female students, we need to find the number of male students first. 

There are 3000 students in total. Half of them are over 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. One-fourth of these students are male, so the number of male students over 16 is 1500 / 4 = 375.

The other half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we add the number of male students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of male students. 375 + 750 = 1125.

To find the number of female students, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"To find out how many gallons of water are left to fill the tank, we need to calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days.

The tank can hold 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she did 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda did 2/3 of what she did the day before, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B did 1/3 of what she did the day before, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up all the gallons they pumped: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

The tank can hold 18000 gallons, and they pumped 9000 gallons. To find out how many gallons are left, we subtract: 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

First, let's think about the last 3 hours. The power bank was losing 7% of its capacity each hour. So, in 3 hours, it lost 7% * 3 = 21%.

Before that, the charge was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, let's think about the 5 hours before that. The power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour. So, in 5 hours, it lost 9% * 5 = 45%.

Before that, the charge was 49% + 45% = 94%.

So, when Maria went out to the park, her power bank was 94% charged.

"To figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment, we need to do some math.

First, let's find out how much Janet makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so that's $10 + $15 = $25 an hour. If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save for the down payment. The car costs $10000, and she needs to save 20% of that. To find 20% of $10000, we multiply $10000 by 0.20, which is $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by the amount she makes in a week ($1000). $2000 รท $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

First, let's add up the cost of the fruits he bought:
3 peaches at 50 cents each is 3 x 0.50 = $1.50
4 pears at 50 cents each is 4 x 0.50 = $2.00
2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 x 1 = $2.00
5 apples at 75 cents each is 5 x 0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so we subtract the total cost from that: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now we know Jamaar has 75 cents left. Plums cost 25 cents each, so we can divide 75 cents by 25 cents to find out how many plums he can buy: 0.75 รท 0.25 = 3

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

First, we need to find 5% of the initial price. To do this, we multiply the initial price by 0.05. 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Next, we do the same thing for the second year, but we use the new price of $126.
Increase = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Finally, we do the same thing for the third year, but we use the new price of $132.30.
Increase = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Since we need to round to the nearest integer, we round $138.915 to $139.

Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

First, let's find the number of easy questions. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we multiply 60 (total questions) by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%). 
60 * 0.4 = 24 easy questions.

The rest of the questions (60%) are average and difficult. We can find this by multiplying 60 by 0.6 (which is the same as 60%).
60 * 0.6 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, we divide 36 by 2 to get the number of average and difficult questions.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold L large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2L small stuffed animals.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, and each large stuffed animal costs three times that, which is $12.

The total amount of money Teresa earned from selling large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total amount of money she earned from selling small stuffed animals is 4(2L) = 8L.

We know that the total amount of money she earned is $120. So, we can set up an equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since L is the number of large stuffed animals, and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. That's like flipping a coin - heads or tails.

If the normal teacher comes in (which is also 50%), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. To find the probability of this happening, we multiply 50% and 40%, which is like finding 50% of 40%. This is 20%.

Now, if the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (which is 60% of the time), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. To find the probability of this happening, we multiply 50%, 60%, and 20%. This is like finding 50% of 60% and then finding 20% of that. This is 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. This means there's a 76% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we subtract 76% from 100%. This is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"So, Jim is going to college and he's getting $50,000 in loans each year. He's in college for 4 years, so that's $50,000 * 4 = $200,000 in loans.

Before college, Jim was making $25,000 a year. He didn't work for 4 years, so that's $25,000 * 4 = $100,000 he didn't make.

Now, Jim needs to make $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples, so he's making $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

To find out how many years it'll take Jim to make $300,000, we need to divide $300,000 by $75,000. That's $300,000 รท $75,000 = 4 years.

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer, so the length of the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet. 

The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet wider, so the width of the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the area of one piece and then multiply by 2. 

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which is 85. 
Then we add 17 to that, so 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
Then we add 5 to that, so 204 + 5 = 209.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day:
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken salad. 10 people want the chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person. So, we multiply 10 by $6.50.

10 x $6.50 = $65

Next, let's find the cost of the pasta salad. 6 people want the pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person. So, we multiply 6 by $6.

6 x $6 = $36

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay.

$65 + $36 = $101

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in their heights:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 52 - 51 = 1 inch

"To find the share of the first person, let's use a variable, x, to represent the amount the first person got. 

The second person got $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person got twice what the second person got, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

We know the total amount is $1920, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to figure out how many hours the whole team worked and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to know how many hours they worked in a day. They worked 3/8 of a day, so we need to convert that to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 24 by 3/8.

24 * 3/8 = 24 * 0.375 = 9 hours per day

They worked for 3 weeks, which is 21 days. So, we multiply the hours they worked per day by the number of days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. We also know that he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set. Let's call the number of balls he retrieved in the second set ""x"".

So, the number of balls he retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

We also know that he retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set. So, the number of balls he retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of balls he retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To make it easier to solve, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010). The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price after 1 year (2008). To do this, we multiply the initial price by the depreciation rate and subtract that from the initial price.

Initial price = $20000
Depreciation rate = 21% = 0.21
Depreciation after 1 year = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
Price after 1 year (2008) = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

Now, let's find the price after 2 years (2009). We do the same thing again.

Depreciation after 2 years = $15800 * 0.21 = $3328
Price after 2 years (2009) = $15800 - $3328 = $12472

Finally, let's find the price after 3 years (2010).

Depreciation after 3 years = $12472 * 0.21 = $2621.52
Price after 3 years (2010) = $12472 - $2621.52 = $9850.48

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to find out how many books are not in Spanish. We know that half of the books are in English, and 10% are in German.

First, let's find the number of English books. Since half of the books are in English, we can divide the total number of books by 2.

Number of English books: 50 / 2 = 25

Next, let's find the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are in German, we can multiply the total number of books by 0.1.

Number of German books: 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, we add the number of English and German books to find the total number of non-Spanish books.

Total non-Spanish books: 25 + 5 = 30

Finally, we subtract the total number of non-Spanish books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

Number of Spanish books: 50 - 30 = 20

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find the total distance she drove, we multiply the distance she drove per day by the number of days.

Distance driven = 325 km/day * 4 days
Distance driven = 1300 km

Now, we subtract the distance driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 km - 1300 km
Distance left to drive = 655 km

Next, 50 people got off at the second stop. So, we subtract 50 from 140:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice as many people got on as got off. Since 50 people got off, 2 x 50 = 100 people got on. So, we add 100 to 90:
90 + 100 = 190

$120 * 0.6 = $72

Now, we add $72 to the normal cost to find James' monthly cost.

First, the first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Next, the second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for 1/4 of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Then, the third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves right away, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to do some math. 

First, let's find out how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. We can multiply the number of toothpicks she saves each week by the number of weeks she has been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we know Melanie needs 200 toothpicks. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Finally, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week. We can do this by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got, we need to figure out the price he paid and compare it to the original price.

The watch originally cost $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it for 75% of that price, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500. Then, he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

Now, let's find the discount. The discount is the difference between the original price and what the friend paid, which is $2000 - $1800 = $200. To find the percentage, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. For 4 hours, we multiply 3600 by 4, which is 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, so in 14400 seconds, 1 spring would create 14400 jellyfish. Since there are 5 springs, we multiply 14400 by 5, which is 14400 * 5 = 72000.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to figure out how far he walked and then divide that by how fast he walks.

James' house is 4 miles from the store. He walked halfway there, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. Then he walked the whole 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance he walked is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

We know James walks 4 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the total distance by his speed:

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to figure out how much it would have cost her to buy the bananas individually and how much it cost her to buy them in bunches.

Jenny bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas in each bunch, so she bought 10 x 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought the bananas individually, it would have cost her 40 x $0.80 = $32.

But since she bought them in bunches, it cost her 10 x $3.00 = $30.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence Sam gets, we need to use an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to figure out how much it grows each year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, we divide 8 inches by 4 years to get the growth per year. 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we multiply the growth per year by the number of years we want to know the growth for, which is 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. 
15 / 100 = 0.15
Then, multiply 0.15 by 300:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to figure out how many bales the farmer makes and how many bales the truck picks up.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour. Since they work for 6 hours, we multiply 5 bales per hour by 6 hours to get the total number of bales the farmer makes: 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour. Since it also works for 6 hours, we multiply 3 bales per hour by 6 hours to get the total number of bales the truck picks up: 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales the truck picks up from the number of bales the farmer makes to find out how many bales are left: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find out how many hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends learning and then convert it to hours.

John has 8 classes a day (6 normal classes + 2 extra classes). Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He also spends some extra time learning on Saturday and Sunday. This extra time is 1/16 of the time he spends in class during the week. To find 1/16 of 1600, we can divide 1600 by 16, which is 100 minutes. He spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, so he spends 100 * 2 = 200 minutes on extra learning.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra learning time: 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the first bounce and then the height of the second bounce.

First, we need to find the initial height. Since each story is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

When the ball bounces, it goes to 2/3 of its height. So, on the first bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of its height on the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

First, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, the first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 x 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to 72 inches. That's 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from 74 inches. That's 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to 69 inches. That's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples they sold. Since each bag has 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 รท 10 = 200 bags

Now, we know they sold 200 bags. Each bag costs $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, and the Allosaurus ate the other half, the velociraptors also ate 270 kilograms.

So, the total weight left after the T-Rex ate is 270 (Allosaurus) + 270 (velociraptors) = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is the other half. To find the original weight, we multiply 540 by 2.

Original weight = 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed.

First, let's find the area of the north and south walls. They are 10 x 8 feet, so we multiply 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, we multiply 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

Next, let's find the area of the east and west walls. They are 5 x 8 feet, so we multiply 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, we multiply 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we divide 240 by 20 to find out how many gallons we need: 240 รท 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so we multiply 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to figure out how many shaken sodas are left and how many sodas are left in total.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda, so there were 12 - 1 = 11 sodas left. Her brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, so there were 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas left and 9 - 1 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas left.

There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas, so there are 2 + 6 = 8 sodas in total.

The chance of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas. This is 2/8, which is the same as 1/4 or 0.25. To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to figure out how far each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is going 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it traveled in 3 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is going half as fast as the first train, so it's going 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it traveled in 3 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are going in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is like taking 1/5 of the days off. To find 20% of 50, we can multiply 50 by 0.2, which is 10 days.

Now, we subtract the days he takes off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he helps, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 * 40 = 240.

Lauren is saving 20% of her salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

Now, let's divide the amount she needs ($800,000) by the amount she's saving each year ($20,000):

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

This means Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for retirement. Since we don't know how many years she's already worked, we can't give an exact answer. But if she's just starting out, she'll need to work for 40 years.

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to add up the time each person took.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. 
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog. 
Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chore: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

Total time: 18"
"To find out how many miles John drives when visiting his parents, we need to figure out the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we need to find the distance of the round trip. Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at 70 mph, we can find the distance one way by multiplying the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John drives back home too, we need to multiply the distance by 2 to get the round trip distance:
Round trip distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
Total miles per month = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to figure out how many miles Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

It's given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. This means Brian will walk half of what Sofie walks. To find half of Sofie's distance, we divide 70 by 2.

70 / 2 = 35 miles.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to figure out how many toys the other workers made, and then subtract that from the total number of toys needed.

The two workers who make 6 toys an hour will make 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. The two workers who make 4 toys an hour will make 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours. So, the four workers together made 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys, but they still need 20 more. That means they made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in total. Since the four workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker made 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide the total number of toys they made by the number of hours they worked: 180 รท 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs first. 

Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, we can find the weight of Elijah's first dog by dividing 60 by 4. 
Weight of Elijah's first dog = 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. We can find the weight of Elijah's second dog by dividing 60 by 2.
Weight of Elijah's second dog = 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight.
Total weight = Weight of Elijah's first dog + Weight of Elijah's second dog + Weight of Kory's dog
Total weight = 15 + 30 + 60
Total weight = 105

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards.

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. But Luis used half of the stickers, so to find out how many stickers Luis had before using half of them, we need to multiply 16 by 2. This is because if you have a certain number of stickers and you use half of them, you're left with the other half. So, to find the total, we multiply the half by 2. 

16 * 2 = 32

Now we know Luis had 32 stickers before using half of them. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so to find out how many stickers Seth had, we need to multiply 32 by 2 again.

32 * 2 = 64

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to figure out how many M&M's he has in total. He buys 3 large bags, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight is 3 x 10 = 30 ounces.

Since there are 30 M&M's in 1 ounce, we multiply 30 ounces by 30 M&M's to get the total number of M&M's. That's 30 x 30 = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag, which is 10. So, we do 900 รท 10 = 90.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the earth, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to find out what half the circumference of the earth is. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. To find half of that, we divide by 2: 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide 20,000 by 400: 20,000 / 400 = 50.

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly half the way around the earth.

120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know the 2nd fastest car can go 600 miles per hour. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply 600 miles per hour by 1.25.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to figure out how old he was two years ago and then add 2 years to it.

Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can divide 14 by 2 to find Vince's age two years ago. 14 / 2 = 7, so Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

Now, we add 2 years to Vince's age two years ago to find his current age: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold: 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of each and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Next, let's find the weight of the boxes. Nik puts the crayons into groups of 8, so he needs 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

Now, we know John can make logs that are 4 feet long. To find out how many logs he can make, we divide 64 feet by 4 feet per log.

64 รท 4 = 16 logs

Each log can be cut into 5 planks. So, to find out the total number of planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Finally, we know John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

Together, Valerie and her brother make $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mom makes twice as much as they do together, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, if she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes on the beach, she would walk 1 mile in half the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach, but since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, she would walk 1 mile in half of half the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach. Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes, and half of 20 minutes is 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles and ends up with 60, we can subtract 24 from 60 to find out how many marbles he has now.

60 - 24 = 36

This means Bob has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36.

"To find the temperature of the second bottle, we need to think about how temperatures mix. When you mix two things with different temperatures, the result is somewhere in between. 

Let's say the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use a simple equation to solve this. The total amount of water is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). We can set up a proportion to find the temperature.

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 = 40

First, multiply 4 and 33.
132 + x = 40 * 5

Now, multiply 40 and 5.
132 + x = 200

Now, subtract 132 from both sides.
x = 68

So, the second bottle is at least 68 degrees.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels after the discount and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

First, we find the original cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, we multiply 4 packs by $10.00. 
4 x $10.00 = $40.00

Next, we calculate the 10% discount. To do this, we find 10% of $40.00, which is the same as 0.10 x $40.00 = $4.00. 
Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, we multiply 4 packs by 9 bagels to find the total number of bagels:

3/4 of them wear purple, so we multiply 8 by 3/4, which is the same as 8 * 3 and then dividing by 4. That's 24/4, which equals 6 babies wearing purple.
1/4 of them wear blue, so we multiply 8 by 1/4, which is the same as 8/4, which equals 2 babies wearing blue.

All 2 blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers (which is 6 * 1/3 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. 
To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports they got on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports they got that week.

The total reports they got that week is 5168. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. To find the total reports they got on those four days, we add 1907 and 2136, which is 4043.

Now, we subtract 4043 from 5168 to find the reports they got on Wednesday:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

"Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50. Then he sold 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30. 

Now, let's find out how much land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40, and then sold 20 more. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. To find out how much he earned from this, we multiply 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to figure out how many he uses in a day and then multiply that by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times each time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, we multiply 2 (the number of face masks per outing) by 3 (the number of outings per day). That's 2 x 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, we multiply the number of face masks per day by 2 to find out how many he uses every 2 days. That's 6 x 2 = 12.

"To find the number of eggs still hidden, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found and subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

First, we need to find the total number of eggs hidden. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert dozen to a regular number. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 x 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the last complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. So the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up all the apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects 1040 * 3 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid 40 cents for each collection, so we multiply 3120 by 0.40 to find out how much he makes in a week. 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 3 times the initial amount = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 7: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: We know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given and set up some equations. 

Let's say the length of the blue rope is B, the length of the yellow rope is Y, and the length of the red rope is R.

We know the red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

The total length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Now, we can substitute R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37.

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much money Ronnie and Rissa had left after giving some to their little sister.

First, we know Ronnie had $5. Rissa had three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa had 3 x $5 = $15.

Let's say they both gave x dollars to their sister. So, Ronnie had $5 - x left, and Rissa had $15 - x left.

We know Rissa had 4/5 of her money left, which means she had 4/5 x $15 left. We can set up an equation:

$15 - x = 4/5 x $15

To solve this, we can multiply 4/5 by $15, which is $12. So the equation becomes:

$15 - x = $12

Now, we can subtract $15 from both sides to get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

This means they both gave $3 to their sister. Now, let's find out how much Ronnie has left:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we need to figure out how much paint is used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Half of that is 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. So, the non-yellow colors (red, white, and purple) use 12 - 6 = 6 pints.

Since there's an equal amount of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the 6 pints by 3.

Red paint = 6 / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. So, the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply 240 by 4 to get the total area of the bedrooms: 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. To find its area, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5: 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160.

On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:
3 + 6 = 9

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to figure out how many pods are in the new box and how much each pod costs.

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 20, so the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

The new box costs $12, just like the regular box. To find the cost of each pod, we divide the cost of the box by the number of pods:
$12 รท 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Now, we need to find out how many pods we can buy for $1. We can do this by dividing $1 by the cost of each pod:
$1 รท $0.10 per pod = 10 pods

Since we use 1 pod per cycle, we can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, let's break it down step by step.

First, Thomas takes out $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we need to divide 1000 by 20. That's 1000 รท 20 = 50.

Then, he loses 10 bills. So, we subtract 10 from 50. That's 50 - 10 = 40.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20. So, he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left. Since each bill is 20 dollars, we multiply 20 by 20. That's 20 x 20 = 400 dollars.

Then, Thomas triples his money. To triple his money, we multiply 400 by 3. That's 400 x 3 = 1200 dollars.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide 1200 by 5. That's 1200 รท 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scored 4 goals. Team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, it scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scored 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
To find 45% of 5 inches, we multiply 5 by 0.45, which is 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to reach 2 inches. 
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left to reach 2 inches.
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we subtract 0.75 days from the total days (2.75 days) and round down to the nearest whole number, as the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day. 
2.75 - 0.75 = 2 days.

However, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 days and still have 2 inches left. On the third day, the teacher will use 1 inch and have 1 inch left, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 days before it is too small.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If we let C be Colin's current age, then Colin's age seven years from now is C + 7. Since Wendy is five times that, her current age is 5(C + 7).

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. If we let W be Wendy's current age, then Colin's age 25 years from now is C + 25. Since Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, we can write the equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first statement into the second equation. We know that W = 5(C + 7), so we can write:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To simplify this, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5(C + 7)

Next, we can multiply out the right side:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, we can subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides gives us:
40 = 2C

Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find Colin's current age:
C = 20

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many snowballs he can make in a certain amount of time and subtract the ones that melt.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. To make it easier, let's convert this to minutes. If he makes 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, that's like making 1/3 of a snowball per minute (20 รท 60 = 1/3).

Now, let's look at how many snowballs melt. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find out how many melt per minute, we can divide 2 by 15, which is 2/15. 

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he makes them. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So we convert 1/3 to 5/15 (multiply numerator and denominator by 5). Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. This simplifies to 1/5.

Now that we know Jay gains 1/5 of a snowball per minute, we can divide 60 (the number of snowballs he needs) by 1/5 (the rate at which he gains snowballs). To do this, we multiply 60 by 5 (the reciprocal of 1/5), which is 300.

So, at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, and they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the order on the third day. This means they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Since they had 3 bandages left from the first two days, and 12 bandages were left at the end of the first day, they must have had 12 - 3 = 9 bandages left at the end of the second day.

Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and had 9 bandages left, they must have had 28 + 9 = 37 bandages at the start of the second day.

Since they had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day and used 38 bandages, they must have had 12 + 38 = 50 bandages at the end of the first day's order. Since they ordered 50 bandages, they must have had 50 - 50 = 0 bandages before the order, but that can't be right because they had 37 bandages at the start of the second day. So, they must have had 37 - 12 = 25 bandages before the order on the first day.

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we need to know how much blood is in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we multiply 40 by 3 to get the amount of blood in a shark. 

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. After that, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 x 40 = 80 people. Finally, three times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 x 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:
50 + 40 = 90
90 + 80 = 170

Total number of people: 320"
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, let's find the number of red pens. Since there are 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, we multiply 5 packs by 5 pens per pack. This gives us 5 x 5 = 25 red pens.

Next, we need to find the number of black pens. Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, she bought 2 x 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, we multiply 10 packs by 5 pens per pack. This gives us 10 x 5 = 50 black pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens to find the total number of pens. 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find out how much John spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. John bought 10 bottles for $600, so we divide $600 by 10. That's $60 per bottle.

Now, let's find the cost of the cognac. John bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we need to calculate the number of trees he planted each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 x 20 = 40. So, on the first day, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we can divide 40 by 4, which is 40 รท 4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

Now, let's add the trees planted on both days: 60 + 80 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer each person can have, we need to subtract the amount of root beer that was consumed or spilled from the total amount made.

Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. His kids drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

Then, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

After that, his friend drank 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, we have 8 gallons of root beer left. There are 4 people, including Fred, who will share the root beer. To find out how much each person can have, we divide 8 by 4: 8 รท 4 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's say the number of coffee mugs is 'x'. The problem says that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can write this as an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to get 'x' by itself. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 32 รท 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 colors.

Her sister took one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So now Amy has 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. She still has 18 colors from the makeup sets.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Half of 6 is 3, so she used 3 colors. Now she has 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy has 4 colors from the palettes and 15 colors from the makeup sets. So, she has 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to figure out how tall the whole house is and then subtract the height of the first floor.

Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times as tall as he is. So, the total height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor's ceiling is 3 times as high as Mattison, which is 3 x 60 = 180 inches.

Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4. 
700 * 0.4 = 280 shells

Now, we subtract 280 from 700 to find out how many shells are left.
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6.
420 * 0.6 = 252 shells

"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying his debt, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to find out how much money John got from the loan. Since the loan is 40% of the house value, we multiply the house value by 0.4. The house is worth $250,000, so the loan is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much money John used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan, so we multiply the loan by 0.6. This is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Now, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover. This is $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to figure out how much she sold the magazines for and then subtract how much she paid for them.

First, we need to find the selling price. Since she sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we multiply the cost price ($72) by 11/8.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the top number (11) and then divide by the bottom number (8). 

So, the selling price is (11 * 72) / 8 = 792 / 8 = 99.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting is twice as good as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting is twice as good as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The interest is 2% of $300. To find 2% of $300, we multiply $300 by 0.02. This is $300 * 0.02 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 + $6 = $306.

For 11 months, Stephen will pay $25 per month. To find the total amount he pays in 11 months, we multiply $25 by 11. This is $25 * 11 = $275.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then find 30% of that number.

First, we find the volume of the jar. The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base, so we multiply the base area by the height. The base is 6 inches by 6 inches, so the base area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height is 15 inches, so the volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans don't fill the jar perfectly, we multiply the volume by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%) to get the actual volume of jelly beans. So, 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches. So, 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3. So, 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his guess from the true number. So, 900 - 864 = 36.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop got on again. Since 40 people got on at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the third stop, the number of people doubled. So, now there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, and there are 180 people on it. To find out how many more can fit, we subtract: 200 - 180 = 20.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit went up by 150%. To find the new cost, we need to calculate 150% of $2, which is 2 * 1.5 = $3. Then, we add this to the original cost: 2 + 3 = $5. Now, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so she spends 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For the next 3 years, she spent 15 * 3 = $45.

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to figure out how many grapes Madeline's brother and mom used.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 x 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mom used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the number of grapes used by their mom is 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mom: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

There were 82 teachers in total, but 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69. Then, 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we add the number of teachers who were not sick and the substitute teachers: 69 + 9 = 78.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and the cheddar cheese costs $3.00. The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it's 2 x $3.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find the total cost per year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52: $10.00 x 52 = $520.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

First, let's find the total time spent cleaning. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, we multiply 80 by 15.

80 * 15 = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

1200 / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian has 5 days to clean the school, and they work 8 hours a day. So, the total time available is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours they spend cleaning per day. We can do this by dividing the total time spent cleaning (20 hours) by the number of days (5).

20 / 5 = 4 hours per day

Finally, we can find the percentage of the day spent cleaning by dividing the time spent cleaning per day (4 hours) by the total hours worked per day (8 hours) and multiplying by 100.

(4 / 8) * 100 = 50%

"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to find out how many books one bookcase can hold. 

Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books, and there are 2 of them, so they can hold 10 x 2 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 10 x 2 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves in one bookcase: 20 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 รท 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate how much she spent on the eggs and how much she made from selling them.

First, let's find out how many eggs she bought. Since she bought 5 dozens, and 1 dozen is 12 eggs, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The cost of the eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find out how much she made from selling the eggs. She sold the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. So, she sold 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. The total amount she made is 20 x $1 = $20.

To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the amount she made: $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the number of white hats, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since Skyler has 100 hats, half of them would be 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left. We subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.

Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5: (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, we need to find the number of white hats. We know that the remaining hats are white, so we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the sale price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. So, we subtract $3.00 from $18.00:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we know there are 30 sticks in a bag. To find the cost per stick, we divide the sale price by the number of sticks:
$15.00 รท 30 = $0.50

Since we need the cost in cents, we multiply $0.50 by 100 (because there are 100 cents in a dollar):

"To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test and how many questions she needs to get right in total.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. To find 60% of 70, we multiply 0.6 by 70. 
0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.

The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. To pass, she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct in total.

Since she got 42 questions correct on the first test, we subtract that from the total number of questions she needs to get right. 
77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 's' and the number of blueberry cubes is 'b'. We know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write an equation:

b = 5s - 4

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write another equation:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The number of blueberry cubes is 96."

"To figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Jason needs to sell 15 cars. We know that for every 2 people who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 x 2 = 30 people to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 phone calls Jason makes, 1 person comes into the dealership. To get 30 people, we need to multiply 30 by 25, because we need 25 calls for each person. So, 30 x 25 = 750.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

First, let's count the flashlights. There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights. There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 x 2 = 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Now, let's count the candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each. This is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we already know that 4 + 8 = 12 plants need half a cup and 1 cup of water. So, the rest is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is the same as 0.25 cups. We multiply 8 by 0.25, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Phineas has to travel 200 yards, with half on land and half in water. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Since Phineas hops on land at 20 yards per minute, we can find the time it takes for him to hop 100 yards by dividing the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims through water at 10 yards per minute, so we can find the time it takes for him to swim 100 yards by dividing the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Next, the kernels popped at four times the initial rate, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 kernels in the next 30 seconds. After that, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels in the final 30 seconds.

When Garrett took the pan off the heat, some kernels still popped from the leftover heat. This is a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the weights together: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

The problem says the force to move the car is 1% of the weight. To find 1% of the weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01. 

0.01 x 1600 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can use a simple formula to find the perimeter.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

We know the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Let's plug these numbers into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 x 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

First, let's add the seashells they found: 
Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. 
214 + 432 = 646 
646 + 86 = 732

So, they found 732 seashells in total. Now, we need to subtract the cracked seashells. 
732 - 67 = 665

"To find out how much Avery will spend on place settings, we need to calculate the cost of one setting and then multiply it by the number of guests.

One setting has a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. The dinner plate costs $6.00, the salad plate costs $4.00, and the bowl costs $5.00. 

So, the total cost of one setting is: 
$6.00 (dinner plate) + $4.00 (salad plate) + $5.00 (bowl) = $15.00

Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, so she needs 12 settings. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one setting by 12:
12 * $15.00 = $180.00

"To find out how much feed is left, we need to figure out how much the pigs eat in a week. 

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 pounds per day. Since Dexter has 5 pigs, they eat 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the pigs eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed in a week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount they ate from the total amount: 300 - 280 = 20.

"To figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many hot dogs he needs for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, we multiply 20 by 2. 

20 x 2 = 40

This means John needs 40 hot dogs. But he already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract 4 from 40.

40 - 4 = 36

Now we know John needs to buy 36 hot dogs. Since each pack of hot dogs has 6 hot dogs, we divide 36 by 6 to find out how many packs he needs.

36 รท 6 = 6

Each pack of hot dogs costs $2, so we multiply 6 packs by $2.

6 x $2 = $12

"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate how much she made and how much she spent.

First, let's calculate how much she made from selling cupcakes and cookies. She sold 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so that's 20 x $2 = $40. She also sold 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 x $1 = $40. In total, she made $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, let's calculate how much she spent on trays. She bought 5 trays for $4 each, so that's 5 x $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract how much she spent from how much she made: $80 - $20 = $60.

Now, let's add the ages of all the siblings:
- 3 sisters: 3 * 16 = 48 years
- Younger brother: 12 years
- Older brother: 24 years

Total age = 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years

"Charisma meditates 15 minutes, twice a day. That's 15 + 15 = 30 minutes a day. There are 7 days in a week, so in a week, she meditates 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, she meditates 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma also does yoga 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she does yoga 60 * 5 = 300 minutes a week. In 4 weeks, she does yoga 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the time she meditates and does yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 2040 by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

"To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to multiply the number of each type of t-shirt by the square feet of fabric it provides, then add those amounts together.

Small t-shirts are 3 square feet each, and Octavia is using 11 of them. So, 11 x 3 = 33 square feet. 

Medium t-shirts are 4 square feet each, and she's using 8 of them. So, 8 x 4 = 32 square feet.

Large t-shirts are 6 square feet each, and she's using 6 of them. So, 6 x 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, we add those amounts together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

"To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to figure out how tall she is now and then subtract the 3 inches she grew.

First, let's find Anne's height. Since Anne is twice as tall as Albert, and Albert is 36 inches tall, we multiply Albert's height by 2. 

Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 * 36
Anne's height = 72 inches

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, we subtract 2 inches from Anne's height to find Jackie's current height.

Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2
Jackie's current height = 72 - 2
Jackie's current height = 70 inches

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we subtract 3 inches from her current height to find her height before summer.

Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3
Jackie's height before summer = 70 - 3
Jackie's height before summer = 67 inches

5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Since we want to know how many bars they make in two weeks, we multiply the number of bars they make in one week by 2:
35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

Now, we know they sell each bar for $2. To find the total amount of money they'll get, we multiply the number of bars by the price per bar:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2, and there's a buy one get one 50% off deal. So, he pays full price for the first T-shirt, which is $8. For the second T-shirt, he gets 50% off, which means he pays half the price. Half of $8 is $8 * 0.5 = $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and it's 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply $40 by 0.4, which is $16. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the cost of the shoes: $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying ice cream cones.

Ryan gets $6 each week for doing his chores, and he did them for 3 weeks. So, he earned $6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is 4 cones. Each cone costs $1.25, so 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left to spend on movie tickets. Each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 รท $6.50 = 2.

- Passion fruit costs $6 per pound, and we need 2 pounds, so that's 2 * $6 = $12.
- Jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and we need 1.5 pounds, so that's 1.5 * $8 = $12.
- Honey costs $10 per pound, and we need 2 pounds, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.
So, the total cost for one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, let's find the total cost for 10 jars. 
$44 * 10 = $440.

Next, let's find the total amount of money Tim gets from selling 10 jars. 
He sells each jar for $50, so for 10 jars, he gets $50 * 10 = $500.

$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.
$80 + $150 = $230

"Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We can write two equations:

1. c + w = 20 (total number of animals)
2. 2c + 4w = 70 (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation:

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to find the total number of slices first. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 7 x 8 = 56 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people, including Henry and his friends. So, we divide 56 slices by 4 people: 56 รท 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
