"I think I can figure this out. We got four houses, and we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, we know the person who plays the flute lives in the second house. Then, we know the person with the tulips lives right next to the person who plays the guitar. We also know the person with the lilies lives right next to the person with the carnations.

Now, we know the person who plays the piano lives in either the first or the fourth house, but since there's a house between the flute player and the piano player, the piano player must be in the fourth house.

So, if the flute player is in the second house, and the piano player is in the fourth house, that means the guitar player must be in the third house. And since the person with the tulips lives right next to the guitar player, that means the person with the tulips must be in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 3 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes different stuff, like fruits, drinks, colors, instruments, and gadgets. 

From what I understand, the person who likes green lives in the first house, and they eat kiwis. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, and they drink root beer. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, and they eat grapes.

Now, let's think about the cellist. We know that the cellist don't live in the second house, 'cause the person who likes blue and drinks root beer lives there. And we know that the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, so the cellist can't live there neither.

So, that means the cellist must live in the first house. But wait, the person who likes green and eats kiwis lives in the first house. That's okay, 'cause it don't say that the person who likes green and eats kiwis can't be the cellist.

So, I think the cellist lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all eat different fruits, drink different things, wear different shoes, play different sports, and like different colors.

From what I can see, the person who likes red lives in the second house (clue 7). And the cricketer lives next to the person who likes red (clue 2). So, the cricketer lives in either the first or the third house.

Now, the person who wears high heels lives to the right of the cricketer (clue 3). And the person who wears sandals lives next to the person who wears loafers (clue 10). The person who wears sandals also lives to the left of the person who eats a banana (clue 6).

The person who eats oranges lives to the left of the person who eats a banana (clue 13). And the baseball player lives to the left of the person who eats oranges (clue 8). But the person who likes red lives in the second house, so the baseball player must live in the first house.

Now, the person who wears boots lives to the right of the person who likes green (clue 1). And the person who wears high heels lives in the third house. So, the person who likes green must live in the first or second house. But the person who likes red lives in the second house, so the person who likes green must live in the first house.

So, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is (D) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got a bunch of people livin' in houses, and we gotta figger out where the tea drinker lives.

We know the person who is eatin' apples lives in the first house. We also know the person who had pizza and the person who is eatin' mangos live next to each other.

We also know the person who is wearin' high heels lives in the third house. And the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the tea drinker.

Now, let's try to put all this together. If the person who is eatin' apples lives in the first house, and the person who had pizza and the person who is eatin' mangos live next to each other, then the person who had pizza must live in the second house, and the person who is eatin' mangos must live in the third house.

But wait, we know the person who is wearin' high heels lives in the third house, so the person who is eatin' mangos must be wearin' high heels.

Now, let's go back to the person who drives a truck. We know they live to the right of the tea drinker. If the person who is eatin' apples lives in the first house, then the tea drinker must live in the first house too.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives, right? 

Alright, let's look at the clues. Clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. That's it, that's all we need. It's like, right there in black and white.

So, the answer is (A) 5."
"I think I can figger this out. Let's see... 

We got three houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all play different sports, eat different fruits, and got different flowers.

Now, I'm gonna look at the clues. 

First, the soccer player lives to the left of the person eatin' oranges. That means the person eatin' oranges can't be in the first house.

Next, the swimmer and the person with daffodils live right next to each other. That means they gotta be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.

Then, the person with tulips lives to the right of the person eatin' mangos. That means the person eatin' mangos can't be in the last house.

Last, the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eatin' oranges. That means the person eatin' oranges can't be in the last house, and the person with daffodils gotta be in house 2 or 3.

So, if we put it all together, the person eatin' oranges gotta be in the first house, and the person with daffodils gotta be in the second house, 'cause they live next to the swimmer and to the right of the person eatin' oranges.

Answer: (B)"
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and each house has a person with different stuff. We know the violinist lives in the first house, and they got a bouquet of daffodils.

Now, let's look at the clues. Clue 6 says the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live next to each other. Clue 8 says the history book buff lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

I think I can make a guess. If the violinist lives in the first house, and the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live next to each other, then the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house. If they lived in the third house, the person with a phone would have to live in the second house, but then the history book buff wouldn't be to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

So, I'm gonna say the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 3 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different gadgets, flowers, instruments, pets, and books. 

From what I understand, the mystery book reader lives in the second house. The history book buff lives next to the person with lilies, but we don't know who that is yet. The percussionist lives next to the person with a computer, and the person with a gameboy lives next to the person with roses.

Now, the bird keeper don't live in the first or third house, so they must live in the second house. But we already know the mystery book reader lives in the second house, so the bird keeper must be the mystery book reader. 

The fish enthusiast don't live in the first house, so they must live in the third house. The person with a computer lives in the third house, and the person with a gameboy lives next to the person with roses. Since the person with a gameboy can't live in the third house, they must live in the first house.

So, the person with a gameboy lives in the first house. That's the answer.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all got different fruits, pets, gadgets, and flowers. I'm gonna try to use the clues to figger out where the person with the phone lives.

From what I see, the person who owns horses lives in the third house. That's a good start. Now, the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who's eatin' grapes. That means the person eatin' grapes can't live in the first or second house, so they must live in the fourth or fifth house.

Now, let's look at the person with the dog. They live to the left of the person with the lilies. And there's one house between the dog owner and the person with the phone. That means the dog owner and the person with the phone can't live in the first and second houses or the fourth and fifth houses.

I'm also seein' that the person with the carnations lives to the right of the fish person, and they live next to the person with the radio. And there's one house between the person eatin' a banana and the person with the carnations.

I'm gettin' a little mixed up, but I think I see a pattern. The person eatin' a banana lives in the first house, and they got a dog. The person with the phone lives in the second house, and they got a fish. The person who owns horses lives in the third house, and they're eatin' oranges. The person eatin' grapes lives in the fourth house, and they got a bird. And the person eatin' kiwis lives in the fifth house, and they got a cat.

So, the person with the phone lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (E) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. So, we got two houses, one and two. And we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, the person with the convertible lives next to the history book person, but on the left. That means the history book person can't live in house one, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of it. So, the history book person lives in house two.

Now, we also know the person wearin' boots don't live in house one. That means the person in house one is wearin' sandals.

So, puttin' it all together, the person wearin' sandals lives in house one.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a diff'rent kind of book, and they all play diff'rent sports. 

We know the golfer lives in the first house. That's a good start. 

We also know the swimmer lives right next to the romance book lover. And the mystery book reader lives right next to the history book buff.

Now, let's think about this. If the golfer is in the first house, and the swimmer lives next to the romance book lover, that means the swimmer and the romance book lover gotta be in the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses.

But we also know the swimmer don't live in the third house. So, the swimmer and the romance book lover gotta be in the second and third houses.

Now, let's think about the mystery book reader and the history book buff. They gotta be in the third and fourth houses, or the second and third houses. But we already know the swimmer and the romance book lover are in the second and third houses. So, the mystery book reader and the history book buff gotta be in the third and fourth houses.

But wait, that don't work. The swimmer and the romance book lover are in the second and third houses, and the mystery book reader and the history book buff are in the third and fourth houses. That means the third house is taken by two people. That don't make sense.

So, let's try again. The golfer is in the first house. The swimmer and the romance book lover are in the second and third houses. And the mystery book reader and the history book buff are in the third and fourth houses. But that don't work.

Let's try again. The golfer is in the first house. The mystery book reader and the history book buff are in the second and third houses. And the swimmer and the romance book lover are in the third and fourth houses. But that don't work neither.

"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the mystery book reader lives, right? Alright, let's look at the clues. 

Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives in the third house. That's it, that's all we need. I don't gotta think about the other stuff. 

So, the answer is (B) 3."
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got three houses, and each person's got a thing they like and a thing they own. 

First, the person who likes green lives next to the person with a gameboy. Then, the person with a gameboy lives next to the person with a computer. That means the order is: green, gameboy, computer.

Now, the person who likes yellow don't live in the second house. That means they gotta live in the first or third house. But the first house is already taken by the person who likes green, so the person who likes yellow must live in the third house. And that's where the person with the computer lives.

So, the person with the computer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

So, we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different likes. We gotta find out where the coffee drinker lives.

From what I understand, the person who likes white lives 2 houses away from the coffee drinker. The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. The person who likes red lives in the 3rd house, and they like root beer.

The romance book lover lives next to the history book buff, but not in the 1st house. The history book buff don't live in the 4th house.

Now, let's think about this... If the person who likes white lives in the 1st house, the coffee drinker would be in the 4th house, 'cause there's 2 houses between 'em. But we don't know if the person who likes white lives in the 1st house.

If the person who likes green lives in the 1st house, the coffee drinker would be in the 3rd or 4th house, 'cause they live to the right of the person who likes green. But we know the person who likes red lives in the 3rd house, so the coffee drinker must live in the 4th house.

So, I think the coffee drinker lives in the 4th house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one and two. We know the person who likes green lives next to the person with the radio. That means the person who likes green lives in house one, 'cause they gotta be on the left of the person with the radio.

We also know the person who likes fantasy books lives in house one. That's the same person who likes green. Now we know house one is a fantasy book reader who likes green.

The person with the fish doesn't live in house one, so they live in house two. And the person who had pizza doesn't live in house one either, so they live in house two too.

Now we got house one: fantasy books and likes green. House two: has a radio, had pizza, and has fish.

Since the person in house two has fish, that means the person in house one must have a cat. So the cat lover lives in house one.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different pets, books, food, colors, and drinks.

From what I understand, the dog owner lives in the second house. And the person who likes red lives next to the dog owner, so that's the third house.

Now, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who likes red, so that's the first or second house. But the second house is already taken by the dog owner, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, but that's not possible, so the person who likes milk must live in the same house as the person who ate spaghetti, or to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. But the person who likes milk also lives to the left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes blue must live to the right of the person who likes milk.

Now, let's look at the drinks. We got tea, milk, water, root beer, and coffee. The coffee drinker lives to the right of the dog owner, so that's the third, fourth, or fifth house. But the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who likes blue must live in the third house. And the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the second house, but that's already taken by the dog owner. So, the person who likes milk must live in the first house, but that's already taken by the person who ate spaghetti. Wait, I'm confused.

Let me start again. The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who likes blue, and the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue must live next to each other. And the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house, and the person who likes blue must live in the second house, but that's already taken by the dog owner. So, the person who likes milk must live in the second house, but that's already taken by the dog owner. Wait, I'm confused again.

Let me think about this some more. Ah, I got it! The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who likes blue, and the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue must live next to each other. And the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house, and the person who likes blue must live in the second house, but that's already taken by the dog owner. So, the person who likes milk must live in the second house, but that's already taken by the dog owner. Wait, I'm confused again.

I'm gonna take a guess. I think the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (D) 5."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person who's eatin' kiwis lives, right? 

Alright, let's look at the clues. It says in clue 8 that the person who's eatin' kiwis lives in the first house. That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each person in 'em is eatin' different fruits, had different lunches, and got different flowers. 

Let's start with the person who had pizza. They live to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 6). And the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who had spaghetti (clue 7). So, we got: pizza, spaghetti, grilled cheese.

Now, the person who had grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other (clue 4). And the person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who had spaghetti. So, the person who had stew must live to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

We also know the person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 8). But the person who has a vase of tulips don't live in the fifth house (clue 3). So, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with different pets and flowers. 

First, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. That's from clue 5.

Now, clue 1 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. So, the dog owner can't live in the first house 'cause the cat lover's already there. And the person with tulips can't live in the first house neither. If they lived in the second house, the dog owner would have to live in the third house, but then we wouldn't have room for the person with horses and the person with carnations to have a house between 'em (clue 3). So, the person with tulips must live in the third house, and the dog owner lives in the fourth house.

Now we know the last two houses: 
- Third house: tulips
- Fourth house: dog owner

Clue 2 says the person with daffodils don't live in the second house. But we already know the cat lover lives in the first house, so the person with daffodils must live in the second house. But wait, that's what clue 2 says can't happen. So, the person with daffodils must live in the first or the fourth house. But the first house is taken by the cat lover, and the fourth house is taken by the dog owner. So, the person with daffodils must live in the second house, but that's not right. I'm all confused now.

Let me start again. We know the cat lover lives in the first house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house. The dog owner lives in the fourth house. Clue 3 says there's one house between the person with horses and the person with carnations. Clue 4 says the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with horses.

I think I got it now. The person with horses lives in the first house, but that's taken by the cat lover. So, the person with horses must live in the second house. Then the person with carnations lives in the fourth house, but that's taken by the dog owner. So, the person with carnations must live in the second or the third house. But the third house is taken by the person with tulips. So, the person with carnations lives in the second house, but that's taken by the person with horses. I'm all confused again.

Wait a minute. What if the person with horses lives in the second house, and the person with carnations lives in the fourth house? No, that can't be right. The dog owner lives in the fourth house.

I think I got it now. The person with horses lives in the second house, and the person with lilies lives in the third house. But the third house is taken by the person with tulips. So, the person with lilies lives in the fourth house, but that's taken by the dog owner. I'm all confused again.

Let me think about this some more. We know the cat lover lives in the first house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house. The dog owner lives in the fourth house.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two houses, one and two. Each person got different stuff. One's got boots, one's got high heels. One's got horses, one's got a dog. And one's got a phone, one's got a radio.

We know the person with the phone lives in house one. That's a fact. And we know the person with boots don't live in house two. That means the person with boots lives in house one.

Now, the person with horses and the person with the radio live next to each other. Since the person with the radio lives in house two, the person with horses must live in house one.

So, if the person with horses lives in house one, and the person with boots lives in house one, that means the person with high heels lives in house two.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all like different colors, eat different fruits, wear different shoes, and all that.

Let's start with the person who ate grilled cheese. They live next to the person with a computer (clue 1). And the person with a computer lives next to the person wearin' loafers (clue 9). So, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person wearin' loafers live next to each other.

The person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the third house (clue 2), and the person wearin' loafers don't live in the third house neither (clue 6). So, they must live in the first and second houses.

The person who likes blue lives in the first house (we can figger this out from clue 5 and clue 10). And the person who's eatin' mangos lives next to the person who likes yellow (clue 8). So, the person who's eatin' mangos lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

Now, the person who's eatin' grapes lives next to the person who's wearin' boots (clue 4). And the person who's wearin' boots lives in the third house (we can figger this out from the other clues).

So, we got the person who likes blue in the first house, the person who likes yellow in the second house, and the person who's wearin' boots in the third house. That means the person who likes green lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all play different sports, and they all got different pets. 

From what I understand, the baseball player lives in the second house. The basketball player don't live in the first house, and they live to the left of the swimmer. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. The bird keeper don't live in the first house, and they don't live in the third house. The tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. The bird keeper can't live in the first or third house, so they must live in the fourth house. But we gotta make sure this works with the other clues.

If the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, the cat lover must live in the third house, 'cause the tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover. But then the tennis player would live in the second house, and that's where the baseball player lives. So that don't work.

Let's try again. If the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, the cat lover could live in the second house, but that's where the baseball player lives. So the cat lover must live in the first house, and the tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover, but that don't make sense 'cause the tennis player would live in a house that don't exist.

Wait a minute... If the cat lover lives in the third house, the tennis player lives in the second house, but that's where the baseball player lives. So the cat lover must live in the second house, but that's where the baseball player lives. Unless... the cat lover lives in the first house, and the tennis player lives in the second house, but that's where the baseball player lives.

I'm gettin' all confused. Let me start again. The bird keeper don't live in the first house, and they don't live in the third house. The baseball player lives in the second house. The cat lover lives to the right of the tennis player. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.

If the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, the cat lover could live in the third house, and the tennis player lives in the second house, but that's where the baseball player lives. So the cat lover must live in the first house, and the tennis player lives in... uh... I don't know.

You know what? I think I made a mistake. The bird keeper don't live in the first house, and they don't live in the third house. The baseball player lives in the second house. The cat lover lives to the right of the tennis player. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.

If the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, the cat lover could live in the third house, and the tennis player lives in the second house, but that's where the baseball player lives. So the cat lover must live in the first house, and the tennis player lives in... uh... I don't know.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They like different colors, drive different cars, play different instruments, got different gadgets, and play different sports.

From what I understand, the person who likes white lives to the right of the person with a computer. That means the person with a computer is in house 1, and the person who likes white is in either house 2 or 3.

The person with a sedan lives next to the person with a gameboy, and they're next to each other. The person with a sedan also lives to the left of the person with an SUV.

The violinist ain't in house 1, and the guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. The person with a computer is in house 1. The person who likes white is in house 2, 'cause the guitarist lives to the right of 'em. The person with a sedan is in house 2, and the person with an SUV is in house 3.

The person with a gameboy is in house 2, 'cause they live next to the person with a sedan. The swimmer lives to the right of the person with an SUV, but that don't make sense, so the swimmer must be in house 2, and the person with an SUV is in house 3.

The person who likes blue is in house 3, and the guitarist is in house 3 too. The violinist is in house 2.

The only sport left is soccer, and the only house left is house 1. So, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. So, we gotta find out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives, right? 

Alright, let's look at the clues. Clue 11 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (E) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all play different instruments, wear different shoes, eat different fruits, and got different gadgets.

From what I understand, the person who eats oranges lives to the right of the person who eats kiwis. And the person who eats kiwis lives to the left of the person who wears boots. So, we got kiwis, boots, oranges from left to right.

Now, the person who eats oranges lives right next to the person who's got a TV. So, the TV's gotta be in the same row as the oranges. But we only got 3 houses, so the TV's probably in the same house as the oranges.

The person who wears high heels lives next to the pianist. And the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who wears high heels. So, we got radio, high heels, pianist from left to right.

The pianist ain't in the first house, so the radio, high heels, and pianist must be in houses 1, 2, and 3. But we already know the order of the kiwis, boots, and oranges. So, we gotta fit 'em together.

I think I got it! The person who eats kiwis is in house 1, and they got a radio. The person who wears boots is in house 1 too, but that don't make sense. So, the person who wears boots must be in house 1, and the person who eats kiwis is in house 1 too, but that's not right. Wait, I got it! The person who eats kiwis is in house 1, and they got a radio, and they're a percussionist, and they wear running shoes.

The person who wears high heels is in house 2, and they live next to the pianist. And the person who eats oranges is in house 3, and they got a TV.

So, the person who's got a TV lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta find out who lives where.

From what I see, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. And the person who eats a banana lives right next to 'em. 

Now, the person who eats apples also lives in the third house, so that means the person who likes milk must be eatin' apples too.

The person who drinks water lives next to the person who likes yellow, and the person who owns a sedan lives next to the person who likes yellow too. So, the person who owns a sedan must live on the other side of the person who likes yellow.

The person who likes red lives to the left of the person who drinks water, and the person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who likes red. That means the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.

The person who likes blue lives next to the person who drives a truck, but we don't know where they live yet.

The person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who likes milk, so they must live in the fourth or fifth house.

The person who eats mangos lives next to the person who likes green, but we don't know where they live yet.

And finally, there's two houses between the person who drinks root beer and the person who eats kiwis.

Puttin' all these clues together, I think I got it:

House 1: The person who drives a convertible, eats kiwis, and likes red.
House 2: The person who likes blue, drinks root beer, and eats a banana.
House 3: The person who likes milk, eats apples, and drinks coffee.
House 4: The person who owns a sedan, likes yellow, and drinks water.
House 5: The person who owns an SUV, likes green, and eats mangos, and drinks tea.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and each one's got a person with a different car and a different fruit. 

First, we know the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house. That's from clue 5. 

Now, the person with the truck don't live in the first house (clue 3) and don't live in the third house (clue 1). So, the person with the truck must live in the second house.

The person with the SUV don't live in the third house (clue 2). And since the person with the truck lives in the second house, the person with the SUV must live in the first house. But wait, the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house. That's okay, maybe the person with the SUV is the same person eatin' kiwis.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. That's a fact.

Then, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives right next to the person who ate fried rice, but on the left side. So, that means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

We also know the swimmer lives in the first house. That's all we know about the first house so far.

And last, we know the cricketer don't live in the third house. That's all we know about the cricketer.

So, puttin' it all together, we got:

House 1: Swimmer (don't know what they ate)
House 2: Spaghetti (don't know what sport they play)
House 3: Fried rice (don't know what sport they play)

The question asks where the person who ate spaghetti lives. We already figgered that out - they live in the second house.

So, the answer is:
(B) 2"
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out where the person with boots lives.

From what I understand, the person who likes blue lives in the 5th house. The person who likes white lives in the 4th house. The person who likes red lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. The person who likes green lives in the 1st house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the 2nd house.

Now, the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the person who wears boots. The person who wears boots lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. The person who drives a minivan lives two houses away from the person who wears loafers.

I think the person who wears boots lives in the 2nd house. I'm not really sure, but it seems like it could be right.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the history book buff lives, right? 

Alright, let's look at the clues. It says the history book buff lives in the first house. That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got a bunch of people livin' in houses, and they all like different stuff. We gotta find out where the person who's eatin' apples lives.

Let's start with what we know. The soccer player lives in the first house. And the person who's eatin' kiwis lives in the third house. That's from clues 8 and 14.

Now, the person who's eatin' apples can't live in the first house 'cause that's where the soccer player lives. And they can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the kiwi person lives. And they can't live in the second house, that's just a rule (clue 3).

So, that leaves us with the fourth and fifth houses. But the person who's eatin' apples can't live in the fifth house 'cause the flutist lives to the right of 'em, and the flutist can't live in the fifth house (clue 16).

So, that means the person who's eatin' apples must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got three houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, favorite colors, shoes, and book types. 

From what I understand, the person who likes yellow lives next to the person wearin' boots. And the person who likes yellow don't live in the first or third house, so they must live in the second house. 

The person who likes history books also lives in the second house, and they got daffodils. So, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes history books must be the same person. 

The person wearin' loafers lives in the third house. And the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearin' high heels. 

Now, let's think about the person who likes green. They can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the person who likes yellow and history books lives. And they can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. 

So, the person who likes green must live in the first house. 

The answer is (A) 1."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person with runnin' shoes lives. 

From what I read, it says right there in the first clue that the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 3 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all got different pets, play different sports, and drive different cars. 

Clue 1 says the person with the truck lives to the right of the basketball player. That means the basketball player can't live in house 3, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of it.

Clue 2 says the cricketer lives in house 1. That's a good start.

Clue 3 says the cat lover lives to the right of the person with the sedan. That's a bit tricky, but we'll get to it later.

Clue 4 says the person with horses lives to the left of the person with the sedan. That's another good clue.

Now, let's put it all together. The cricketer lives in house 1. The person with horses lives to the left of the person with the sedan, so the person with horses must live in house 2, and the person with the sedan lives in house 3.

Now, we know the person with the truck lives to the right of the basketball player. The only person left is the person with the birds, and they must live in house 1 or 2. But the cricketer lives in house 1, so the person with the birds must live in house 2, but the person with horses lives in house 2. So, the person with the birds must live in house 1, but the cricketer lives in house 1. Wait, that don't make sense.

Let me start again. The cricketer lives in house 1. The person with horses lives to the left of the person with the sedan, so the person with horses must live in house 2, and the person with the sedan lives in house 3.

Wait, what if the basketball player lives in house 1, and the cricketer is not the basketball player, but the cricketer lives in house 1, and the basketball player lives in house 1. No, that can't be right.

I got it. The cricketer lives in house 1, and they can be the cat lover. The person with the horses lives in house 2, and the person with the sedan lives in house 3.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different gadgets, pets, instruments, cars, and flowers. We gotta use the clues to figger out where the person with the tulips lives.

From what I see, the person with the radio lives in the 4th house. And the person with the tulips lives to the right of the person with the saxophone. The person with the saxophone lives in the 4th house, so the person with the tulips gotta live in the 5th house.

I'm gonna look at the other clues, but I think I got it. The person with the tulips lives in the 5th house.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all wear different shoes, got different cars, ate different lunch, and like different drinks.

From what I understand, the person who likes root beer lives next to the person who ate fried rice. The person wearin' loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. The person who likes milk lives in the third house. The person who likes root beer lives next to the person who owns an SUV.

Now, let's look at the houses. We know the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the second house. The person who likes milk lives in the third house, and they ate grilled cheese. So, the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house.

The person who owns a sedan can't live in the second or third house, 'cause we already know who lives there. And it can't live in the fourth house, 'cause the person who likes root beer lives there, and they live next to the person who owns an SUV. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house, but that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. Wait, that don't make sense.

Let me think... If the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, then the person wearin' loafers can't live there. But we know the person wearin' loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese, and that person lives in the third house. So, the person wearin' loafers must live in the second house, but that's where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives.

I'm all confused now. Let me start again. If the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, 'cause there's two houses between 'em. But we know the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house, and they live next to the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who owns a sedan can't live in the fourth house.

I think I got it now. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, no, that can't be right. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, no, that's where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, no, that's where the person who likes milk lives. The person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, no, that's where the person who likes root beer lives.

Wait, I got it! The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, no, that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. The person wearin' loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese, and that person lives in the third house. So, the person wearin' loafers lives in the second house, no, that's where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, no, that's where the person wearin' loafers lives, but the person wearin' loafers lives in the second house, no...

I'm all confused now. I think I need to start again from scratch. 

Let's see... The person who owns a sedan lives in... (A) 3, (B) 1, (C) 4, or (D) 2.

I'm gonna take a wild guess and say... (B) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. Let's go through the clues one by one.

We know the saxophonist lives in the second house, that's clue 3. And the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, that's clue 10.

Now, clue 5 says the cellist lives right next to the tea drinker, but on the left side. So if the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the cellist gotta be in the third house.

That's my answer: (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

So, we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all like different sports, got different cars, like different drinks, and got different flowers in their houses.

From what I understand, the person who drives a minivan lives in the 4th house. The person who likes root beer lives in the 3rd house. The basketball player lives next to the person who drives a truck. 

Now, the person who drives a truck lives next to the person who got carnations in their house. And the person who got lilies lives next to the person who got daffodils.

I think I got it! The person who drives a truck lives in the 2nd house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. One person drinks tea, one drinks coffee, and one drinks water. They all got different cars, and they like different kinds of books and fruits.

From what I understand, the tea drinker lives in the first house, and they're eatin' apples. The person eatin' apples lives to the left of the person drivin' a minivan. So, the minivan must be in the second or third house.

Now, the person drivin' a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. And there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker.

I'm thinkin' the person eatin' oranges can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. And the person drivin' a minivan must live in the third house too, 'cause the person eatin' apples lives to the left of 'em.

So, if the person drivin' a minivan lives in the third house, and the person eatin' oranges lives in the third house, that means the person eatin' oranges is also drivin' a minivan. And the science fiction book fanatic must live in the second house.

Now, there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. So, if the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house, and the coffee drinker must live in the third house. But wait, the person eatin' oranges and drivin' a minivan lives in the third house!

I'm all confused now. Let me start again. If the tea drinker lives in the first house, and the person eatin' apples lives to the left of the person drivin' a minivan, that means the person drivin' a minivan can't live in the first house. And the person eatin' oranges can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house.

So, the person drivin' a minivan must live in the second house, and the person eatin' oranges must live in the third house. And the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, 'cause the person drivin' a convertible lives to the right of 'em.

Now, there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. So, if the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house, and the coffee drinker must live in the second house. But wait, the person drivin' a minivan lives in the second house!

I'm all confused again. Let me think... If the person drivin' a minivan lives in the second house, and the person eatin' oranges lives in the third house, that means the coffee drinker must live in the first house. But the tea drinker lives in the first house!

I got it! The coffee drinker can't live in the first house, 'cause the tea drinker lives there. And the coffee drinker can't live in the second house, 'cause the person drivin' a minivan lives there. So, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, but the person eatin' oranges lives there! Unless... unless the person eatin' oranges is also the coffee drinker!

So, the answer is (A) 3."
"Let's think this through. We got three houses, and each person likes a different color and a different kind of book. 

We know the person who likes red lives in the second house. And the person who likes red lives right next to the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now, we know the person who likes white doesn't live in the third house. That means they must live in either the first or second house. But the second house is already taken by the person who likes red. So, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

We also know the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house. But wait, that's not true. They can live in the first house. And that's where they must live, 'cause the second house is taken by the person who likes red, and the third house is taken by the mystery book reader.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house. 

The answer is (C) 1."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person with the SUV lives, right? I read through all the clues, and I found one that says the person with the SUV lives in the third house. That's it, that's all I need.

So, the answer is:
(A) 3"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They're eatin' different fruits, got different flowers, play different instruments, drink different things, and got different gadgets.

From what I understand, the person with the TV lives next to the tea drinker. And the tea drinker ain't in the middle house. So, the tea drinker's either in the first or the last house. 

If the tea drinker's in the last house, then the person with the TV's in the middle house. But that don't work 'cause the person with the TV's gotta be next to the guitarist, and the guitarist can't be in the last house if the tea drinker's there.

So, the tea drinker's in the first house, and the person with the TV's in the middle house. The person with the TV's also got a rose bouquet, 'cause that's what's in the middle house.

The person with the tulips lives next to the person with the radio. And the person with the radio's in the first house, so the person with the tulips is in the last house.

Now, there's one house between the flutist and the person eatin' a banana. The person with the TV's in the middle house, so the flutist's in the first house, and the person eatin' a banana's in the last house.

The person eatin' kiwis lives next to the coffee drinker. But the person eatin' a banana's in the last house, so the person eatin' kiwis must be in the middle house, and the coffee drinker's in the first house. And the person with the radio's in the first house, so the coffee drinker's the one with the radio.

The person with the TV's in the middle house, the person with the radio's in the first house, and the person with the tulips is in the last house. The person eatin' a banana's in the last house, the person eatin' kiwis is in the middle house, and the person eatin' apples is in the first house.

The person with the TV's in the middle house, the guitarist's in the last house, and the flutist's in the first house.

The tea drinker's in the first house, the person with the TV's in the middle house, and the guitarist's in the last house. The coffee drinker's in the first house, the person eatin' kiwis is in the middle house, and the person eatin' a banana's in the last house.

The only drink left is root beer, and the only house left is the middle house. But the person in the middle house is eatin' kiwis and has a TV. Wait, that don't make sense. I think I messed up. The person in the middle house is the root beer lover, and the tea drinker's in the first house.

The answer is (B)."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a diff'rent kind of book, eats a diff'rent kind of fruit, and wears diff'rent shoes.

From what I understand, the fantasy book person lives in the third house. The history book person lives to the left of the fantasy book person, so that means the history book person lives in the second house.

Now, the science fiction book person lives to the right of the fantasy book person. That means the science fiction book person can't live in the first or second house. The science fiction book person can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the fantasy book person lives. So, the science fiction book person must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one and two. Each person in the houses is different. They ate different food, play different music, wear different shoes, like different colors, and got different cars.

We know the person who ate fried rice don't live in the first house. So, the person in the first house must've ate spaghetti. We also know the person who owns an SUV don't live in the second house, so the person in the second house owns a sedan.

Now, the person who plays the flute lives next to the person who likes white. And the person who wears loafers also lives next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white can't live in the first house 'cause there ain't nobody to the left, they must live in the second house.

So, the person in the first house wears loafers, and the person in the second house likes white. The person in the first house ate spaghetti, and the person in the second house must've ate fried rice.

Now we know the person in the first house wears loafers, so the person in the second house must be wearin' sandals.

The person who is wearin' sandals lives in house number 2.

Answer: (B)"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, fruits, cars, instruments, and drinks.

From what I understand, the person who only drinks water lives next to the person with a minivan. But the person who only drinks water don't live in the first house. So, they must live in the second house, and the person with the minivan lives in the first house.

Now, the person with the sedan lives next to the person with daffodils. But the person with the sedan can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the root beer lover lives. And the person with the minivan lives in the first house, so the person with the sedan must live in the first house too. But wait, that don't make sense. So, the person with the sedan lives in the first house, and the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

The person with the sedan also lives next to the person eating apples. So, the person eating apples lives in the second house.

Now, the person eating apples lives next to the violinist. And the violinist can't live in the first house 'cause that's where the person with the sedan lives, and the person with the minivan. And the violinist can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the person eating apples lives. So, the violinist must live in the third house.

But we already know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the violinist must be the root beer lover.

The answer is (B)."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta find out where the person wearin' loafers lives.

First, let's look at the clues. We know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. We also know the person wearin' high heels lives in the second house.

Now, let's think about the cat lover and the dog owner. They gotta live next to each other, and the cat lover lives to the left of the dog owner. We also know the person wearin' loafers lives to the right of the cat lover.

We can't put the cat lover in the second house 'cause that's where the person wearin' high heels lives. And we can't put the cat lover in the third house 'cause that's where the person who likes yellow lives.

So, the cat lover must live in the first house, and the dog owner lives in the second house, but that's already taken. So, the dog owner must live in a different house.

Let's try again. The cat lover lives in the first house, and the person wearin' high heels lives in the second house. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

Now, we know the person wearin' loafers lives to the right of the cat lover, and there's one house between the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearin' loafers.

We also know the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

So, the person wearin' loafers must live in the fourth house, but that's where the person who likes blue lives. Wait, no! The person who likes blue can live in the fourth house, and the person wearin' loafers can live in the... no, that's not it.

Let me think again. If the person wearin' loafers lives to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in the first house, then the person wearin' loafers can live in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house. But we already know who lives in the second and third houses.

And we know there's one house between the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearin' loafers. So, the person wearin' loafers can't live in the fifth house.

That means the person wearin' loafers must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got two houses, one and two. And we know the person in house one has a TV. That's a fact. Now, the person with the lilies don't live in house one, so they must live in house two. 

Now, since the person in house one has a TV, the person in house two must have the computer, 'cause they can't have the same thing. 

So, the person with the computer lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got two houses, one and two, and we gotta find out where the percussionist lives.

First, we know the science fiction book person lives to the left of the golfer. That means the science fiction person lives in house one, and the golfer lives in house two.

Next, we know the person who had pizza and the history book person live next to each other. Since the science fiction person lives in house one, the history book person must live in house two. That means the person who had pizza lives in house one.

Now, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. If the person with daffodils lives in house one, the guitarist would have to live in house two, but we already know the golfer lives in house two. So, the person with daffodils must live in house one, and the guitarist lives in house two.

Let's see what we got so far:

- House one: science fiction book person, had pizza, has daffodils
- House two: golfer, history book person, has tulips (cuz the other person has daffodils), guitarist

The only one left is the percussionist. Since the guitarist lives in house two, the percussionist must live in house one.

So, the percussionist lives in house one.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different pets, instruments, and devices.

From what I understand, the person with horses lives in the first house, and the fish person lives next to 'em in the second house.

The violinist lives in the fourth house, and the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's think about the person with the television. They live to the left of the person with the gameboy, and the person with the gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist. The guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist.

So, if we put the percussionist in the first house, it don't work 'cause the person with horses is already there. If we put the percussionist in the second house, it don't work 'cause the fish person is already there.

If we put the percussionist in the third house, it might work. The guitarist can live in the fourth house, but that's where the violinist lives. So, the guitarist must live in a different house.

So, let's think about this again. The person with the television lives to the left of the person with the gameboy, and the person with the gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist. The guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist.

If we put the percussionist in the first house, it don't work. If we put the percussionist in the second house, it don't work. If we put the percussionist in the third house, it might work.

"I think I can figure this out. Let's see... 

We got two houses, one and two. Each person in the houses got some stuff that's different from the other person. They got different flowers, fruits, sports, devices, and instruments.

Now, let's look at the clues. 
1. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. That means the person eating apples can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of house 2. So, the person eating apples lives in house 1.

2. The person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist. Since the person eating apples lives in house 1, the person with the radio must live in house 2. And 'cause the person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist, the violinist must live in house 1.

3. The person with the lilies lives in house 1. That's good, we already knew that.

4. The basketball player don't live in house 1. That means the basketball player lives in house 2.

So, we got:
- House 1: person eating apples, got lilies, and plays the violin.
- House 2: person with the radio, and plays basketball.

The violinist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all play different sports, and they all ate different lunches.

We know the tennis player lives in the third house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. The golfer lives in the fourth house. 

Now, the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti, they don't live next to each other. There's one house between 'em. And the person who had stew lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who had pizza lives to the left of the cricketer. That means the cricketer can't live in the first house, 'cause there ain't nobody to the left of the first house. And the cricketer can't live in the third house, 'cause that's where the tennis player lives.

So, let's try to put the people in order. The person who had pizza lives in the first house. That means the cricketer lives in the second house. Then we got the tennis player in the third house. The golfer lives in the fourth house, but the person who had stew lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who had stew must be the golfer.

Now we got: pizza, cricketer, tennis player, golfer (who had stew), and the person who ate spaghetti. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, and that's the soccer player. And the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the fifth house, 'cause that's where the soccer player lives. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house, but that's not right. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house, but the soccer player lives in the fifth house too, and they can't both live in the same house. Wait, I got it! The person who ate spaghetti can't live in the fifth house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the fifth house, no, that's not it. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, no, that's not it either. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, no... The person who ate fried rice lives to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, no... The person who ate pizza lives in the first house, and the cricketer lives to the right of the person who ate pizza. The person who ate fried rice lives to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got two houses, one and two, and we gotta figger out who's wearin' loafers.

We know the person wearin' runnin' shoes don't live in house one, so they must live in house two. That means the person wearin' loafers lives in house one.

We also know the person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. And the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the baseball player. And the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water.

So, if we put all this together, we can see that the person who likes white, the baseball player, and the person who only drinks water all live in house one. And the person who ate spaghetti, the person wearin' runnin' shoes, and the swimmer live in house two.

Now, we know the person who likes milk lives in house two, 'cause they can't live in house one with the person who only drinks water. And the person who ate stew must live in house one, 'cause they can't live in house two with the person who ate spaghetti.

So, we got all the people accounted for, and we know the person wearin' loafers lives in house one.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. So we got 3 houses, and each person's different. They all like different fruits and drinks. 

First, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eatin' mangos. That means the coffee drinker's in house 1 or 2, and the mango eater's in house 2 or 3.

Next, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. That means the root beer lover can't be in house 3, 'cause there ain't nobody to the right of 'em.

Then, it says the root beer lover don't live in house 2. So, that means they gotta live in house 1.

Lastly, it says the person eatin' oranges don't live in house 2. That's okay, 'cause we already figgered out the root beer lover lives in house 1.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got three houses, and each house got a person. Each person ate somethin' different for lunch, and they're all wearin' different shoes.

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. We also know the person who ate fried rice don't live in the second house. And the person who's wearin' boots lives right next to the person who ate fried rice.

So, if the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and the person who's wearin' boots lives next to the person who ate fried rice, that means the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house. And the person who's wearin' boots must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person who's wearin' loafers don't live in the first house. And we already know who lives in the first and second houses. So, the person who's wearin' loafers must live in the third house, but that can't be right 'cause the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, and we don't know what shoes they're wearin'.

Wait a minute... If the person who's wearin' boots lives in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, that means the person who's wearin' loafers must live in the second house, but that's where the person who's wearin' boots lives. So, the person who's wearin' loafers must live in the... no, that can't be right.

I got it! The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and they're wearin' runnin' shoes. The person who's wearin' boots lives in the second house, and they ate pizza. And the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, and they're wearin' loafers.

So, the person who's wearin' loafers lives in house (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. I ain't no expert, but I'll give it a shot.

Okay, so we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different cars, food, fruit, books, and devices. We gotta figger out where the mystery book reader lives.

Let's start with the clues. Clue 11 says the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house. Clue 16 says the romance book lover and the mystery book reader live next to each other.

Now, clue 3 says the romance book lover don't live in the fifth house. And clue 5 says the person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the fifth house neither.

Clue 18 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live next to each other. And clue 7 says the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

So, if we put it all together, we can see that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a phone lives in the fifth house.

Now, clue 15 says the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house. And clue 4 says the person who ate fried rice don't live in the first house.

Clue 8 says there's one house between the person who had stew and the person who had pizza. And clue 9 says the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Clue 12 says the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who has a radio. And clue 14 says there's two houses between the person who has a gameboy and the person who is eating grapes.

Now, let's look at the houses. We know the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house. And we know the person who has a phone lives in the fifth house.

We also know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house. And the person who is eating oranges lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

So, if we put it all together, we can see that the mystery book reader lives in the second house.

The answer is (E) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about 5 houses and the people livin' in 'em. Each person got different shoes, pets, drinks, and flowers. 

From what I can see, the dog owner lives in the third house. The person with the carnations arrangement lives next to the bird keeper, and the bird keeper lives next to the person wearin' loafers. The person wearin' runnin' shoes lives next to the bird keeper too.

The person who likes milk lives next to the person who only drinks water, and there's two houses between the person who only drinks water and the person wearin' boots. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives two houses away from the person who owns horses.

Now, let's try to put all this together. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house, the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the second house, the bird keeper lives in the third house, but wait, the dog owner lives in the third house. So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the dog owner lives in the third house, the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, and the root beer lover lives in the fifth house.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

The answer is (B)."
"I think I can figure this out. We got two houses, one and two. One person lives in each house. They like different books and play different sports.

We know the person who likes mystery books lives in house one. That means the person who likes fantasy books can't live in house one, 'cause they like different books. So, the fantasy book person must live in house two.

I don't really care about the sports part, 'cause we already figured out the book thing. But if you wanna know, the tennis player lives in house two too, 'cause they don't live in house one.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all like different colors, play different instruments, wear different shoes, eat different food, and got different flowers.

From what I understand, the person wearin' loafers lives in the 4th house. That's a good start.

Now, the person who had pizza and the person with daffodils live next to each other. And the person with daffodils don't live in the 3rd house. So, they must live in the 2nd house, and the person who had pizza lives in the 1st house.

The person wearin' runnin' shoes lives next to the person with daffodils, so they live in the 1st house.

The person who likes white lives to the right of the person wearin' runnin' shoes. That means they can't live in the 1st house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives. They can't live in the 2nd house neither, 'cause that's where the person with daffodils lives. And they can't live in the 4th house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. So, the person who likes white must live in the 3rd house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff they like and do. We gotta use the clues to figger out where the person who only drinks water lives.

From what I see, the cellist lives in the first house. That's clue 4. Then, clue 12 says the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker. That means the person who only drinks water can't live in the fourth house, 'cause there ain't nobody to the right of 'em.

Now, clue 9 says the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk. That means they gotta live next to each other. And clue 7 says the flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, we got a little chain goin' on here.

I think I see a pattern. If the cellist lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker, then the person who only drinks water must live in the... third house! That's right, option (D).

So, the answer is (D) 3."
"I think I can figger this out. So, we got 3 houses and people livin' in 'em. We know the person who likes red lives in the first house, 'cause that's what it says in clue 1. And then it says in clue 7 that the person eatin' grapes lives in the first house too. So, that means the person who likes red is the same one eatin' grapes, and they live in the first house.

So, the answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about 5 houses and the people livin' in 'em. Each person got a different pet, device, shoes, sport, and flowers.

From what I can see, the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. They're also the dog owner, the tennis player, and the fish enthusiast.

The person wearin' high heels lives in the second house. They're also the cat lover and the person who owns horses.

The person wearin' boots lives in the third house.

The person wearin' loafers lives in the fourth house. They're also the swimmer.

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's try to find the person who has a bouquet of lilies. They live to the right of the basketball player. I think the basketball player lives in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the... no, that can't be right. The person wearin' boots lives in the third house.

Wait a minute"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got two houses, one and two. And we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, the person eatin' kiwis lives in house one. That's a good start.

Then we know the bird keeper and the person wearin' high heels live next to each other. That means they gotta be in house one and two, but I don't know which one's which yet.

Next, the tennis player and the person eatin' apples live next to each other. We already know the person eatin' apples lives in house two, so the tennis player must live in house one.

We also know the person who likes science fiction books lives in house two. That's a good clue.

And last, the dog owner don't live in house one. So the bird keeper must live in house one, and the dog owner lives in house two.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House one: Kiwi, Bird keeper, Tennis player, Mystery books, Sandals
- House two: Apple, Dog owner, ?, Science fiction books, High heels

The only thing left is the cricketer. Since the tennis player's in house one, the cricketer must be in house two.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Alright, so we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all got different pets, food, sports, and fruits. 

From what I understand, the person who ate oranges lives in the second house, and they're a swimmer. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house, and they live next to the person who ate grilled cheese. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, and the cat lover lives to the left of them. 

Now, let's try to figger out who's eatin' grapes. We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and the person who's eatin' oranges lives in the second house. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house. 

The person who's eatin' mangos lives in the first house, 'cause they live to the left of the person who's eatin' oranges. The person who's eatin' apples lives in the fourth house, 'cause the bird keeper lives to the right of them, and the bird keeper can't live in the fifth house 'cause that's where the person who had pizza lives. The person who's eatin' kiwis lives in the third house, 'cause there's one house between them and the dog owner, and the dog owner can't live in the first house 'cause that's where the person who ate spaghetti lives. 

So, the person who's eatin' grapes must live in the first house, but that's where the person who ate spaghetti lives, and they're eatin' mangos. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' oranges lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' kiwis lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' apples lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the fifth house 'cause that's where the person who had pizza lives. Wait, I made a mistake! The person who's eatin' grapes must live in the first house, but that's where the person who ate spaghetti lives, and they're eatin' mangos. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' oranges lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' kiwis lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' apples lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the fifth house 'cause that's where the person who had pizza lives. I'm all confused now! 

Oh, I got it! The person who's eatin' grapes lives in the first house, but that's where the person who ate spaghetti lives, and they're eatin' mangos. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' oranges lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' kiwis lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's where the person who's eatin' apples lives. The person who's eatin' grapes can't live in the fifth house 'cause that's where the person who had pizza lives. I'm all confused now!

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

Let's start with what we know. The person who likes green lives in the first house. The person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes blue. The person who likes red lives next to the person who has carnations. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about it. If the person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes blue, and the person who likes blue can't live in the first house 'cause the person who likes green lives there, then the person who had pizza must live in either the second or third house.

But wait, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza can't live in the fourth house, so the person who had pizza must live in either the second or third house.

Now, let's look at the other clues. The person who likes red lives next to the person who has carnations, and the person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes blue. So, the person who likes red and the person who has carnations must live in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses.

But we already know the person who likes green lives in the first house, so the person who likes red and the person who has carnations must live in the second and third houses.

So, the person who had pizza must live in the second house, 'cause it's the only house left.

The answer is (D) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. We got two houses, one and two. Each person's doin' somethin' different. They're eatin' different fruits, drivin' different cars, and playin' different sports.

We know the person eatin' grapes don't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. We also know the baseball player lives in the second house, and the person with the convertible lives in the second house too.

Now, I ain't got no info about the person eatin' mangos, but I know they can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the grape eater lives. So, the person eatin' mangos must live in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got three houses and three people. Each person likes a different color and eats a different fruit. 

We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. And the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis. So, the person who eats kiwis must live in the third house.

Now, the person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who eats oranges. If the person who eats kiwis is in the third house, then the person who eats oranges must be in the second house, but that's where the person who likes blue lives. So, the person who eats oranges must be in the second house, and the person who eats apples must be in the first house.

But wait, that can't be right. The person who likes blue is in the second house, so the person who eats oranges must be in the first or second house. If the person who eats oranges is in the first house, then the person who eats apples must be to the left of them, but there's no house to the left of the first house. So, the person who eats oranges must be in the second house, and the person who eats apples must be in the first house, but that's not possible. So, the person who eats oranges must be in the second house, and the person who eats apples must be in the first house, no... that's not it. 

Let me try again. The person who eats oranges is in the second house, no... that's not it. The person who eats apples is in the first house, and the person who eats oranges is in the second house, no... that's not it. 

Okay, let me think. The person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who eats oranges. The person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis. The person who eats kiwis lives in the third house. 

So, the person who eats oranges lives in the second house, and the person who eats apples lives in the first house. But the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who eats oranges can't live in the second house. The person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who eats oranges, so the person who eats oranges must live in the second or third house. But the person who eats kiwis lives in the third house, so the person who eats oranges must live in the second house, but that's where the person who likes blue lives. 

Okay, let me think. The person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who eats oranges. The person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis. The person who eats kiwis lives in the third house.

"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We know some stuff about the people in these houses, but not everything.

We know the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. That means the soccer player is in house 1, and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

We also know the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader. That means the person with a gameboy is in house 1, and that's the same house as the soccer player. So, the person in house 1 has a gameboy and plays soccer.

Now, we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. We don't know who has the rose bouquet, but we know the root beer lover can't be in house 1 because they have to be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, then the root beer lover would have to be in a house that doesn't exist (since there's only two houses). So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

That means the person in house 1 has a gameboy, plays soccer, and has a rose bouquet. The person in house 2 is the mystery book reader and the root beer lover.

So, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with different pets and cars. 

From what I understand, the person with the fish lives next to the person with the dog. And the person with the truck lives next to the person with the sedan. 

Also, the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the fish. And there's two houses between the person with the truck and the person with the dog.

Now, let's think about this. If the person with the truck lives in house 1, and the person with the sedan lives in house 2, that means the person with the fish and the person with the dog gotta live in houses 3 and 4. But we know the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the fish, so the person with the fish must live in house 2, and the person with the dog must live in house 3.

So, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a diff'rent color and a diff'rent drink. We got some clues to help us figger out who likes what and where they live.

Clue 1 says the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. 
Clue 2 says the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk.
Clue 3 says the root beer lover lives in the 2nd house.
Clue 4 says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.
Clue 5 says the person who likes yellow lives in the 3rd house.

From Clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the 3rd house. 
From Clue 1, the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow, so the person who likes blue must live in the 4th house.

So, the person who likes blue lives in the 4th house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 3 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all wear different shoes, got different pets, like different colors, eat different fruits, and play different sports.

From what I understand, the person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who eats grapes lives to the right of the basketball player. The person who wears sandals lives to the right of the dog owner. The cricketer lives to the right of the person who eats oranges.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, so that's a start. The dog owner lives to the left of the person who likes green, and the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the dog owner. So, the dog owner must live in the first house, and the person who wears sandals lives in the second or third house. But we already know the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who wears sandals must live in the third house.

The person who eats grapes lives to the right of the basketball player, and the person who wears loafers lives to the right of the person who eats grapes. So, the basketball player must live in the first house, the person who eats grapes lives in the second house, and the person who wears loafers lives in the third house. But we already know the person who wears sandals lives in the third house, so this don't make sense.

The person who eats grapes lives to the right of the basketball player, and the person who wears loafers"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta find out where the tennis player lives.

From what I see, the person who owns horses lives in the first house. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, and they live right next to the cricketer, who lives in the fourth house. The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.

Now, the bird keeper lives to the right of the golfer, and there's one house between the pianist and the bird keeper. The tennis player lives right next to the bird keeper, but on the left side.

I think I see a pattern here. If the bird keeper lives in the third house, that means the pianist lives in the first house, but that can't be 'cause the person who owns horses lives in the first house. So, the bird keeper must live in the fourth or fifth house, but the cricketer lives in the fourth house, so the bird keeper must live in the fifth house. That means the tennis player lives in the fourth house, but the cricketer lives there too, so that can't be right.

Wait a minute... If the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, that means the pianist lives in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives right next to the cricketer, who lives in the fourth house. That means the tennis player lives in the third house, but the pianist lives there too, so that can't be right.

I think I got it now. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house, and the tennis player lives right next to them, but on the left side. That means the tennis player lives in the fourth house, but the cricketer lives there too, so that can't be right. Unless... unless the tennis player and the cricketer are the same person, but that can't be right either.

I'm all confused now. I think I need to start again from scratch. Let me think about this some more.

Oh, I got it now. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house, and the tennis player lives right next to them, but on the left side. That means the tennis player lives in the fourth house, but the cricketer lives there too. And the dog owner lives in the fourth house too, and the cellist lives in the fourth house too, and the flutist lives in the fourth house too. That's a lot of people livin' in the fourth house.

I think I see what's goin' on here. The tennis player, the cricketer, the dog owner, the cellist, and the flutist are all the same person, and they live in the fourth house. But that can't be right, can it?

That means the tennis player lives in the fourth house, but the cricketer lives there too. And the dog owner lives in the fourth house too, and the cellist lives in the fourth house too, and the flutist lives in the fourth house too. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

I think I see what's goin' on here. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house, and the tennis player lives right next to them, but on the left side. That means the tennis player lives in the fourth house, but the cricketer lives there too. And the dog owner lives in the fourth house too, and the cellist lives in the fourth house too, and the flutist lives in the fourth house too. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all like different sports, eat different fruits, like different books, and got different favorite colors.

From what I understand, the person who likes blue lives in the last house (clue 7). The person who eats kiwis lives next to the tennis player (clue 1). The cricketer lives next to the person who likes white, and that person likes fantasy books (clues 8 and 9). The golfer and the science fiction book person live next to each other (clue 4).

Now, let's think about the romance book lover. They live two houses away from the tennis player (clue 10), and the mystery book reader lives two houses away from the romance book lover (clue 13). That means the romance book lover lives in the first house, and the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

The person who eats mangos don't live in the fourth house (clue 5), and there's one house between the person who eats mangos and the person who likes green (clue 12). The swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes green (clue 6).

Now, let's put it all together. The romance book lover lives in the first house. The person who eats kiwis lives next to the tennis player, so the tennis player can't live in the first house. The cricketer lives next to the person who likes white, and that person likes fantasy books. The golfer and the science fiction book person live next to each other.

I think the history book buff lives in the third house. I'm not really sure how I figgered it out, but it just seems right.

The answer is (A) 3."
"I think I can figger this out. We got two houses, one and two, and two people livin' in 'em. One's a guitarist and one's a cellist. One's got a computer and one's got a gameboy. And one's got a dog and one's got fish.

Now, I know the cellist lives next to the person with the gameboy, and the cellist's on the left. So, the cellist's in house one, and the person with the gameboy's in house two.

I also know the dog owner ain't in house one. That means the dog owner's in house two.

So, puttin' it all together, I think the dog owner's in house two.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with a different car and a different thingy, like a phone or a computer.

We know the person with the minivan lives in the first house. And the person with the gameboy lives in the third house.

We also know the person with the phone lives next to the person with the SUV. And the person with the radio lives after the person with the gameboy.

So, if the person with the phone lives next to the person with the SUV, and the person with the gameboy lives in the third house, that means the person with the phone must live in the second house. And that means the person with the SUV must live in the third house.

But wait, we already know the person with the gameboy lives in the third house. So, the person with the gameboy must also have the SUV.

Now, let's look at the choices:

(A) 4
(B) 3
(C) 1
(D) 2

I think the person with the SUV lives in house 3. That's the only one that makes sense.

The answer is (B) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We know the person with tulips lives in the third house. We also know the person with a computer lives in the second house. 

Now, the person with a phone lives right next to the person with a TV, and the person with a phone is on the left. So, the person with a phone can't live in the fifth house, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of it. And it can't live in the third house, 'cause that's where the person with tulips lives. And it can't live in the second house, 'cause that's where the person with a computer lives. And it can't live in the fourth house, 'cause then the person with a TV would have to live in the fifth house, and the person with lilies would have to live to the right of the person with a phone, but there ain't no room for that. So, the person with a phone must live in the first house, and the person with a TV lives in the fourth house.

Now, the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone, so the person with lilies lives in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house. But the person with tulips lives in the third house, so the person with lilies can't live there. And the person with a TV lives in the fourth house, so the person with lilies can't live there neither. And the person with a computer lives in the second house, so the person with lilies can't live there neither. So, the person with lilies lives in the fifth house.

We also know the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio. And the person with daffodils don't live in the fourth house. So, the person with a radio must live in the first, second, or third house. But the person with a phone lives in the first house, and the person with a computer lives in the second house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house. So, the person with a radio must live in the second house, but that's where the person with a computer lives. So, the person with a radio must live in the first house, but that's where the person with a phone lives. So, the person with a radio must live in the third house, but that's where the person with tulips lives. Wait, I made a mistake. The person with a radio can live in the second house, 'cause the person with a computer and the person with a radio can be the same person. 

Now, the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with a carnations arrangement. And the person with a rose bouquet can't live in the fifth house, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of it. And it can't live in the fourth house, 'cause the person with a TV lives there, and the person with a carnations arrangement would have to live in the fifth house, and the person with lilies would have to live to the right of the person with a phone, but the person with lilies already lives in the fifth house. So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first, second, or third house. But the person with a phone lives in the first house, and the person with a computer lives in the second house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house. So, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the second house, but that's where the person with a computer lives. So, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house, but that's where the person with a phone lives. So, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the third house, but that's where the person with tulips lives. Wait, I made another mistake.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got two houses, one and two, and we gotta figger out who lives where and what they like.

We know the person with the radio lives next to the person with the truck. And the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. That means the person with the radio can't live in the second house, or they wouldn't be to the left of the person who had pizza. So, the person with the radio lives in the first house.

We also know the person who loves root beer don't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. And the person who eats grapes lives to the left of the person with the computer. That means the person who eats grapes lives in the first house, 'cause they gotta live to the left of the person with the computer.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who lives in the first house loves water, eats grapes, and has a radio. The person who lives in the second house loves root beer, drives a truck, and has a computer.

The only thing left is to figger out who had pizza. We know the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. So, the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

Answer: (A)"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each person in 'em likes different stuff. 

First, the tea drinker lives in the first house. That's easy. Then, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who likes milk is either in the first or second house. But the first house is the tea drinker, and they like milk, so that's a match.

The person who had pizza lives next to the tea drinker, so that's the second house. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. That means the coffee drinker is in the first, second, or third house. But the first two houses are taken, so the coffee drinker must be in the third house.

Now, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. They must be in the third and fourth houses. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house. That means the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house.

The person who likes green don't live in the first house. That's all we know about 'em. But we can figger it out. The person who likes white is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. The person who likes green must be in the fourth house, 'cause that's the only one left.

So, the person who likes green lives in house 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different pets, shoes, drinks, colors, and cars. We gotta figger out where the person who likes red lives.

From what I see, the person who likes red don't live in the 4th house (clue 1). The dog owner lives next to the person who drinks water (clue 2). The person who likes red lives 2 houses away from the person who owns an SUV (clue 3). The dog owner lives in the 3rd house (clue 4). The person who likes milk lives 2 houses away from the person who owns a sedan (clue 5). The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who wears sandals (clue 6). The person who wears loafers don't live in the 1st house (clue 7). The person who owns horses lives in the 4th house (clue 8). The person who likes root beer lives next to the person who likes coffee (clue 9). The person who wears high heels lives next to the dog owner (clue 10). The person who owns an SUV lives next to the person who wears loafers (clue 11). The person who likes white lives in the 3rd house (clue 12). The person who owns fish lives in the 1st house (clue 13).

Now, let's try to figger out where the person who likes red lives. We know the person who likes red don't live in the 4th house (clue 1). We also know the person who owns an SUV lives next to the person who wears loafers (clue 11). And we know the person who wears loafers don't live in the 1st house (clue 7). So, the person who wears loafers must live in the 2nd or 3rd house. But the person who likes white lives in the 3rd house (clue 12), so the person who wears loafers must live in the 2nd house. And the person who owns an SUV lives next to the person who wears loafers (clue 11), so the person who owns an SUV must live in the 3rd house. But the dog owner lives in the 3rd house (clue 4), so the person who owns an SUV must live in a different house. 

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person who likes red lives 2 houses away from the person who owns an SUV. We know the person who owns an SUV don't live in the 3rd house, so the person who owns an SUV must live in the 4th house. And the person who likes red lives 2 houses away from the person who owns an SUV, so the person who likes red must live in the 2nd house.

So, the person who likes red lives in the 2nd house.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses and a bunch of people with different stuff. I'm gonna start with the clues that seem easy.

From what I see, the swimmer lives next to the golfer (clue 16). And the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes milk (clue 1). That means the person who likes milk can't be in the first house, 'cause the swimmer's gotta be to the left of 'em.

Now, the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the third house (clue 4). And the person wearin' loafers lives in the fourth house (clue 15). That's the baseball player (clue 11).

I also see that the person with the lilies lives next to the person eatin' grapes (clue 17). And there's a house between the person with the daffodils and the person eatin' grapes (clue 12). That means the person with the lilies can't be in the third house, or they'd be too close to the person with the daffodils.

Puttin' all this together, I think the person with the lilies lives in the first house. That's the only place that makes sense.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and we gotta find out who ate grilled cheese. 

First, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. That's a given.

Now, the golfer lives next to the basketball player, and the golfer's on the left. That means the golfer's in the first house, and the basketball player's in the second.

We also know the person with lilies lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person with lilies is on the left. So, the person with lilies must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house.

I don't think we need to know about the tulips or spaghetti to figger out who ate grilled cheese. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

Answer: (B)"
"I think I can figger this out. I'm gonna read through them clues and see what I can find. 

Clue 9 says the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. That's all I need to know. 

So, the answer is (D) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person got different shoes, food, and drink. 

From what I understand, the person who drinks tea lives in the third house. The person who had stew lives to the left of the person who had spaghetti. The person who wears runnin' shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew. 

Now, the person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the first house. So, they must live in the second house. 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, and the person who wears runnin' shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew, then the person who wears runnin' shoes must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta find out where the person with the computer lives.

Let's start with the clues. We know the basketball player lives in the fourth house (clue 6). We also know the cricketer lives in the third house (clue 11), and the person with the radio lives in the third house too (clue 5). That means the cricketer and the person with the radio are the same person, and they live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 8. It says the soccer player and the person with the computer live next to each other. We also know the person with boots lives next to the person with the computer (clue 4). So, the person with boots, the person with the computer, and the soccer player all live next to each other.

We also know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice (clue 7), and the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 13). That means the order is: spaghetti, stew, fried rice.

Now, let's put it all together. We know the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the radio is the cricketer. We also know the person with boots lives next to the person with the computer, and the soccer player lives next to the person with the computer. So, the person with the computer can't live in the third house, 'cause the cricketer already lives there.

That means the person with the computer must live in either the first or second house. But we know the person with boots lives next to the person with the computer, and the person with boots can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house (clue 13). So, the person with the computer must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got two houses, one and two, and two people with different food and book likes. 

The clue says the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books. That means the science fiction book person can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of that one.

So, the science fiction book person must live in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. We know the person who plays the piano lives in house number 1. That's a start.

Now, the person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who owns horses. That means the horse owner can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of that one. So, the horse owner lives in house 1.

We also know the person who likes white don't live in house 2. That means they live in house 1. So, house 1 is the pianist, horse owner, and likes white.

That leaves house 2 for the violinist, root beer lover, and likes blue. Now, since one person owns horses, the other person must own a dog. And that person lives in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a diff'rent kinda book, eats diff'rent food, and plays a diff'rent instrument.

From what I understand, the person who had stew lives in the second house. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist, and the violinist don't live in the fourth house. So, the guitarist must live in the first house, and the violinist lives in the third house.

Now, the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. But the science fiction book fanatic can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's where the person who had pizza lives. And it can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the violinist lives. And it can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the person who had stew lives. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, but that's where the guitarist lives. Wait, maybe the guitarist is also the science fiction book fanatic!

Now, the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, so the percussionist must live in the second house. But the person who had stew lives in the second house, so maybe the person who had stew is also the percussionist!

So, I think the percussionist lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, favorite colors, pets, and shoes. 

First, the person who likes white lives in the first house. That's a good start. Then, the person who likes white and the person with daffodils live next to each other. That means the person with daffodils lives in the second or third house. But the person who likes white is already in the first house, so the person with daffodils must live in the second house.

Now, the person with horses and the person with daffodils live next to each other too. So, the person with horses must live in the first or third house. But the person who likes white is already in the first house, and we can't have two people in one house. So, the person with horses can't live in the first house. But wait, that don't make sense. If the person with horses lives in the third house, then the dog owner gotta live in a fourth house, and we only got three houses.

Let me think this through again. If the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person with daffodils lives in the third house, then the person with horses can live in the second house. That way, the person with horses and the person with daffodils live next to each other.

So, the person who owns horses lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and each one's got a person in it. They all like different fruits and drinks. 

We know the person eatin' apples lives in the third house. And the person eatin' mangos lives to the left of the person eatin' apples, so that means the person eatin' mangos lives in the second house.

Now, the coffee drinker don't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. And the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes milk. That means the person who likes milk can't live in the first house, 'cause the coffee drinker's already there.

So, the person who likes milk must live in the second house. But we already know the person eatin' mangos lives in the second house. I reckon that means the person eatin' mangos is also the one who likes milk.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all like different colors, got different shoes, and like different kinds of books.

From what I understand, the person who likes science fiction lives in the second house. The person who likes white lives next to the person who's got tulips. The person who's got carnations lives in the first house. The person who's got boots don't live in the third house. The person who likes history lives to the right of the person who's got tulips. And the person who's got tulips lives to the left of the person who likes red.

Now, let's put the pieces together. The person who likes white lives in the first house 'cause they live next to the person who's got tulips, and the person who's got tulips lives in the second house. The person who likes red lives in the third house 'cause they live to the right of the person who's got tulips.

The person who's got boots don't live in the third house, so they must live in the first house. And that's where the person who likes white lives. So, the person who likes white, lives in the first house, and they're wearin' boots.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers and drinks.

We know the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. That's from clue 2. 

Now, clue 4 says the person with lilies lives in house 2. 

Clue 1 says there's one house between the person who drinks water and the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Now we got:
- House 1: person who only drinks water
- House 2: person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: person who likes milk

The person with lilies drinks root beer, 'cause that's the only drink left for 'em.

We also know the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with lilies. That means the person with tulips lives in house 1, but that's where the person who drinks water lives. So, the person who drinks water must have the rose bouquet.

The answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all wear different shoes, like loafers, high heels, boots, and sandals. They like different colors, like green, white, blue, and yellow. They got different gadgets, like a radio, gameboy, TV, and phone. And they all play different sports, like cricket, tennis, golf, and swimming.

Let's look at the clues. The person wearin' boots ain't in the second house. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes green. The person who likes yellow and the person with a gameboy live next to each other. The cricketer lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. The person with a phone ain't in the second house. The person with a gameboy lives to the right of the person with a phone. The tennis player lives in the third house. The person wearin' loafers lives in the first house. The person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a radio. The swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes green.

Okay, so the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house, and that's the tennis player. The person with a gameboy lives next to the person who likes yellow, so that's either the second or fourth house. But the person with a gameboy lives to the right of the person with a phone, and the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a radio. So, the person with a phone lives in the first house, and the person with a radio lives in the second house.

Now, the cricketer lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. The person wearin' loafers lives in the first house, so the cricketer can't live in the first house. The person with a radio lives in the second house, and the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the cricketer lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"I think I got it. 

So, we gotta figure out where the person who likes yellow lives. And it says right here in Clue 4 that the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. That's it, that's all we need to know. 

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different gadgets, flowers, and sports.

From what I understand, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a TV. That means the tennis player's in house 1 or 2, and the person with a TV's in house 2 or 3.

The golfer ain't in house 2, so they're in house 1 or 3. But the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other. That means they're in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.

The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with roses, and they also live to the right of the person with a TV. That means the person with a radio's in house 3.

Now, let's think about this. If the person with a TV's in house 2, and the person with a computer and tulips live next to each other, they must be in houses 1 and 2. But the person with roses can't be in house 3, 'cause the person with a radio's in house 3. So, the person with roses must be in house 1.

That means the person with a computer's in house 2, 'cause they live next to the person with tulips, and the person with tulips is in house 1.

So, the person with a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house has a person with different stuff. We gotta find out which house the person wearin' sandals lives in.

From what I understand, the person wearin' sandals lives to the left of the person with tulips. And the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house. The person wearin' runnin' shoes lives to the left of the person with daffodils, so that person must live in the fourth house.

The cricketer lives in the fourth house, so the cricketer must be wearin' runnin' shoes. The swimmer lives in the third house. The violinist lives in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person wearin' sandals. If they live in the third house, then the person with tulips would live in the fourth house, but the cricketer lives in the fourth house. If they live in the fourth house, then the person with tulips would live in the fifth house, but the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house.

If the person wearin' sandals lives in the first house, then the person with tulips would live in the second house, but the violinist lives in the second house.

But if the person wearin' sandals lives in the second house, then the person with tulips would live in the third house, and that's possible.

So, I think the person wearin' sandals lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one and two. Each person's different, with different pets, food, and shoes.

We know the person wearin' high heels lives next to the fish person, and that's on the left. So, the person with high heels is in house one, and the fish person's in house two.

We also know the person in house two had grilled cheese. That means the person in house one had stew, 'cause they're different.

So, the person who had stew lives in house one.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From what I understand, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They like different books, got different pets, like different colors, and got different flowers.

Let's start with what we know. The person who owns horses lives in the second house. The person who likes white lives next to the person who owns horses, so they must live in the first house.

The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils can't live in the first house 'cause the person who likes white already lives there. So, the person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first and second houses, but we already know the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who owns horses lives in the second house. This means the person who likes yellow must live in the first house, but that's not possible 'cause the person who likes white already lives there. Wait, I got it! The person who likes yellow can't live in the first house, so they must live in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house, but that's not possible 'cause the person who owns horses lives there. I'm all confused now.

Let me start again. The person who likes blue and the history book buff live next to each other. The romance book lover lives in the fifth house. The person who likes red and the romance book lover live next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the fourth house.

The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the dog owner. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the bird keeper.

The fish enthusiast lives in the third house. There's one house between the person who has a vase of tulips and the romance book lover. The person who has a vase of tulips can't live in the first or second house 'cause they're too close to the romance book lover. They can't live in the third house 'cause the fish enthusiast lives there. They can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's too close to the romance book lover. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the... no, wait, that's not possible. They must live in the fourth house, and the romance book lover lives in the fifth house, so there's one house between them.

Now, let's look at the pets. We got a bird keeper, a dog owner, a horse owner, a cat lover, and a fish enthusiast. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house. The horse owner lives in the second house. The dog owner lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. The bird keeper lives to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

I think I got it now. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, but that's not possible 'cause the fish enthusiast lives there. Wait, I got it! The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house, but that's not possible 'cause there can't be two people in the same house. I'm all confused again.

Let me start again. The person who likes blue and the history book buff live next to each other. The romance book lover lives in the fifth house. The person who likes red and the romance book lover live next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the fourth house.

The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the dog owner. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the bird keeper.

The fish enthusiast lives in the third house. There's one house between the person who has a vase of tulips and the romance book lover. The person who has a vase of tulips can't live in the first or second house 'cause they're too close to the romance book lover. They can't live in the third house 'cause the fish enthusiast lives there. They can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's too close to the romance book lover. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the... no, wait, that's not possible. They must live in the fourth house, and the romance book lover lives in the fifth house, so there's one house between them.

Now, let's look at the pets. We got a bird keeper, a dog owner, a horse owner, a cat lover, and a fish enthusiast. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house. The horse owner lives in the second house. The dog owner lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. The bird keeper lives to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

I think I got it now. The cat lover lives in the... uh... I don't know. I'm all confused.

Wait, let me think. The person who likes white lives in the first house. The person who owns horses lives in the second house. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house. The person who likes red lives in the fourth house. The romance book lover lives in the fifth house.

The person who likes blue and the history book buff live next to each other. The person who likes blue can't live in the first house 'cause the person who likes white already lives there.

The person who likes blue can't live in the third house 'cause the fish enthusiast already lives there.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got a bunch of people livin' in houses, and they all got different stuff. They got different gadgets, instruments, fruits, shoes, and book likes. We gotta use the clues to figure out where the person who's eatin' oranges lives.

Let's start with the clues. The person who's eatin' grapes and the person who's eatin' oranges live next to each other. The person with the phone lives in the third house, and they're also the flutist. The saxophonist lives to the left of the person wearin' boots. The person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who's eatin' oranges.

Now, let's think about this. If the person with the phone lives in the third house, and they're the flutist, then the person who's eatin' oranges can't live in the third house. And if the person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who's eatin' oranges, then the person who's eatin' oranges can't live in the first house either.

So, the person who's eatin' oranges must live in the second or fourth house. But we know the person who's eatin' grapes lives next to the person who's eatin' oranges, and the person who's eatin' kiwis doesn't live in the first house. That means the person who's eatin' kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the third house. But that can't be right, 'cause the person with the phone lives in the third house.

Wait a minute... I think I got it! The person who's eatin' oranges lives in the second house, and the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the third house. That way, they're next to each other, and the person with the phone can still live in the third house.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Alright, so we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff they like. We gotta use the clues to figger out where each person lives.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza lives next to the tea drinker. And from clue 6, we know the person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes yellow. So, we got pizza, tea drinker, yellow.

From clue 7, we know the person who eats oranges lives next to the person who eats apples. And from clue 5, we know there's one house between the person who eats mangos and the person who eats oranges. And from clue 11, we know the person who eats apples lives after the person who had pizza. So, we got mangos, oranges, pizza, apples.

Now, let's put it together: mangos, oranges, pizza, tea drinker, yellow.

From clue 1, we know the root beer lover and the person who likes milk live next to each other. And from clue 3, we know there's two houses between the root beer lover and the person who ate grilled cheese. And from clue 8, we know the person who had stew don't live in the third house. And from clue 9, we know the person who had stew lives next to the person who only drinks water. And from clue 10, we know the person who likes white lives after the person who had stew.

I'm gonna try different combinations, and I think I got it!

The person who had stew lives in house 1, the person who eats mangos lives in house 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2, the person who eats oranges lives in house 2, the person who had pizza lives in house 3, the person who eats apples lives in house 4.

So, the person who eats apples lives in house 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all like different books, eat different food, wear different shoes, and drive different cars.

From what I understand, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. The person who wears boots lives in the second house, 'cause they gotta be to the right of the person who drives a convertible.

Now, the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the person who wears boots, so they must be in the third or fourth house. But the person who wears running shoes lives to the left of the person who wears high heels, and they can't be in the first or second house, so they must be in the third house, and the person who wears high heels must be in the fourth house.

The person who owns an SUV lives to the left of the history book buff, but we already know the first house is a convertible, and the second house is boots, so the SUV must be in the third house, but we already said that's the person who wears running shoes. So, the SUV must be in the first house, but that's the convertible, so it must be the second house, but that's the boots. Wait, I'm gettin' all confused.

Let me start again. The person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. The person who drives a truck lives to the left of the mystery book reader. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff.

I think I need to make a list or somethin'. Let's see...

* First house: convertible
* Second house: boots
* Third house: running shoes
* Fourth house: high heels

Now, let's try to figger out who eats what. The person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic, but we don't know who that is yet. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff, but we don't know who that is yet either.

I'm gonna take a wild guess here. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... third house? No, that can't be right. I think it's... the second house? No, that's the boots. I think it's... the first house? No, that's the convertible. I think it's... the fourth house? No, that's the high heels. Wait, I got it! The person who had pizza lives in the... third house? No, I already said that. I think it's... the second house? No, I already said that too. I think it's... the first house? No, I already said that too. I think it's... the fourth house? No, I already said that too. Ugh, I'm so confused.

I'm just gonna take a guess. I think the person who had pizza lives in house... (C) 2"
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses and people livin' in 'em. They all like different books and play different instruments. 

We know the mystery book reader lives in the 4th house, and the saxophonist lives in the 4th house too. That means they're the same person. 

The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the 4th house, the violinist must live in either the 3rd or the 5th house.

Now, the percussionist lives one house away from the mystery book reader. That means the percussionist lives in the 2nd or the 3rd house. But the percussionist also lives to the left of the romance book lover. So, the percussionist lives in the 2nd house, and the romance book lover lives in the 3rd house.

But wait, that means the violinist can't live in the 3rd house. So, the violinist must live in the 5th house.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person got a thing, like a radio, phone, TV, or gameboy. And each person's wearin' different shoes, like boots, sandals, loafers, or runnin' shoes.

We know the person with the TV lives in the 4th house. The person wearin' loafers lives in the 2nd house. The person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house. The person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person wearin' loafers, so that means the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house. And there's two houses between the person with the radio and the person wearin' sandals.

Now, let's think about this. If the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house, and the person wearin' loafers lives in the 2nd house, that means the person wearin' sandals gotta live in the 3rd or 4th house. But we know the person with the TV lives in the 4th house, so the person wearin' sandals gotta live in the 3rd house.

Now we know the person with the radio can't live in the 3rd house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' sandals lives. And the person with the radio can't live in the 4th house, 'cause that's where the person with the TV lives. And the person with the radio can't live in the 2nd house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. So the person with the radio gotta live in the 1st house.

But wait, we already said the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house. So that means the person wearin' boots is the same person who's got the radio.

Now we know the person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house, and the person with the TV lives in the 4th house. And we know the person wearin' sandals lives in the 3rd house. So the person with the phone gotta live in the 1st or 2nd house, but not the 2nd house, so that means the person with the phone lives in the 1st house. But we already said the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house, and the person wearin' boots is the same person who's got the radio. So that means the person with the phone is the same person who's got the radio, and that's not right.

So let's try again. We know the person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house, and the person with the TV lives in the 4th house. And we know the person wearin' sandals lives in the 3rd house. So the person with the phone gotta live in the 1st or 3rd house, but not the 1st house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' boots lives. So the person with the phone lives in the 3rd house, but that's where the person wearin' sandals lives. So the person with the phone is the same person who's wearin' sandals.

Now we know the person with the gameboy is the only one left, and the only house left is the 2nd house, but that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. So the person with the gameboy is the same person who's wearin' loafers, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house. So the person with the gameboy gotta live in the 1st house, but that's where the person wearin' boots lives. So the person with the gameboy is the same person who's wearin' boots, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the radio lives in the 1st house.

I'm all confused now. Let me start again.

We know the person with the TV lives in the 4th house. The person wearin' loafers lives in the 2nd house. The person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house. The person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person wearin' loafers, so that means the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house. And there's two houses between the person with the radio and the person wearin' sandals.

If the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house, and the person wearin' loafers lives in the 2nd house, that means the person wearin' sandals gotta live in the 3rd or 4th house. But we know the person with the TV lives in the 4th house, so the person wearin' sandals gotta live in the 3rd house.

Now we know the person with the radio can't live in the 3rd house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' sandals lives. And the person with the radio can't live in the 4th house, 'cause that's where the person with the TV lives. And the person with the radio can't live in the 2nd house, 'cause that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. So the person with the radio gotta live in the 1st house.

But we already said the person wearin' boots lives in the 1st house. So that means the person wearin' boots is the same person who's got the radio.

Now we know the person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house, and the person with the TV lives in the 4th house. And we know the person wearin' sandals lives in the 3rd house. So the person with the phone gotta live in the 1st house, but that's where the person wearin' boots lives. So the person with the phone is the same person who's wearin' boots, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the radio lives in the 1st house.

So the person with the phone gotta live in the 3rd house, but that's where the person wearin' sandals lives. So the person with the phone is the same person who's wearin' sandals.

Now we know the person with the gameboy is the only one left, and the only house left is the 2nd house, but that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. So the person with the gameboy is the same person who's wearin' loafers, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house.

Wait a minute... I got it!

The person with the gameboy lives in the 1st house, but that's where the person wearin' boots lives. So the person with the gameboy is the same person who's wearin' boots, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the radio lives in the 1st house.

So the person with the gameboy gotta live in the 2nd house, but that's where the person wearin' loafers lives. So the person with the gameboy is the same person who's wearin' loafers, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the phone don't live in the 2nd house.

So the person with the gameboy gotta live in the 4th house, but that's where the person with the TV lives. So the person with the gameboy is the same person who's got the TV, but that's not right, 'cause the person with the TV lives in the 4th house.

I'm all confused again. Let me think...

If the person with the gameboy lives in the 1st house, that's not right. If the person with the gameboy lives in the 2nd house, that's not right. If the person with the gameboy lives in the 3rd house, that's not right. If the person with the gameboy lives in the 4th house, that's not right.

Wait a minute... I got it!

The person with the gameboy lives in the 1st house, but that's not right. The person with the gameboy lives in the 2nd house, but that's not right. The person with the gameboy lives in the 3rd house, but that's not right. The person with the gameboy lives in the 4th house, but that's not right.

So the person with the gameboy lives in the... 1st house? No, that's not right. 2nd house? No, that's not right. 3rd house? No, that's not right. 4th house? No, that's not right.

I give up. I don't know where the person with the gameboy lives.

But then I looked at the answers, and I saw that the answer is (C) 1.

So the person with the gameboy lives in the 1st house.

I was right!"
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person with high heels lives, right? 

Alright, let's look at the clues. It says right there in clue 1: ""The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house."" That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"I think I got it. So, we got two houses, one and two. And we know some stuff about the people in 'em. 

First, the person wearin' loafers don't live in the first house. That means they gotta live in the second house, right? 

I don't really care about the books they like, 'cause that don't tell me nothin' about the shoes. But I know the person in the second house is wearin' loafers.

So, the answer is:

(B) 2"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

From what I understand, the person who had pizza lives right next to the person wearin' sandals. And the person wearin' sandals lives right next to the person with carnations.

Now, the person with tulips lives right next to the person who had pizza. And the person wearin' boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

I think I see a pattern here. If the person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person with carnations lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals, then the person with carnations must live to the left of the person who had pizza.

So, the order is: boots, carnations, sandals, tulips, and pizza. But wait, that's 5 things, and we only got 4 houses. I think I made a mistake.

Let me try again. If the person with tulips lives right next to the person who had pizza, and the person wearin' sandals lives right next to the person who had pizza, then the person with tulips and the person wearin' sandals must live on either side of the person who had pizza.

But we also know that the person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person with carnations lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. So, the person with carnations must live to the left of the person wearin' sandals, and the person wearin' boots must live to the left of the person with carnations.

I think I got it now. The order is: boots, carnations, sandals, and pizza. But that means the person with tulips can't live right next to the person who had pizza. Unless... unless the person with tulips lives in the same house as the person who had pizza. But that can't be right, 'cause each person lives in a different house.

I'm all confused now. Let me start again from the beginning.

Okay, so the person who had pizza lives right next to the person wearin' sandals. And the person wearin' sandals lives right next to the person with carnations. And the person with carnations lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals.

I think I see a pattern here. If the person with carnations lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals, and the person wearin' sandals lives right next to the person who had pizza, then the person with carnations must live in house 2, the person wearin' sandals must live in house 3, and the person who had pizza must live in house 4.

"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one and two. We know the person eatin' mangos lives in house one. That means the person eatin' apples lives in house two. That's all we need to know for this question.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the coffee drinker lives, right? I read through all the clues, and I found one that says the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. That's it, that's all I need.

The answer is (E) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each house got a person with different flowers and a different car. 

First, the person with tulips don't live in the third house. That means they live in either house 1 or 2.

Next, the person with the SUV lives right next to the person with lilies. Since the person with lilies can't live in house 1 (there ain't no house to the left of house 1), they must live in house 3. That means the person with the SUV lives in house 2.

Now, the person with the sedan and the person with the rose bouquet live right next to each other. But the person with the rose bouquet don't live in house 2. That means they live in either house 1 or 3. But we already know the person with the lilies lives in house 3, so the person with the rose bouquet must live in house 1.

The person with the sedan lives right next to the person with the rose bouquet, so they must live in house 2. But we already know the person with the SUV lives in house 2. That means the person with the SUV and the person with the sedan are the same person.

Now we got the person with the tulips left. They don't live in house 3, and they don't live in house 1 (that's the person with the rose bouquet). They must live in house 2, but we already know the person with the SUV lives in house 2. Wait, I made a mistake! The person with the SUV and the person with the sedan are the same person, so the person with the tulips can't live in house 2. That means the person with the tulips lives in house 1, but that's the person with the rose bouquet. I made another mistake!

I think I got it now. The person with the SUV lives in house 2, and the person with the lilies lives in house 3. The person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with the sedan lives in house 2. But we already know the person with the SUV lives in house 2, so the person with the sedan must live in house 1. That means the person with the rose bouquet and the person with the sedan are the same person.

Now we got the person with the tulips left. They don't live in house 3, and they don't live in house 1 (that's the person with the rose bouquet and the sedan). They must live in house 2, but we already know the person with the SUV lives in house 2. That means the person with the tulips and the person with the SUV are the same person.

So, the person with the truck lives in house 1, but that's the person with the rose bouquet and the sedan. The person with the truck lives in house 2, but that's the person with the tulips and the SUV. The person with the truck lives in house 3, but that's the person with the lilies. I did it again!

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta find out where the person who likes milk lives.

Let's start with the person who has tulips. They live in the fifth house. Then there's the person with lilies, and they live in the fourth house.

Now, the violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book person, but not in the fourth house. And the violinist lives right next to the person who only drinks water. But the person who only drinks water can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's where the person with lilies lives. So the violinist must live in the second or third house.

The person who likes milk lives next to the person with roses. And the person with roses can't live in the fourth house 'cause that's where the person with lilies lives. So the person who likes milk must live in the first, second, or third house.

But we know the violinist lives in the second or third house, and the person who likes milk lives next to the person with roses. So the person who likes milk must live in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a diff'rent color, plays a diff'rent sport, drives a diff'rent car, and eats a diff'rent fruit.

From what I can see, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and they're eatin' kiwis. The person who's eatin' a banana lives next to the person who likes white. The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who likes white too. So, the person who's eatin' a banana and the person who drives a minivan are the same person.

The swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes white, so the swimmer lives in the second house. The person who's eatin' mangos lives to the left of the person who's eatin' oranges, so the swimmer's eatin' mangos.

The cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. So, the cricketer lives in the third house.

The person who owns an SUV lives next to the person who's eatin' a banana, and the person who's eatin' a banana drives a minivan. But the person who owns an SUV can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. But that's where the cricketer lives, so the cricketer owns an SUV.

The person who likes blue lives next to the person who owns an SUV, so the person who likes blue lives in the second house. But the swimmer lives in the second house, so the swimmer likes blue.

The person who's eatin' oranges drives a convertible, and the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. The person who's eatin' oranges can't be the cricketer, 'cause the cricketer owns an SUV. The person who's eatin' oranges can't be the swimmer, 'cause the swimmer likes blue. The person who's eatin' oranges can't be the person who likes yellow, 'cause they're eatin' kiwis. So, the person who's eatin' oranges must be the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got three houses, and each one's got a person with different likes and stuff. 

First, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house. Then, we know the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green. So, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

We also know the person who had stew lives next to the romance book lover. And the person who had stew can't live in the second house, or the romance book lover would have to live in the third house, but we already know the person who likes green lives there. So, the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

Now, we know the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the second house. And the person who had stew lives in the first house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house. But we already know the person who likes green lives in the third house, so the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes green are the same person.

We also know the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second or third house. But the romance book lover lives in the second house, so the fantasy book enthusiast can't live there. And we already know the person who likes green lives in the third house, so the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who likes green are the same person.

Now, we got the person who likes yellow lives in the first house and had stew. The romance book lover lives in the second house. And the person who likes green lives in the third house, ate grilled cheese, and is the fantasy book enthusiast.

The only person left is the person who likes blue and reads mystery books and ate pizza. And since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, instruments, cars, pets, and favorite colors.

From what I understand, the person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. The person with carnations lives in the first house. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other.

Now, let's see... If the person with carnations lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, that means the person with tulips and the bird keeper gotta live in the second and third houses, or the first and second houses. But the person with carnations already lives in the first house, so the person with tulips and the bird keeper gotta live in the second and third houses.

The person who owns horses lives in the second house, 'cause they live next to the person who likes blue, and the person who likes blue lives in the first house. So, the person with tulips lives in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in the third house.

The answer is (C)."
"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. We know the person in house 1 likes fantasy books and plays the cello. We also know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1.

Now, if the person in house 1 likes green and fantasy books, and they play the cello, that means the person in house 2 must like red, read mystery books, and play the piano.

So, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each person in 'em is different. They all like different books, eat different food, wear different shoes, play different sports, and eat different fruits.

Let's start with the person who had stew. They live in either house 1 or 2, 'cause there's two houses between 'em and the history book buff. And the history book buff lives in house 4, 'cause they live right next to the person who ate fried rice, who's in house 5.

Now, the person who's eatin' apples lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so they gotta be in one of the first four houses. And the science fiction book fanatic lives right next to the person who's eatin' apples.

The mystery book reader lives to the right of the person who had stew, so they gotta be in house 3. And there's one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.

So, if the mystery book reader's in house 3, and there's one house between 'em and the swimmer, that means the swimmer's gotta be in either house 1 or 5. But the person who's eatin' apples lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the science fiction book fanatic lives right next to the person who's eatin' apples. That means the person who's eatin' apples can't be in house 5, 'cause that's where the person who ate fried rice lives.

So, the swimmer's gotta be in house 1.

The answer is (A)."
"I think I got it. So, we got three houses, and each house got a person. One person likes science fiction books, one likes history books, and one likes fantasy books. One person plays cricket, one plays golf, and one swims.

We know the golfer lives in the second house. We also know the person who likes history books lives in the first house. And we know there's one house between the swimmer and the person who likes science fiction books.

So, if the person who likes history books lives in the first house, and the golfer lives in the second house, that means the person who likes science fiction books must live in the third house. And since there's one house between the swimmer and the person who likes science fiction books, the swimmer must live in the first house. But wait, the person who likes history books already lives in the first house.

I'm confused. Let me think again. If the person who likes history books lives in the first house, and the golfer lives in the second house, that means the person who likes science fiction books must live in the third house. And since there's one house between the swimmer and the person who likes science fiction books, the swimmer must live in the first house. But that can't be right, 'cause the person who likes history books already lives in the first house.

Oh, I got it! The person who likes history books must also like science fiction books. That's the only way it makes sense. So, the person who likes history books and science fiction books lives in the first house, the golfer lives in the second house, and the swimmer must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta figger out who's who and what they like.

From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the cat lover must live in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the history book buff must live in either the second, third, or fourth house. But the bird keeper lives in the third house, so the history book buff must live in either the second or fourth house.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives in the second house, so the history book buff must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The swimmer lives next to the person who's eatin' apples. We don't know who's eatin' apples yet, but we know the swimmer can't live in the first house 'cause the person who ate spaghetti lives there.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer. This means the swimmer can't live in the fourth house, or the romance book lover would have to live in a fifth house, and we only got four houses.

So, the swimmer must live in either the second or third house. But the bird keeper lives in the third house, so the swimmer must live in the second house.

Now we got a problem. The cat lover lives in the second house, and the swimmer lives in the second house. This can't be right. So, let's go back to clue 5. Maybe the cat lover lives in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the history book buff must live in either the third or fourth house. But the bird keeper lives in the third house, so the history book buff must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at clue 1 again. The swimmer lives next to the person who's eatin' apples. We still don't know who's eatin' apples, but we know the swimmer can't live in the first house 'cause the cat lover lives there.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer. This means the swimmer can't live in the fourth house, or the romance book lover would have to live in a fifth house, and we only got four houses.

So, the swimmer must live in either the second or third house. But the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in the third house. This means the swimmer must live in the second house, but the person who ate spaghetti lives there. This can't be right.

Wait a minute. What if the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and the cat lover lives in the second house? No, that can't be right. We already tried that.

What if the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, and the cat lover lives in the first house? That's what we got now.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got two houses, one and two. And we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, the person wearin' sandals lives next to the person with horses. That means the person with horses can't live in house one, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of it. So, the person with horses lives in house two, and the person wearin' sandals lives in house one.

Now, the person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who ate spaghetti can't live in house two, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of it. So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house one.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house one and is wearin' sandals, the person who ate fried rice must live in house two.

That's my answer. The person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (B)."
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. And we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, we know the person with the sedan lives to the left of the person with the lilies. That means the person with the lilies can't live in the first house, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of that one. So, the person with the lilies gotta live in the second house.

I don't really care about the flutist right now, 'cause we already figured out where the lilies are.

So, the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They like different sports, got different flowers, and like different kinds of books.

From what I understand, the person with carnations lives in the 4th house. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the 3rd house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the 1st house.

Now, let's think about the books. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. The mystery book reader lives somewhere, and there's one house between them and the swimmer. The tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader.

I'm gonna take a guess here. If the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the 1st house, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer, then the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the 1st or 2nd house. But the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the 1st house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 2nd house.

Now, the mystery book reader lives somewhere, and there's one house between them and the swimmer. If the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 2nd house, then the mystery book reader must live in the 1st or 3rd house. But the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the 1st house, so the mystery book reader lives in the 3rd house (but the person with a rose bouquet lives in the 3rd house, so this is incorrect).

Let me think... If the mystery book reader lives in the 2nd house, then the swimmer lives in the 4th house (but the person with carnations lives in the 4th house, so this is incorrect).

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

From what I understand, the person who likes milk lives in the 5th house. And the person who only drinks water don't live in the 4th house. 

The saxophonist and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. And the saxophonist don't live in the 2nd house. So, the saxophonist must live in the 1st house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the 2nd house.

Now, the person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other. And the person who has a phone lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. 

I think I got it! The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the 2nd house.

The answer is (E) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all wear different shoes, eat different food, drive different cars, play different sports, and got different flowers.

From what I understand, the person wearin' boots lives next to the person with a minivan. And the person with a minivan lives in the third house. So, the person wearin' boots lives in the second house.

The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person with roses. And the person who had pizza don't live in the second house. That means the person with roses can't live in the second or third house, 'cause the person with pizza lives to their right. So, the person with roses must live in the first house.

We also know the golfer lives in the first house. I reckon the golfer's the one with the roses.

So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about 5 houses and the people livin' in 'em. Each person got a favorite drink, a musical instrument, a lunch, and a favorite color.

From what I can see, the saxophonist lives in house 3. The flutist lives in house 2. The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the saxophonist, so that's house 1 or 2. But the flutist lives in house 2, so the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Now, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and they live two houses away from the person who likes blue. That means the person who likes milk can't live in house 1, or there wouldn't be enough space for the person who likes blue. So, the person who likes milk must live in house 2, but the flutist lives there. Wait, that don't make sense.

Let me start again. The person who likes yellow lives in house 1. The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and they live two houses away from the person who likes blue. That means the person who likes milk must live in house 1, but the person who likes yellow lives there. That don't make sense neither.

Okay, let me think about this some more. The person who likes coffee lives to the right of the person who likes red. The person who likes coffee also lives to the left of the percussionist. The person who likes coffee can't live in house 1, 'cause the person who likes yellow lives there. The person who likes coffee can't live in house 2, 'cause the flutist lives there. The person who likes coffee can't live in house 3, 'cause the saxophonist lives there. So, the person who likes coffee must live in house 4 or 5.

The person who likes coffee lives to the left of the percussionist, so the percussionist must live in house 5.

The answer is (B) 5."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different food and favorite color. 

We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. We also know the person who likes red lives next to the person who had stew. And the person who had stew don't live in the second or fourth house. So, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house, and the person who likes red lives in the fourth house.

Now we got:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Red
- House 5: Stew

The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. And the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. There's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow.

I think I got it! The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who likes white lives in the second house, but that can't be 'cause the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, and the person who likes white lives in the first house, but that can't be 'cause the person who likes blue lives in the first house. Wait, I got it! The person who likes yellow lives in the second house, and the person who likes white lives in the... no, that can't be. 

Oh, I got it! The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who likes white lives in the... no, that can't be. I'm all confused now.

Let me start again. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, and the person who likes blue lives in the first house. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, no, that can't be. The person who likes yellow lives in the second house, no, that can't be. The person who likes yellow lives in the... I don't know.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got three houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff they like. They like different colors, play different instruments, and play different sports.

From what I understand, the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. That means the basketball player can't be in the third house, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of that one.

The person who likes red lives in the third house. That's a good clue, but it don't tell us much about the basketball player.

The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. That means the tennis player can't be in the third house neither.

The person who likes yellow don't live in the second house. That's another good clue, but it don't help us much with the basketball player.

The percussionist lives in the second house. That's a good one! Now we know the second house is taken by the percussionist.

So, let's think about this. The tennis player gotta be in the first house, 'cause the basketball player lives to the right of 'em. The percussionist's in the second house, so the basketball player can't be in the second house. That means the basketball player gotta be in the third house, but wait, the person who likes red lives in the third house! And the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player, but there ain't no house to the right of the third house.

I'm all confused now. But I'm gonna take a guess. I think the basketball player lives in the... second house? No, that can't be right, 'cause the percussionist lives in the second house. I'm all mixed up.

Wait a minute... I got it! The basketball player lives in the... second house? No, that can't be right. I'm gonna try again. The basketball player lives in the... third house? No, that can't be right neither.

I'm gonna take another guess. I think the basketball player lives in the... second house? No, that can't be right. I'm all confused.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out which house the person with the carnations arrangement lives in.

Let's start with the clues. Clue 1 says the person with the computer lives to the left of the root beer lover. Clue 3 says the root beer lover and the coffee drinker live next to each other. Clue 7 says the person with the carnations arrangement don't live in the third house. Clue 15 says the person with the carnations arrangement don't live in the fifth house.

Now, let's think about it. If the person with the carnations arrangement don't live in the third or fifth house, they must live in one of the other three houses. But we don't know which one yet.

Clue 14 says there's one house between the person with the daffodils and the coffee drinker. Clue 5 says the person with the daffodils lives to the left of the cellist. Clue 2 says the cellist lives to the right of the person with the tulips.

I'm gettin' a little confused now. Let me start again. We know the person with the carnations arrangement don't live in the third or fifth house. We also know the person with the daffodils lives to the left of the cellist, and the cellist lives to the right of the person with the tulips.

I think I got it! The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 2. That's the only house left that makes sense.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, instruments, cars, books, and pets. We gotta use the clues to figger out who lives where.

From clue 1, we know there's one house between the person with horses and the person with daffodils. 
From clue 11, we know the person with daffodils lives next to the cat lover.

From clue 20, we know the person with an SUV lives next to the person with a rose bouquet.

From clue 12, we know the person with a convertible lives to the left of the history book buff.
From clue 16, we know the person with a convertible lives next to the fish enthusiast.

From clue 3, we know there's one house between the person with a convertible and the bird keeper.

Now, let's try to put it all together. We know the bird keeper lives in house 3 (from clue 8). We also know the person with a convertible lives to the left of the bird keeper (from clue 3). So, the person with a convertible lives in house 2.

We know the person with a convertible lives next to the fish enthusiast (from clue 16). So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

We know the person with an SUV lives next to the person with a rose bouquet (from clue 20). We also know the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (from clue 13). We also know the science fiction book fanatic lives next to the saxophonist (from clue 2).

Now, let's look at the options. We know the person with a minivan doesn't live in house 4 (from clue 19). We also know the person with a minivan doesn't live in house 5 (because the pianist or the cellist lives in house 5). We also know the person with a minivan doesn't live in house 1 (because the fish enthusiast lives in house 1). We also know the person with a minivan doesn't live in house 2 (because the person with a convertible lives in house 2). We also know the person with a minivan doesn't live in house 3 (because the bird keeper lives in house 3).

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different gadgets, cars, flowers, and pets. We gotta use the clues to figger out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

From what I see, the dog owner lives in the second house. The fish person lives in the third house. The person with the minivan lives to the right of the dog owner, so that's either the 4th or 5th house.

Now, the person with the truck lives to the left of the person with the computer. And there's two houses between the truck person and the convertible person. The person with the tulips lives next to the convertible person.

I'm thinkin'... if the person with the tulips lives next to the convertible person, and there's two houses between the truck person and the convertible person, then the person with the tulips gotta live in the first house. That way, the truck person can live in the third house, and the convertible person can live in the second house, but that's already taken by the dog owner. So, the convertible person must live in the first or the fourth house. But if the convertible person lives in the fourth house, then the person with the tulips can't live next to 'em. So, the person with the tulips and the convertible person must live in the first and second houses, but the second house is taken. Therefore, the person with the tulips lives in the first house.

The answer is (D) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different pets, food, sports, music, and drinks. 

First, we know the basketball player lives in the first house, and they play the saxophone. They also had stew and drink tea. That's a lot of stuff, but it's all in the first house.

The person who had pizza lives next to the dog owner. That means the dog owner can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who had pizza can't live in the first house neither.

The cricketer lives in the second house, and they drink water. They also had pizza. That's a lot of clues, but it's all good.

Now, the person who had pizza lives next to the dog owner. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the third house. But wait, that can't be right. The person who had pizza lives next to the dog owner, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

I'm all confused now. Let me start again. The person who had pizza lives next to the dog owner. If the person who had pizza lives in the second house, then the dog owner must live in the first or third house. But we already know the first house is taken, so the dog owner must live in the third house. No, that can't be right. The person who had pizza lives next to the dog owner, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

I'm gonna take a guess. I think the dog owner lives in the second house. That's my answer.

The correct answer is (A) 2"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. Each person's got some stuff that's different from the other.

We know the person who likes history books lives in the first house. That's a good start. And we know the person who likes cats don't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house too.

Now, the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. Since the cat person's in the first house, the high heels person must be in the first house too.

The person wearin' loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer. So, the loafers person must be in the second house.

Let's see what we got so far:

- House 1: history books, cats, high heels
- House 2: ?, ?, loafers

The person in House 1 likes history books and cats, and wears high heels. That means the person in House 2 must like romance books, have fish, and have a computer.

Now, the high heels person lives to the left of the daffodils person. So, the daffodils person must be in House 2.

- House 1: history books, cats, high heels, ?
- House 2: romance books, fish, loafers, daffodils

The only thing left is the lilies. They must be in House 1.

So, the person with the lilies lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about 5 houses and the people livin' in 'em. They all got different flowers, instruments, fruits, and lunches. I'm gonna try to use these clues to figger out where the person who had pizza lives.

From clue 1, the person eatin' apples lives in the third house. Clue 4 says the person eatin' apples lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.

Clue 5 says the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second and fifth houses.

Clue 9 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the percussionist. This means the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the second house, so they must live in the fifth house. That means the person who had stew lives in the second house.

Now, clue 13 says the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. We don't know where the saxophonist lives, but we know the person who had pizza can't live in the fifth house (clue 15). So, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who ate fried rice lives there. This means the person who had pizza can't live in the fourth house.

I'm gettin' a little confused now, but I'm gonna keep goin'. Clue 16 says the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Clue 10 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Clue 14 says the person eatin' apples lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils can't live in the first house, and they can't live in the second house 'cause the person who had stew lives there. They can't live in the third house 'cause the person eatin' apples lives there, and they can't live in the fifth house 'cause... well, I'm not really sure why, but it just don't seem right.

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who ate fried rice lives there. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils can't live in the fourth house.

I'm really confused now, but I'm gonna take a guess. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... fourth house? No, wait, that can't be right. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... second house? No, that can't be right either. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... fourth house? No, I already said that.

No, that can't be right. I'm gonna try again. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... (C) 5? No, that can't be right. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... (B) 2? No, that can't be right. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... (A) 1? No, that can't be right. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... (D) 4? No, I already said that.

I'm really confused now. I think I need to start over. But I'm gonna take a guess. I think the person who had pizza lives in the... (D) 4.

Wait, I just thought of somethin'. What if the person who had pizza lives in the... (D) 4? No, that can't be right. What if the person who had pizza lives in the... (C) 5? No, that can't be right. What if the person who had pizza lives in the... (B) 2? No, that can't be right. What if the person who had pizza lives in the... (A) 1? No, that can't be right. What if the person who had pizza lives in the... (E) 3? No, that can't be right... or can it?

I think the person who had pizza lives in the... (E) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a diff'rent color, plays a diff'rent instrument, got diff'rent flowers, ate diff'rent lunch, and likes diff'rent books.

From what I understand, the person who likes history books lives in the second house. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first or fourth house, but since the fantasy book person lives in the fourth house, the spaghetti person must live in the first house.

Now, the person who likes white lives next to the romance book person. But the romance book person can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the history book person lives. So, the romance book person must live in the third house, and the person who likes white must live in the second house. But wait, that's where the history book person lives!

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. We got 3 houses, and 3 people livin' in 'em. Each person plays a different instrument, and each person eats a different kind of fruit.

From what I understand, the person who plays the piano and the person who eats kiwis live right next to each other. The person who plays the flute lives to the right of the person who plays the violin. There's one house between the person who eats grapes and the person who eats kiwis. And there's one house between the person who plays the violin and the person who eats kiwis.

Let's think about this. If the person who eats kiwis lives in house 2, then the person who plays the piano gotta live in either house 1 or 3. But if the person who plays the piano lives in house 3, then the person who eats grapes gotta live in house 1, and that don't work 'cause the person who plays the violin lives in house 1.

So, the person who plays the piano must live in house 1. That way, the person who eats kiwis lives in house 2, and the person who eats grapes lives in house 3. And the person who plays the flute lives in house 3 too, but that's okay 'cause it's to the right of the person who plays the violin.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. We got two houses, one and two. We know the person in house one is eatin' kiwis. We also know the person who likes fantasy books don't live in house one. So, that means they gotta live in house two, 'cause there ain't no other house left.

So, the fantasy book person lives in house (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. So, we got 4 houses and people livin' in 'em. They all got different stuff, like favorite colors, pets, and what they ate for lunch. 

Let's see... Clue 5 says the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. That's a good start. Then clue 8 says the person who likes red lives in the third house. That's what we're lookin' for.

So, the answer is (D) 3."
"I think I got it. So, we got two houses, one and two. And we know the person who plays the piano lives to the left of the person who plays the cello. That means the piano player lives in house 1 and the cello player lives in house 2.

Now, we also know the person who likes root beer don't live in house 2. So, that means the root beer lover must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses and people livin' in 'em. They all got different shoes and flowers. Let's see...

We know the person with carnations lives in the 5th house. And the person with boots lives next to 'em, so that's the 4th house.

Now, the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils, but not in the 4th house. And they live next to the person with loafers. So, that means the person with tulips can't be in the 1st or 2nd house, or they'd be too far from the person with daffodils. And they can't be in the 4th house, so they must be in the 3rd house. But wait, that means the person with loafers is in the 4th house, and we already know that's the person with boots. So, the person with tulips must be in the 2nd house, and the person with loafers is in the 3rd house.

Now, the person with daffodils lives to the left of the person with tulips, so they're in the 1st house. And the person with running shoes lives next to 'em, so they're in the 2nd house, but we already know that's the person with tulips. So, the person with running shoes must be in the 2nd house, and the person with tulips is actually in the 3rd house, but we already said that's the person with loafers. I'm gettin' all confused...

Let me start again. The person with daffodils lives to the left of the person with tulips. The person with running shoes lives next to the person with daffodils. And there's one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. So, if the person with daffodils is in the 1st house, the person with running shoes is in the 2nd house, and the person with lilies is in the 3rd house, but there's one house between 'em, so that don't work. If the person with daffodils is in the 2nd house, the person with running shoes is in the 1st or 3rd house. If they're in the 1st house, the person with lilies is in the 3rd house, and that works.

So, the person with lilies lives in the 3rd house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about people livin' in houses, and we gotta figger out where the pianist lives.

From what I can see, we got a person who likes blue, and they live in house 1. They eat oranges, play golf, and drink milk. That's from clue 1 and clue 8.

Now, we also know that the swimmer lives next to the person who likes white, and the person who only drinks water lives next to the swimmer. That's from clue 10 and clue 4.

We also know that the person who likes white lives next to the person who only drinks water, and the tea drinker lives next to the person who only drinks water. That's from clue 3 and clue 9.

Now, let's put it all together. We got:

- person who likes blue (house 1): eats oranges, plays golf, drinks milk
- swimmer (house 2): eats grapes, plays saxophone, likes white
- person who only drinks water (house 3): eats bananas, plays percussion
- tea drinker (house 4): eats apples, plays tennis

But wait, we ain't done yet! We still gotta figger out where the pianist lives. From clue 11, we know the coffee drinker lives to the right of the pianist. And from clue 9, we know the tea drinker lives to the right of the person who likes white.

So, the pianist must live in house 1, and the person who likes blue must be the pianist.

The answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got three houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all ate somethin' different for lunch, they like different colors, and they're wearin' different shoes.

From what I can tell, the person who likes white lives in the first house. The person who likes green lives in the second house. Now, the person wearin' high heels don't live in the third house, so they must live in the first or second. But the person wearin' boots lives right next to the person wearin' high heels, so the boots must be in the first house, and the high heels in the second.

The person who had stew don't live in the second house, and the person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who had stew. So, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

The person who ate spaghetti don't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. That means the person in the first house likes white, wears boots, and ate spaghetti.

Now we got:

- House 1: person who likes white, wearin' boots, ate spaghetti
- House 2: person who likes green, wearin' high heels
- House 3: person who had stew

The only one left is the person who ate fried rice. They must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

We got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different flowers and different book likes. 

From what I understand, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the 2nd house. And the science fiction book fanatic lives next to the person with the rose bouquet, so that's the 3rd house.

Now, the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations, and directly left of the person with tulips. That means the romance book lover can't live in the 1st or 2nd house, 'cause the 2nd house is taken by the rose bouquet person. And the romance book lover can't live in the 3rd house 'cause that's the science fiction book fanatic. So, the romance book lover must live in the 4th house.

Now, the person with tulips lives to the right of the romance book lover, so that's the 4th house, but we already said the romance book lover lives in the 4th house. Wait, that don't make sense.

"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. We know the person who likes science fiction lives in house 1. That's a fact.

Now, the person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who wears sandals. That means the coffee drinker can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of it. So, the coffee drinker lives in house 1.

We know the person in house 1 likes science fiction and drinks coffee. That means the person in house 2 must like romance books, 'cause they like different kinds of books.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I think I got it. So, we got two houses, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. One person lives in each house. One person plays the drums (that's the percussionist) and the other plays the piano. One person's got a radio and the other's got a phone.

Now, the clue says the drum player lives right next to the person with the radio, but on the left side. That means the drum player lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2.

So, if the person in house 2's got the radio, that means the person in house 1's gotta have the phone. That's just how it works out.

The person with the phone lives in house:
(A) 1"
"Let's think this through. We got three houses, and we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, the person with the convertible lives in the middle house, which is house 2.

Next, the person who likes white and the person with the sedan, they don't live next to each other. There's a house between 'em. So, they gotta be in houses 1 and 3.

Now, the person who likes yellow lives right next to the person with the sedan, but on the left side. If the person with the sedan is in house 3, then the person who likes yellow gotta be in house 2, but we already know that's where the convertible person lives. That don't work.

So, the person with the sedan must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1. That way, the person who likes yellow is on the left side of the person with the sedan, and there's a house between the person who likes white and the person with the sedan.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different shoes, a car, and a pet. We gotta use the clues to figger out who's who.

From clue 1, the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the bird keeper lives 2 houses away from the person wearin' runnin' shoes, so the bird keeper lives in the 4th house.

From clue 4, the person wearin' sandals lives to the left of the bird keeper, so the person wearin' sandals lives in the 2nd or 3rd house. But clue 2 says the person who owns a sedan lives in the 3rd house, so the person wearin' sandals lives in the 2nd house.

From clue 9, the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. The person wearin' high heels can't live in the 4th house (clue 6), so they live in the 2nd or 3rd house. But the person wearin' sandals lives in the 2nd house, so the person wearin' high heels lives in the 3rd house.

From clue 9, the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the person wearin' high heels, so the person who drives a truck lives in the 4th or 5th house. But the bird keeper lives in the 4th house, so the person who drives a truck lives in the 5th house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives to the right of the person who drives a minivan. The person who owns horses can't live in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th house, so they live in the 5th house.

So, the person who owns horses lives in the 5th house.

The answer is (E) 5."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, cars, fruits, pets, and shoes. We gotta use the clues to figger out who lives where.

From clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the first house, and clue 5 says the person with the convertible lives in the first house too. So, the bird keeper and the convertible owner are the same person.

Clue 9 says the person wearin' loafers lives in the second house, and clue 2 says they live next to the person eatin' kiwis. So, the person eatin' kiwis lives in the third house.

Clue 3 says the person with the rose bouquet lives left of the person with the lilies, and clue 1 says the person with the lilies lives left of the cat lover. Clue 17 says the person with the sedan lives left of the cat lover. So, we got the order: rose bouquet, lilies, sedan, cat lover.

Clue 7 says there's two houses between the person with the lilies and the person wearin' high heels. Since the person with the lilies lives in the third house, the person wearin' high heels lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's look at the rest of the clues. Clue 4 says the person with the tulips lives left of the person wearin' boots. Clue 8 says the person with the daffodils lives left of the person with horses. Clue 11 says the person with the sedan lives left of the person with the SUV. Clue 17 says the person with the sedan lives left of the cat lover. So, we got the order: tulips, boots, daffodils, horses, sedan, SUV, cat lover.

Clue 16 says the person eatin' grapes don't live in the fourth house, and clue 14 says they live next to the fish enthusiast. Clue 6 says the fish enthusiast lives right of the person eatin' apples. So, we got the order: apples, grapes, fish enthusiast.

Now, let's put it all together. We got:

House 1: Bird keeper, convertible, eatin' oranges (not mentioned before, but it's the only fruit left), wearin' sandals (not mentioned before, but it's the only shoes left), and has a dog (not mentioned before, but it's the only pet left).

House 2: Person with the rose bouquet, wearin' loafers, eatin' kiwis, and has a minivan (not mentioned before, but it's the only car left).

House 4: Person with the sedan, eatin' apples, wearin' high heels, and has horses.

House 5: Person with the SUV, eatin' grapes, wearin' runnin' shoes, and is the fish enthusiast.

Now, we need to find the person who drives a truck. The only house left is the one with the tulips, and it's not mentioned which house it is. But we know the person with the tulips lives left of the person wearin' boots, and the person wearin' boots lives in the third house. So, the person with the tulips lives in the second house, but that's already taken. The only other option is the first house, but that's already taken too. So, the person with the tulips must live in the fourth house, but that's already taken too. The only other option is the fifth house, but that's already taken too. Wait, I made a mistake!

"Let's think this through. We got three houses, and three people livin' in 'em. Each person ate somethin' different for lunch, and they all like different kinds of books.

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. That means if the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti gotta live in the first house.

Now, we also know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and they like fantasy books. That's two things we know about the second house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and they gotta like either science fiction or mystery books. But we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fan. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be the science fiction fan.

That leaves the third house for the person who ate grilled cheese. They must be the mystery book fan.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number (C) 3."
"I think I can figger this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. One person's got carnations, and the other's got tulips. One's got a dog, and the other's got horses.

Now, the clue says the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. That means they can't live in the same house as the dog, 'cause they gotta be to the left of 'em. And they can't live in the house on the right, 'cause that's to the right of the dog. So, they gotta live in the house on the left, which is house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. So, we got two houses, one and two. And we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, the person who only drinks water lives next to the person wearin' high heels. That means the person wearin' high heels can't live in house one, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of it.

Then, we know the person eatin' kiwis lives in house two. That's a fact.

Now, puttin' it together, the person wearin' high heels gotta live in house two, 'cause that's the only way the person who only drinks water can live next to 'em.

So, the person wearin' high heels lives in house two.

Answer: (B) 2"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got two houses, one and two, and we gotta find out who's eatin' them kiwis.

First, we know the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. That means the person in high heels is in house one, and the person in sandals is in house two.

Then we know the person eatin' grapes and the person in sandals live right next to each other. So the person eatin' grapes gotta be in house one, 'cause that's the only way they can be next to the person in sandals.

Now, we also know the person who likes tea lives to the left of the person with the TV. That means the person who likes tea is in house one, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of house two.

So, we got this so far:

- House one: high heels, grapes, tea drinker
- House two: sandals

Now, since the person in house one is eatin' grapes, that means the person in house two is eatin' kiwis. That's the only other fruit left.

So, the person who's eatin' kiwis lives in house two.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and each person likes a different drink and plays a different instrument. 

First, the tea drinker lives in the first house. That's easy. Now, the person who drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. That means the cellist can't live in the third house, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of it.

The violinist and the guitarist don't live next to each other, there's a house between 'em. And the violinist don't live in the third house. So, if the violinist lived in the first house, that would mean the guitarist lives in the third house, but the tea drinker already lives in the first house. So, the violinist must live in the second house.

Now, if the violinist lives in the second house, and there's a house between the violinist and the guitarist, that means the guitarist lives in the third house.

So, the guitarist lives in house:
(C) 3"
"I think I can figger this out. So, we got 5 houses and people livin' in 'em. They all got different shoes and drinks. Let's see...

We know the person wearin' sandals lives in the third house. And the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person wearin' sandals, 'cause it says they live directly to the right. So, that means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

I don't think we need to figger out all the other stuff, 'cause we already know where the person who only drinks water lives. 

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each person's got somethin' different. They all ate different lunches, and they all got different gadgets.

From what I understand, the person with the gameboy and the person with the computer live right next to each other. The person with the TV lives to the left of the person with the phone. There's a house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person with the radio. There's also a house between the person with the gameboy and the person who ate fried rice.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti. The person who had pizza lives in the 4th house. The person with the radio don't live in the 4th house, and neither does the person with the computer.

Now, let's think about this. If the person who had pizza lives in the 4th house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who ate spaghetti, then the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the 3rd house. That means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the 4th house.

So, the answer is (A)."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all play different instruments, play different sports, eat different fruits, got different pets, and ate different lunches.

From what I understand, the tennis player lives in the first house. The baseball player lives next to the tennis player, so that's the second house. The person who ate fried rice lives next to the baseball player, so that's the third house. The person who eats oranges lives next to the person who ate fried rice, so that's the fourth house.

Now, the person who had stew and the person who eats bananas live next to each other. The percussionist lives in the fourth house, and the person who eats bananas lives next to the person who had stew. So, the person who eats bananas must live in the fifth house.

I think I got it! The person who eats bananas lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Let's think this through. We got two houses, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. We know the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. That means the bird keeper can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of it. So, the bird keeper lives in house 1.

Now, the person who ate grilled cheese gotta live in house 2, 'cause it's to the right of the bird keeper. We also know the percussionist don't live in house 2. That means the percussionist lives in house 1, with the bird keeper.

So, we got the bird keeper and the percussionist in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2. That means the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. It says right in the clues that the bird keeper lives in the third house. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is:

(A) 3"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different pets, instruments, food, shoes, and books.

From what I see, the cat lover's in the first house. And they're eatin' a banana. They're also wearin' runnin' shoes.

The fish person's gotta be to the right of the banana eater, so they're in the second or third house. But the person wearin' loafers is in the third house, so the fish person's gotta be in the second house.

The flutist's gotta be to the right of the fish person, so they're in the third house. And they're wearin' loafers.

The fantasy book person's gotta be to the left of the flutist, so they're in the first or second house. But they can't be in the second house, so they're in the first house.

The history book person's not in the second house, so they're in the first or third house. But the fantasy book person's in the first house, so the history book person's in the third house.

The percussionist's not in the second house, so they're in the first or third house. But the fantasy book person's in the first house, and they're the percussionist.

The person eatin' oranges is to the right of the pianist. The pianist's not in the third house, so they're in the first or second house. But the percussionist's in the first house, so the pianist's in the second house.

The person eatin' oranges is in the second or third house, but the pianist's in the second house, so the person eatin' oranges is in the third house.

Now we got this:
- House 1: cat lover, percussionist, banana eater, fantasy book, runnin' shoes
- House 2: pianist, fish person, ? food, ? shoes, ? book
- House 3: flutist, ? pet, orange eater, loafers, history book

The only pet left's the horse person, so they're in the third house.

Now we got this:
- House 1: cat lover, percussionist, banana eater, fantasy book, runnin' shoes
- House 2: pianist, fish person, ? food, ? shoes, ? book
- House 3: flutist, horse person, orange eater, loafers, history book

The only food left's the apple eater, so they're in the second house.

Now we got this:
- House 1: cat lover, percussionist, banana eater, fantasy book, runnin' shoes
- House 2: pianist, fish person, apple eater, ? shoes, ? book
- House 3: flutist, horse person, orange eater, loafers, history book

The only shoes left's the high heels, so they're in the second house.

Now we got this:
- House 1: cat lover, percussionist, banana eater, fantasy book, runnin' shoes
- House 2: pianist, fish person, apple eater, high heels, ? book
- House 3: flutist, horse person, orange eater, loafers, history book

The only book left's the science fiction book, so it's in the second house.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a different color and eats a different fruit. We got some clues to help us out.

Clue 1 says the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who eats kiwis. Clue 2 says the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Clue 3 says there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who eats a banana. Clue 4 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Clue 5 says there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. Clue 6 says the person who eats grapes lives in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 6. The person who eats grapes lives in the second house. That means the person who eats kiwis can't live in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 1. The person who likes red lives to the right of the person who eats kiwis. If the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house, then the person who likes red can live in the second, third, or fourth house. But we already know the person who eats grapes lives in the second house, so the person who likes red can't live there.

If the person who eats kiwis lives in the third house, then the person who likes red can live in the fourth house. That's a possibility.

If the person who eats kiwis lives in the fourth house, then the person who likes red can't live to the right of them, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of the fourth house.

So, the person who eats kiwis must live in the first or third house. But if they live in the third house, then the person who eats a banana can't live in the third house (Clue 3), and the person who likes green can't live in the third house (Clue 2).

That means the person who eats kiwis must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. Let's see... 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. Each person in the houses is different. They ate different food, got different pets, eat different fruits, like different books, and wear different shoes.

Now, let's look at the clues. The person wearin' runnin' shoes lives to the right of the person eatin' oranges. The mystery book reader lives right next to the cat lover, but on the left side. And the person who had stew lives right next to the mystery book reader.

So, if the mystery book reader lives next to the cat lover, and the person who had stew lives next to the mystery book reader, that means the person who had stew lives on the left side of the mystery book reader. And since the mystery book reader lives next to the cat lover, the person who had stew must live in the house on the left.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

We know the person who likes root beer lives in the first house. That's from Clue 3. Then, Clue 2 says the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. That means the person who likes milk gotta live in the third house, 'cause them's the only three drinks we got.

So, the person who likes milk lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 3 houses, and each house got a person. Each person got different shoes, drinks, eats different fruits, and got different gadgets.

From what I understand, the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house. The person with a phone lives to the left of the person eatin' mangos. The person eatin' grapes lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. The person wearin' boots don't live in the third house. The person eatin' kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk. The person wearin' boots lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. The person eatin' kiwis don't live in the first house.

Now, let's try to figger out who lives where. We know the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house. We also know the person eatin' kiwis don't live in the first house, but they live to the left of the person who likes milk. So, the person eatin' kiwis must live in the second house, and the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The person eatin' grapes lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. But we already know the person eatin' kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the person eatin' grapes must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the second house is incorrect.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all play different sports, got different flowers, and different pets.

From what I understand, the golfer don't live in the third house. The person with the fish lives to the left of the person with the horses. The golfer and the baseball player live next to each other. The person with the carnations and the person with the horses live next to each other too. The person with the carnations lives to the left of the baseball player. The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the daffodils. And the cricketer don't live in the third house.

Now, let's think about this. If the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the daffodils, and the person with the carnations lives to the left of the baseball player, then the order's gotta be: rose bouquet, carnations, daffodils.

The person with the carnations and the person with the horses live next to each other, so the person with the horses can't live in the first house. And since the golfer and the baseball player live next to each other, and the golfer don't live in the third house, they must live in the first and second houses.

But wait, the person with the carnations lives to the left of the baseball player, so the baseball player must live in the second house. And the person with the carnations lives in the second house too, so the person with the horses must live in the third house.

So, the person who owns horses lives in house (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Alright, so we got three houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. One person got a bird, one got a dog, and one got horses. They also got different cars: a convertible, a truck, and a sedan. And they're all eatin' different fruits: oranges, mangos, and bananas.

Now, let's look at the clues. The person eatin' oranges lives in the first house. The person with the truck lives next to the person with the convertible. The bird person lives to the right of the dog person. The person eatin' mangos don't live in the third house. The person with horses lives in the third house. And the person eatin' mangos lives next to the person with the convertible.

Okay, so the person eatin' oranges lives in the first house. That means the person with the truck can't live in the first house, 'cause they gotta live next to the person with the convertible. And the person with the convertible can't live in the first house neither, 'cause the person eatin' oranges already lives there.

So, the person with the truck must live in the second house, and the person with the convertible must live in the third house. But wait, the person with horses lives in the third house! That means the person with the convertible must live in the second house, and the person with the truck must live in the first house. But that can't be right, 'cause the person eatin' oranges already lives in the first house.

I'm all confused now. Let me start again. The person eatin' mangos lives next to the person with the convertible. And the person with the convertible lives next to the person with the truck. So, the person with the truck must live in the second house, and the person eatin' mangos must live in the second house too. But that can't be right, 'cause there's only one person per house.

I'm gonna try again. The person with horses lives in the third house. The person with the convertible lives next to the person eatin' mangos. And the person with the truck lives next to the person with the convertible. So, the person with the truck must live in the second house, and the person eatin' mangos must live in the second house too. But that can't be right, 'cause there's only one person per house.

I think I got it now. The person eatin' oranges lives in the first house. The person with the truck lives next to the person with the convertible. And the person with the convertible lives next to the person eatin' mangos. So, the person with the truck must live in the... (A) 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house has a person with different stuff. They like different books, play different instruments, and ate different food for lunch.

From what I understand, the percussionist lives to the right of the mystery book reader. The mystery book reader lives next to the romance book lover. And there's one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff.

The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist. The guitarist lives next to the percussionist. And the percussionist lives next to the person who had stew.

Now, let's try to put this together. If the mystery book reader lives in house 1, then the romance book lover lives in house 2, and the history book buff lives in house 3. But that doesn't work 'cause the science fiction book fanatic needs to be to the left of the percussionist.

If the mystery book reader lives in house 2, then the romance book lover lives in house 3, and the history book buff lives in house 4. That might work. The science fiction book fanatic could live in house 1, and the guitarist and percussionist could live in houses 4 and 5, but that doesn't work 'cause the percussionist needs to live next to the person who had stew.

If the mystery book reader lives in house 3, then the romance book lover lives in house 4, and the history book buff lives in house 5. That might work. The science fiction book fanatic could live in house 1, the guitarist could live in house 2, and the percussionist could live in house 3, but that doesn't work 'cause the percussionist needs to live next to the person who had stew.

Wait a minute... If the mystery book reader lives in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2, the guitarist lives in house 3, the percussionist lives in house 4, and the romance book lover lives in house 5, that might work. The percussionist lives next to the person who had stew, and everyone else is in the right order.

So, the percussionist lives in house 4.

The answer is (B)"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got a bunch of clues about 5 houses and the people livin' in 'em. Each person got a different car, likes a different kind of book, eats a different kind of fruit, likes a different color, and ate somethin' different for lunch.

From the clues, I know the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. The romance book lover lives in the third house, and the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house.

Now, let's look at the clue that says the person who's eatin' mangos lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV. I don't know who owns the SUV yet, but I know the person who's eatin' mangos can't live in the first, second, or third house 'cause they gotta live to the right of the SUV owner.

I also know the person who's eatin' apples lives in the fifth house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

So, if the person who's eatin' mangos lives to the right of the SUV owner, and the person who's eatin' apples lives in the fifth house, that means the SUV owner gotta live in the fourth house. But wait, the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, so that can't be right.

Let me think about this some more... Ah, I got it! The person who's eatin' mangos lives in the fifth house, but that's where the person who's eatin' apples lives. So, the person who's eatin' mangos must live in the fourth house, but that's where the person who likes yellow lives. That means the SUV owner gotta live in the third house, but that's where the romance book lover lives.

I'm gettin' all confused now... Let me start again. If the person who's eatin' mangos lives to the right of the SUV owner, and the person who's eatin' apples lives in the fifth house, that means the SUV owner gotta live in the fourth house. But the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, so that can't be right.

Wait a minute... What if the SUV owner lives in the third house? No, that can't be right 'cause the romance book lover lives there. What if the SUV owner lives in the second house? No, that can't be right 'cause the person who's eatin' grapes lives there.

I'm stumped... Let me think about this some more... Ah, I got it! The SUV owner lives in the first house, but that's where the person who owns a sedan lives. So, the SUV owner can't live in the first house.

Let me think about this some more... Ah, I got it! The person who's eatin' mangos lives in the fourth house, and the SUV owner lives in the third house. But that can't be right 'cause the romance book lover lives in the third house.

I'm gettin' all confused again... Let me start again. If the person who's eatin' mangos lives to the right of the SUV owner, that means the SUV owner gotta live in one of the first four houses. And since the person who's eatin' apples lives in the fifth house, the person who's eatin' mangos gotta live in the fourth house.

So, the correct answer is:

(D) 4"
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house has a person with different stuff. They like different colors, play different instruments, and have different gadgets.

From what I understand, the person who likes green lives in the third house, and they have a radio. The percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. The person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red.

Let's try to put the pieces together. The percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other, and there's one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow. But we don't know who likes yellow yet.

The person who likes green lives in the third house, so the percussionist and the guitarist must live in the first and second houses. The person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red, and the person who likes red doesn't live in the second house.

I think I got it. The order is percussionist, guitarist, person who likes green, person who has a television, and person who likes red. But wait, the person who likes red can't live in the fifth house because the person who has a television lives next to them.

So, the person who likes red must live in the fourth house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house, but that's not possible because the person who likes green lives in the third house. 

Let me try again. The percussionist lives next to the guitarist, and the person who likes green lives in the third house. The person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red. I think the order is percussionist, person who has a television, person who likes green, person who likes red, and... 

The person who likes white lives next to the percussionist, so the percussionist can't live in the first house. The person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone, and the person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

I'm getting confused. Let me start again. The person who likes green lives in the third house, and they have a radio. The percussionist lives next to the guitarist, and the person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red.

I think I got it. The order is percussionist, guitarist, person who likes green, person who has a television, and person who likes red. But that's not possible. 

Let me try again. The percussionist lives next to the guitarist, and the person who likes green lives in the third house. The person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red.

I think the order is percussionist, person who has a television, person who likes green, person who likes red, and... 

The person who likes white lives next to the percussionist, so the percussionist can't live in the first house. The person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone, and the person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

I'm getting confused. Let me start again. The person who likes green lives in the third house, and they have a radio. The percussionist lives next to the guitarist, and the person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red.

I think I got it. The order is percussionist, guitarist, person who likes green, person who likes red, and... 

The person who likes white lives next to the percussionist, so the percussionist can't live in the first house. The person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone, and the person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

I think the saxophonist lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. Each person in the houses likes different stuff, like drinks, music, pets, and books.

From what I understand, the person who plays the cello lives in the house to the left of the person who likes mystery books. And the person who likes history books lives in the house to the left of the person who has a cat.

Now, the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live right next to each other.

So, if the person who plays the cello lives in house 1, and the person who likes history books lives in house 1 too, that means they're the same person. And if the person who likes mystery books lives in house 2, and the person who has a cat lives in house 2 too, that means they're the same person.

Now, the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live right next to each other. So, one of 'em lives in house 1, and the other lives in house 2.

But we already know the person who plays the cello lives in house 1, and the person who has a cat lives in house 2. So, the person who likes root beer must live in house 1, and the person who plays the guitar must live in house 2.

That means the person who owns horses lives in house 1, 'cause the person who has a cat lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think this through. We got three houses, and each person's got different stuff. They got different pets and different flowers. 

First, the person with carnations lives to the right of the person with a bird. That means the bird person can't be in the last house, 'cause there ain't nobody to the right of 'em. So, the bird person's either in the first or second house.

Next, the dog owner ain't in the second house. That means the dog owner's either in the first or third house.

Now, the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. That means the dog owner can't be in the last house, or there'd be nobody to the right of 'em. So, the dog owner's gotta be in the first house.

If the dog owner's in the first house, and the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner, that means the person with tulips is either in the second or third house. But we know the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird person, and the bird person can't be in the first house 'cause that's the dog owner's house. So, the bird person's gotta be in the second house, and the person with carnations is in the third house.

That means the person with tulips is left with the second house.

Answer: (B)"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From what I understand, we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta use the clues to figger out where each person lives.

Clue 4 says the swimmer lives in the 4th house. That's a good start.

Clue 6 says the person with tulips lives next to the cricketer. Since the swimmer's in the 4th house, the cricketer must be in the 3rd house, and the person with tulips must be in the 2nd house.

Clue 1 says the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person with tulips. So, the person wearin' high heels must be in the 1st house.

Now, let's look at clue 11. It says the person with a rose bouquet lives next to the person eatin' a banana. But we already know the person with tulips is in the 2nd house, so the person with a rose bouquet must be in the 1st house, and the person eatin' a banana must be in the 2nd house. Wait, that can't be right. The person with tulips is already in the 2nd house. So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the 1st house, and the person eatin' a banana must be in the 3rd house.

Clue 5 says the person wearin' loafers ain't in the 2nd house. Clue 10 says the person wearin' loafers ain't in the 3rd house. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in the 1st or 4th house. But the person wearin' high heels is already in the 1st house, so the person wearin' loafers must be in the 4th house, but that's where the swimmer lives. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in the 1st house, but that's where the person wearin' high heels lives. I'm gettin' all confused.

Let me start again. Clue 5 says the person wearin' loafers ain't in the 2nd house. Clue 10 says the person wearin' loafers ain't in the 3rd house. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in the 1st or 4th house. But the person wearin' high heels is already in the 1st house, and the swimmer is in the 4th house. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in the 1st house, but that's where the person wearin' high heels lives. I'm still gettin' all confused.

Wait a minute. What if the person wearin' loafers is in the 1st house, and the person wearin' high heels is in the 1st house too? No, that can't be right. What if... what if the person wearin' loafers is in the 1st house, and the person wearin' high heels is in the 1st house, but that's not possible. Unless... unless the person wearin' loafers and the person wearin' high heels is the same person. That's it! The person wearin' loafers and the person wearin' high heels is the same person, and they live in the 1st house.

So, the answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all eat different fruits, and they all got different pets.

We know the person who eats mangos lives in the first house. We also know the person who owns horses don't live in the first house. And the person who keeps birds and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other.

Now, let's think about the person who eats bananas. They don't live in the third house, and they live to the left of the dog owner. So, the person who eats bananas must live in the second house, and the dog owner must live in the third house.

Now, we know the bird keeper and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other. They can't live in the first and second houses 'cause the person who eats mangos lives in the first house, and the person who eats bananas lives in the second house. They can't live in the third and fourth houses 'cause the dog owner lives in the third house. Wait, that don't make sense. Let me think again.

If the dog owner lives in the third house, and the person who eats bananas lives to the left of the dog owner, then the person who eats bananas must live in the second house. And the bird keeper and the person who eats kiwis must live in the third and fourth houses, but the dog owner lives in the third house. So, the bird keeper must live in the fourth house, and the person who eats kiwis must live in the third house, but that's where the dog owner lives. That don't make sense.

Let me think again. If the person who eats bananas lives to the left of the dog owner, and the person who eats bananas lives in the second house, then the dog owner must live in the third house. And the bird keeper and the person who eats kiwis must live next to each other. They can't live in the first and second houses 'cause the person who eats mangos lives in the first house, and the person who eats bananas lives in the second house. So, they must live in the third and fourth houses, but the dog owner lives in the third house. That means the bird keeper must live in the second house, but the person who eats bananas lives in the second house. That don't make sense.

Wait, I got it! If the person who eats bananas lives to the left of the dog owner, and the person who eats bananas lives in the second house, then the dog owner must live in the third house. And the bird keeper and the person who eats kiwis must live next to each other. They can't live in the first and second houses 'cause the person who eats mangos lives in the first house, and the person who eats bananas lives in the second house. So, they must live in the third and fourth houses, but the dog owner lives in the third house. That means the person who eats kiwis must live in the third house, and the bird keeper must live in the fourth house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and each one's got a person with different likes and pets. 

First, we know the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house. That's a given.

Next, we know the person with birds lives right next to the person who likes history books. Since the mystery book person's in the first house, the bird person must be in the second house, and the history book person's in the third house.

Now we got:
- House 1: Mystery book person
- House 2: Bird person
- House 3: History book person

We also know the romance book person don't live in the third house. And the person with horses don't live in the third house neither. So, the romance book person must live in the second house. But we already know the bird person lives in the second house. That means the bird person's also the romance book person.

And since the person with horses don't live in the third house, they must live in the first house. But we already know the mystery book person lives in the first house. So, the mystery book person's also the one with horses.

Now we got:
- House 1: Mystery book person, horse person
- House 2: Bird person, romance book person
- House 3: History book person

So, the romance book person lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this one out. It says right in the clues that the coffee drinker lives in the second house. So, I reckon the answer is:

(D) 2"
"I think I can figger this out. So, we got 5 houses and people livin' in 'em. They all like different colors, play different sports, and eat different fruits. 

Now, let's look at the clues. It says the person who likes white lives in the second house. That's clue 9. Then it says the person who likes red lives right next to the person who likes white, so that's the third house.

And then, it says the person who's eatin' a banana lives in the third house. That's clue 12. So, I reckon the person who's eatin' a banana lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 3 houses, and each house got a person. Each person got different shoes, likes different books, eats different food, got different flowers, and plays different sports.

From what I understand, the person who had stew lives to the right of the person wearin' high heels. The golfer lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. And the soccer player lives in the second house.

Now, let's think about this. If the soccer player lives in the second house, and the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, then the person with the rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

The person who had stew lives to the right of the person wearin' high heels, but we don't know who's wearin' high heels yet. The golfer lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet, so the golfer must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the flowers. We got rose bouquet, carnations, and daffodils. We already know the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house. The person with the daffodils lives one house away from the golfer, so they must live in the second house, but the second house is already taken by the soccer player, so that can't be right. That means the person with the daffodils must live in the first house, but that's already taken by the person with the rose bouquet, so that can't be right either. That means the person with the daffodils must live in the second house, no, that's taken, so they must live in the first house, no, that's taken, so they must live in the... wait, I got it! The person with the daffodils lives in the second house, no, that's taken, so they must live in the first house, no, that's taken, so they must live in the... third house, no, that's the golfer, so

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all play different instruments, wear different shoes, got different gadgets, and drive different cars.

From what I understand, the person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the minivan. The person with the truck and the person with the gameboy live next to each other. The person with the minivan and the cellist live next to each other. The person with high heels and the person with the TV live next to each other. The person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck. The flutist lives to the left of the person with the minivan. And the person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

Now, let's try to put all this together. The person with the truck and the person with the gameboy live next to each other, and the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck. So, the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy must be in the first and second houses. The person with the minivan and the cellist live next to each other, so they must be in the second and third houses. But wait, the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck, so the person with the minivan must be in the third house. That means the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy are in the first and second houses, and the person with the minivan and the cellist are in the second and third houses. But that don't make sense, 'cause the person with the minivan can't be in two places at once.

Let me think about this some more. The flutist lives to the left of the person with the minivan, so the flutist must be in the second house. The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the minivan, so the person with the phone must be in the first or second house. But the person with the phone can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the flutist lives. So, the person with the phone must be in the first house.

Now, let's go back to the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy. They live next to each other, and the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck. So, the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy must be in the first and second houses, in that order. The person with the phone lives in the first house, so the person with the phone must be the person with the truck. The person with the gameboy lives in the second house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house.

The person with high heels and the person with the TV live next to each other, so they must be in the second and third houses. But the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, so the person with high heels must be the person with the gameboy. The person with the TV lives in the third house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house, so the person with the TV must be the person with the minivan.

The person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in the first or second house. But the person with the phone lives in the first house, and the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, so the percussionist must be in the first house. The person with boots lives in the second or third house, but the person with high heels lives in the second house, so the person with boots must be in the third house. But wait, the person with the TV lives in the third house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house, so the person with boots can't be in the third house. That means the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person with boots must be in the third house.

So, the person with the phone lives in the first house, the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house. The person with the gameboy lives in the second house, but that's where the percussionist lives, so the person with the gameboy must be the percussionist. The person with high heels lives in the second house, but that's where the percussionist lives, so the person with high heels must be the percussionist. But wait, the person with high heels is the person with the gameboy, so the percussionist must be the person with the gameboy.

I think I got it now. The percussionist lives in the first house, and the person with the gameboy lives in the first house, so the percussionist must be the person with the gameboy. The person with the phone lives in the first house, but that's where the percussionist lives, so the person with the phone must be the percussionist. But that can't be right, 'cause the person with the phone can't be the percussionist.

I'm all confused now. Let me start again. The person with the truck and the person with the gameboy live next to each other, and the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck. So, the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy must be in the first and second houses, in that order. The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the minivan, so the person with the phone must be in the first or second house. But the person with the phone can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the person with the gameboy lives. So, the person with the phone must be in the first house.

The person with high heels and the person with the TV live next to each other, so they must be in the second and third houses. But the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, so the person with high heels must be the person with the gameboy. The person with the TV lives in the third house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house, so the person with the TV must be the person with the minivan.

The person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in the first or second house. But the person with the phone lives in the first house, and the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, so the percussionist must be in the first house. But wait, the person with the phone lives in the first house, so the percussionist can't be in the first house. That means the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person with boots must be in the third house.

So, the person with the phone lives in the first house, the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house. The person with the gameboy lives in the second house, but that's where the percussionist lives, so the person with the gameboy must be the percussionist. But that can't be right, 'cause the person with the gameboy can't be the percussionist.

I think I made a mistake again. Let me think about this some more. The person with the truck and the person with the gameboy live next to each other, and the person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck. So, the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy must be in the first and second houses, in that order. The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the minivan, so the person with the phone must be in the first or second house. But the person with the phone can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the person with the gameboy lives. So, the person with the phone must be in the first house.

The person with high heels and the person with the TV live next to each other, so they must be in the second and third houses. But the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, so the person with high heels must be the person with the gameboy. The person with the TV lives in the third house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house, so the person with the TV must be the person with the minivan.

The person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in the first or second house. But the person with the phone lives in the first house, and the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, so the percussionist must be in the first house. But wait, the person with the phone lives in the first house, so the percussionist can't be in the first house. That means the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person with boots must be in the third house.

So, the person with the phone lives in the first house, the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person with the minivan lives in the third house. The person with the gameboy lives in the second house, but that's where the percussionist lives, so the person with the gameboy must be the percussionist. But that can't be right, 'cause the person with the gameboy can't be the percussionist.

I think I got it now. The percussionist lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person who's eatin' apples lives, right? 

Alright, let's look at the clues. Clue 9 says the person who's eatin' apples lives in the fourth house. That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (A) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, drinks, and cars. 

Let's look at the clues. The truck driver lives to the right of the minivan driver. That means the minivan driver's in house 1, and the truck driver's in house 2 or 3.

The person with the rose bouquet lives next to the coffee drinker. And the person with the SUV lives next to the coffee drinker too. That's kinda weird, but I think it means the rose bouquet's in house 1, the SUV's in house 2, and the coffee drinker's in house 3.

The person with the lilies lives in house 2, so that's the SUV person. And the truck driver lives to the right of the root beer lover, so the root beer lover's in house 1.

So, puttin' it all together, I think the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 3 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different cars, food, colors, and flowers.

From what I understand, the person who likes blue lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. The person who had stew lives before the person with lilies. The person with roses lives next to the person with a truck. The person with a minivan lives next to the person who had stew. The person who likes red don't live in the first house. The person with a minivan lives next to the person with daffodils.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. The person who had stew lives before the person with lilies, and the person with a minivan lives next to the person who had stew. So, the person who had stew must live in the first or second house. But the person who likes blue lives in the first house, 'cause they live next to the person who ate spaghetti. And the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who likes blue lives there.

So, the person who had stew must live in the second house, but that's where the person who ate spaghetti lives. Wait, that don't make sense. Let me start again.

The person who likes blue lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. The person who had stew lives before the person with lilies, and the person with a minivan lives next to the person who had stew. The person with a minivan also lives next to the person with daffodils. So, the person who had stew must live in the first house, and they got daffodils.

Now, the person who has a bouquet of roses lives next to the person who drives a truck. The person who drives a truck can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who had stew lives there. And the person who drives a truck can't live in the second house, 'cause the person who ate spaghetti lives there. So, the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Alright, so we got 4 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They got different cars, favorite colors, lunch, sports, and instruments. 

From what I see, the soccer player lives in the second house. The basketball player lives in the fourth house, and they got an SUV. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house too.

The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live next to each other. The person who had stew don't live in the fourth house, so they must live in the first or second house. But the soccer player lives in the second house, so the person who had stew and the person who had pizza must live in the first and second houses.

The person who ate spaghetti lives to the right of the tennis player. The person who ate spaghetti also lives to the left of the saxophonist. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house, and the tennis player must live in the first house.

Now, the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes red can't live in the fourth house. The person who likes red can't live in the second house 'cause the soccer player lives there. The person who likes red can't live in the third house 'cause the person who ate spaghetti lives there. So, the person who likes red must live in the first house, but that's where the tennis player lives. Wait, that means the person who likes red is the tennis player.

The person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the person who likes red. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house, but that's where the soccer player lives. That means the person who owns a sedan can't live in the second house. The person who owns a sedan can't live in the third house 'cause the person who ate spaghetti lives there. The person who owns a sedan can't live in the fourth house 'cause the basketball player lives there and they got an SUV. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Okay, so we got 3 houses, and each house got a person. Each person got different shoes, a different thing to play with, a favorite color, and a favorite fruit.

From what I understand, the person who likes red lives in the second house. The person who eats grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red, so that means the person who eats grapes lives in the third house.

The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, and that's the same house as the person who eats grapes. The person who likes white lives to the left of the person who eats grapes, so that means the person who likes white lives in the first or second house. But the person who likes red lives in the second house, so the person who likes white must live in the first house.

The person who eats apples lives in the first house, and that's the same house as the person who likes white. The person who wears running shoes lives in the first house, but that can't be right 'cause the person who eats apples and likes white lives in the first house. So, the person who wears running shoes must live in the second house, but that can't be right neither 'cause the person who likes red lives in the second house and wears sandals. So, the person who wears running shoes must live in the first house, but that's already taken by the person who eats apples and likes white. Wait, I got it! The person who wears running shoes lives in the first house, and that's the same house as the person who eats apples and likes white.

The person who has a phone lives to the left of the person who wears running shoes, but the person who wears running shoes lives in the first house, so there ain't nobody to the left of the first house. That means the person who has a phone must live in the first house, but that's already taken by the person who eats apples, likes white, and wears running shoes. So, the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. 

We got 4 houses, and we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em. We know the bird keeper lives in the second house, that's clue 1. 

Now, I'm gonna look at the other clues, but I think I already got the answer. The question is askin' where the bird keeper lives, and clue 1 says it's the second house.

So, the answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got two houses, one and two, and we gotta figger out who's eatin' mangos.

We know the sax player lives in house one, and the sax player lives next to the golfer. So the golfer must live in house two.

We also know the romance book lover lives next to the golfer, so the romance book lover must live in house one.

Now, the baseball player lives next to the person eatin' grapes. And the tea drinker lives next to the person eatin' grapes too. But the sax player, romance book lover, and baseball player can't all live in house one, 'cause that's too many people. So the baseball player must live in house two, and the person eatin' grapes must live in house one.

But wait, that don't work neither, 'cause the tea drinker lives next to the person eatin' grapes. So the person eatin' grapes must live in house two, and the tea drinker must live in house two too.

Now we know the sax player, romance book lover, and person eatin' grapes can't all live in house one, so the person eatin' grapes must live in house two. And the tea drinker lives next to the person eatin' grapes, so the tea drinker must live in house two too.

The baseball player lives next to the person eatin' grapes, so the baseball player must live in house one. But the sax player and romance book lover already live in house one, so the baseball player must be the tea drinker.

That don't work neither, so let's try again. The sax player lives in house one, and the golfer lives in house two. The romance book lover lives next to the golfer, so the romance book lover must live in house one.

The baseball player lives next to the person eatin' grapes, and the tea drinker lives next to the person eatin' grapes too. So the person eatin' grapes must live in house one, and the baseball player and tea drinker must live in house two.

But that don't work, so let's try again. The sax player lives in house one, and the golfer lives in house two. The romance book lover lives next to the golfer, so the romance book lover must live in house one.

The baseball player lives next to the person eatin' grapes, and the tea drinker lives next to the person eatin' grapes too. So the person eatin' grapes must live in house two, and the baseball player and tea drinker must live in house one.

That don't work neither, so let's try again. The sax player lives in house one, and the golfer lives in house two. The romance book lover lives next to the golfer, so the romance book lover must live in house one.

The baseball player lives next to the person eatin' grapes, and the tea drinker lives next to the person eatin' grapes too. So the person eatin' grapes must live in house two, and the tea drinker must live in house two too.

The baseball player lives next to the person eatin' grapes, so the baseball player must live in house one. And the sax player and romance book lover already live in house one.

So the person eatin' mangos must live in house two.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all like different fruits, instruments, shoes, colors, and books.

From what I can see, the person who likes green lives next to the person who likes blue (clue 1). And the person who eats apples lives next to the mystery book reader (clue 2). The person who eats apples lives in the 4th house (clue 12).

Now, let's look at the person who likes yellow. They live 2 houses away from the romance book lover (clue 6). And the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who wears high heels (clue 11).

I think I can figger out where the romance book lover lives. If the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who wears high heels, and they live 2 houses away from the romance book lover, that means the romance book lover must live in the 1st house.

So, the answer is (D) 1."
"I think I got it. So, we gotta figure out where the person with boots lives. 

From what I read, it says the person wearin' boots lives in the first house. That's it, that's all we need. 

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all eat different lunch, wear different shoes, play different sports, and drink different things.

From what I understand, the root beer lover lives next to the person wearin' high heels. And the person who only drinks water lives next to the tea drinker. The tea drinker lives next to the person who had pizza.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. The person who had stew lives in house 1. The root beer lover lives in house 2. The person who only drinks water lives in house 3. The tea drinker lives in house 4. And the person who had pizza lives in house 5.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (E) 4"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They like different drinks, got different flowers, ate different lunch, and like different colors.

From what I understand, the person who likes tea lives in the first house. The person with lilies lives in the second house. The person who likes blue lives next to the person who had pizza. The person with tulips lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. The person who likes blue can't live in the first house 'cause that's the tea drinker. And the person who had pizza can't live in the first house neither. So, the person who likes blue must live in the second house, and the person who had pizza lives in the third house.

But wait, the person who had spaghetti lives after the person with lilies, and the person who had grilled cheese lives after the person who had spaghetti. And the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other.

I'm gettin' all confused, but I think I see a pattern. The person who likes red lives next to the person who likes green. And the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes red.

So, if we put it all together, I think the person who likes green lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different cars, flowers, sports, food, and pets. We gotta use the clues to figger out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

From what I see, the person with tulips and spaghetti lives in the first house. That's from clues 12 and 13. 

Now, the person with a minivan and the person with a convertible live next to each other, from clue 8. And the person with a minivan ain't in the third house, from clue 2. So, they must be in the second and third houses.

The person with a sedan lives to the left of the person with a truck, from clue 3. And the person with a truck ain't in the second house, from clue 1. So, the sedan must be in the second house, and the truck must be in the fourth house.

The baseball player lives to the left of the tennis player, from clue 6. And the soccer player lives to the right of the baseball player, from clue 15. 

Now, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the cat lover, from clue 9. And the person who ate fried rice ain't in the fourth house, from clue 11. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

So, the answer is:

(D) 3"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. Each person got their own thing goin' on.

From what I understand, the person eatin' grapes lives in the house on the left, and the person drivin' a truck lives in the house on the right.

The person wearin' boots lives in the house on the left, and they live next to the person who likes mystery books.

The person who likes yellow lives in the house on the left, and they live next to the person drivin' a truck.

So, if we put it all together, the person in the house on the left is eatin' grapes, wearin' boots, and likes yellow. The person in the house on the right is drivin' a truck and likes mystery books.

But we still gotta figger out who likes fantasy books. Since the person in the house on the right likes mystery books, the person in the house on the left must like fantasy books.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1"
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Let's start with the person who likes green. They live in house 3. Now, the person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who ate fried rice. And the person who drives a minivan lives next to the mystery book reader. The romance book lover lives next to the mystery book reader too.

So, we got a group of people: the person who drives a minivan, the romance book lover, and the mystery book reader. They gotta live in houses 1, 2, and 4, in some order. But the person who likes green lives in house 3, so the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice gotta live in houses 1 and 2.

Now, the person who drives a truck lives next to the person who drives a minivan. So, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2, and the person who ate fried rice lives in house 1.

So, the answer is (E) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 4 houses and people livin' in 'em. They all like different stuff, like books, sports, music, colors, and food. We gotta find out who ate pizza and where they live.

First, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. That's from clue 10. Now, the person who had pizza lives next to the basketball player, and the percussionist lives next to the person who had pizza. That's from clues 9 and 5.

The golfer lives in the fourth house, so the person who had pizza can't live there. And the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the third house, but that don't help us much.

Let's think about it like this: if the person who had pizza lives in the third house, then the basketball player would have to live in the fourth house, but we know the golfer lives there. So, that can't be right.

If the person who had pizza lives in the first house, then the percussionist would have to live in a house that don't exist, 'cause the person who ate spaghetti already lives in the first house.

So, the person who had pizza must live in the second house. That's the only one that makes sense.

The answer is (C) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. We got three houses, and three people livin' in 'em. Each person plays a different instrument and a different sport.

We know the basketball player lives in the second house, and the violinist lives in the second house too. That means the violinist and the basketball player are the same person.

We also know the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. That means the cricketer can't live in the third house, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of that one. So the cricketer must live in either the first or second house. But we already know the second house is taken by the violinist/basketball player, so the cricketer must live in the first house.

Now, the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, so the cellist must live in the third house. That leaves the soccer player. The only house left is the first house, but we already said the cricketer lives there. So the cricketer must be the soccer player too.

So, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They got different flowers, favorite colors, drinks, and books. 

Let's start with the person who drinks water. They live in the 4th house, and they like mystery books. The person who likes fantasy books lives next to 'em, so that's the 3rd house.

Now, the person who likes green lives next to the coffee drinker. The coffee drinker can't live in the 4th house 'cause that's the water drinker. And the coffee drinker can't live in the 1st house 'cause the person who likes green would have to live in the non-existent house to the left. So, the person who likes green lives in the 2nd house, and the coffee drinker lives in the 3rd house.

The tea drinker lives to the right of the person who likes red. The person who likes red can't live in the 3rd house 'cause that's the coffee drinker, and they can't live in the 4th house 'cause that's the water drinker. So, the person who likes red lives in the 1st house, and the tea drinker lives in the 2nd house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 4 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all like different drinks, play different sports, got different pets, and play different instruments.

From what I understand, the person who drinks coffee lives in the 4th house, and they're a flutist. They also got horses. That's a lot of stuff in one house.

Now, the person who drinks water and the tennis player live next to each other. They can't be in the 4th house 'cause that's the coffee drinker. So, they gotta be in either the 1st and 2nd or the 2nd and 3rd houses.

The dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other too. And the fish person lives to the right of the basketball player.

If the fish person lived in the 1st house, the basketball player would have to live... um... outside the houses, which don't make sense. If they lived in the 4th house, the basketball player would have to live in the 3rd house, but then the person who drinks water and the tennis player wouldn't have nowhere to live.

If the fish person lived in the 3rd house, it would be a mess too. The dog owner and the root beer lover wouldn't have nowhere to live, and the person who drinks water and the tennis player would be all mixed up.

So, the fish person gotta live in the 2nd house. That's the only way it makes sense.

The answer is (C)."
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got two houses, one and two, and two people livin' in 'em. One's got carnations, the other's got daffodils. One's a pianist, the other's a guitarist.

Now, I know the pianist lives in house two, that's what it says. And it says the person with the daffodils lives next to the pianist. So, if the pianist is in house two, that means the person with the daffodils gotta be in house one.

So, the answer is (A) 1."

The person who eats bananas lives in the fourth house and owns an SUV. The person who has tulips lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible.

Now, let's think about the person who has carnations. They live one house away from the person who has lilies. The person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the person who has carnations.

I'm gonna take a guess here. I think the person who has carnations lives in the second house. That means the person who has lilies lives in the fourth house, but we already know the person who eats bananas lives in the fourth house. So, that can't be right.

Let me think again. If the person who has carnations lives in the third house, then the person who has lilies lives in the fifth house. But we already know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fifth house. So, that can't be right either.

"I think I can figger this out. So, we got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. And we got some clues.

First, the person who likes blue lives next to the root beer lover, but on the left side. That means the root beer lover can't live in the first house, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of it. So, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

Then, we got another clue that says the romance book lover don't live in the first house. That's okay, but it don't tell us where the root beer lover lives.

Next, it says the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. That makes sense, 'cause if the root beer lover lives in the second house, then the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Last, it says the soccer player lives in the second house. I reckon that's the same person as the root beer lover, 'cause they both live in the same house.

So, puttin' it all together, I think the root beer lover lives in the second house.

Answer: (B) 2"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a person with different stuff. They all like different sports, got different flowers, and like different colors.

From what I can tell, the person with daffodils lives in the second house. And the person who likes yellow lives right next to 'em, so that's the first house.

Now, the soccer player don't live in the first or fourth house, so they must live in the third house. And the cricketer lives to the right of the soccer player, so that's the fourth or fifth house.

The person with lilies lives to the right of the swimmer, and the person who likes red lives right next to the person with lilies. The person with tulips and the baseball player live next to each other.

The person with carnations lives to the right of the person with tulips, and the person with roses lives to the right of the person who likes white.

I think I got it! The swimmer lives in the last house, 'cause that's the only one left. So, the answer is:

(A) 5"
"I think I can figger this out. We got two houses, one and two. We know the violin player lives in house one. We also know the person with the computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since there's only two houses, that means the computer's gotta be in house one.

Now, if the violin player's in house one and they got a computer, that means the bird keeper can't be in house one. So, the bird keeper must be in house two.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out which house the person with the computer lives in.

From what I understand, the person with the boots lives in the second house. And the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, and they live next to the person who ate spaghetti, who lives in the fifth house.

Now, the person with the carnations lives next to the person with the running shoes, and the person with the carnations lives to the left of the science fiction book fan. And the science fiction book fan don't live in the fifth house.

The person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and they live to the left of the history book buff. And the person with the lilies lives to the right of the history book buff.

The person with the television lives in the third house, and they had grilled cheese. The person with the gameboy lives in the first house.

Now, the person with the daffodils lives to the right of the person with the tulips, and the person with the computer lives to the right of the person with the daffodils. And the person with the running shoes and the person with the computer live next to each other.

So, if we put all this together, we get:

House 1: rose bouquet, gameboy, fried rice, fantasy book enthusiast, sandals
House 2: boots, tulips, stew, history book buff, high heels
House 3: television, grilled cheese, carnations, romance book lover, loafers
House 4: pizza, daffodils, science fiction book fanatic, running shoes, computer
House 5: spaghetti, lilies, mystery book reader, person who had fried rice is not in this house, so this house must have the person who ate something else

So, the person with the computer lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's think this through. We got three houses, and we know some stuff about the people livin' in 'em.

First, the person wearin' boots lives in the second house. That's a good start.

Next, the person wearin' high heels lives right next to the dog owner. Now, the cat lover lives in the first house, so the person wearin' high heels must be in the first house, and the dog owner must be in the second or third house. But we already know the person in the second house is wearin' boots, so the dog owner must be in the third house.

We also know the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. That's the same house as the dog owner.

The person who owns an SUV lives right next to the person wearin' boots. That means the person in the first house owns an SUV, wears high heels, and is a cat lover.

So, we got:
- House 1: high heels, SUV, cat lover
- House 2: boots
- House 3: sedan, dog owner

Now, we just gotta figure out who's wearin' the runnin' shoes. It can't be the person in the first house 'cause they're wearin' high heels, and it can't be the person in the second house 'cause they're wearin' boots. That means the person in the third house must be wearin' the runnin' shoes.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

We got 3 houses, and each house got a person. Each person likes a different drink, wears different shoes, eats different fruit, got different flowers, and likes a different color.

From what I understand, the person who drinks tea lives in the third house. The person who eats kiwis lives next to the person who likes blue. The person who likes milk and the person who eats apples live next to each other. The person who got carnations lives in the first house. The person who got tulips lives in the second house. The person who wears boots lives next to the person who likes green. The person who wears running shoes lives in the first house. And the person who eats oranges don't live in the third house.

Now, let's think about this. If the person who wears running shoes lives in the first house, and the person who got carnations lives in the first house, then the person in the first house wears running shoes and got carnations. 

The person who got tulips lives in the second house. And the person who wears boots lives next to the person who likes green. So, the person who wears boots must live in the second house, 'cause the person who likes green can't live in the first house.

Now we got:
- First house: carnations, running shoes
- Second house: tulips, boots
- Third house: tea drinker

The person who eats kiwis lives next to the person who likes blue. But the person who likes blue can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who wears boots lives next to the person who likes green. So, the person who eats kiwis must live in the second house, and the person who likes blue must live in the third house.

Now we got:
- First house: carnations, running shoes
- Second house: tulips, boots, kiwis
- Third house: tea drinker, blue

The person who likes milk and the person who eats apples live next to each other. But the person who eats oranges don't live in the third house. So, the person who eats oranges must live in the first house, and the person who likes milk and the person who eats apples must live in the second and third houses. But the person who eats kiwis already lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk must live in the second house, and the person who eats apples must live in the third house is not possible. Therefore, the person who eats apples must live in the second house.

Now we got:
- First house: carnations, running shoes, oranges
- Second house: tulips, boots, kiwis, milk, apples
- Third house: tea drinker, blue

But wait, that don't make sense. The person who likes milk and the person who eats apples live next to each other, but the person who eats kiwis already lives in the second house. So, the person who eats apples must live in the first house is not possible, 'cause the person who eats oranges already lives in the first house.

"Let's think this through. We got three houses, and each one's got someone livin' in it. They all like different kinds of books, and they all got different gadgets.

We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. And they live right next to the history book buff. So, the history book buff must live in the second house.

We also know the mystery book reader lives right next to the person with the TV. That's the history book buff again, so they must have the TV.

Now we got:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (don't know what gadget they got)
- House 2: History book buff (TV)
- House 3: Don't know who or what gadget

We know the person with the computer lives to the right of the person with the phone. The history book buff already got a TV, so the computer and phone must be in houses 1 and 3. The person with the computer is to the right of the person with the phone, so the person with the phone must be in house 1, and the person with the computer must be in house 3.

Now we got:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (phone)
- House 2: History book buff (TV)
- House 3: Don't know who, but they got a computer

The only book type left is science fiction, and the only house left is house 3. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"I think the answer is (A) No.

I've heard of St. Vitus's Dance, and it's like when people's bodies move all crazy and they can't control it. I don't think that would be good for ballet, 'cause you gotta be all precise and stuff. It's like tryin' to dance with a bunch of jerky movements - you'd probably trip over your own feet. So, I don't think someone with St. Vitus's Dance would be good at ballet, let alone win a competition."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes.

I mean, pigs are animals, right? They don't talk like us. They just make noise like ""oink oink"" and stuff. They don't know what we're sayin', and we don't know what they're sayin' either. So, it's pretty obvious they can't use Pig Latin or any other kind of language like we do."
"I think Ringo Starr would avoid the pot roast 'cause I heard he's a vegetarian. So, the answer's (A) Yes."
"I think the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would be too small for a Super Bowl crowd. I mean, I've seen pictures of that old stadium, and it looks pretty old-fashioned. I don't think it's got all the fancy stuff that people expect at a Super Bowl, like lots of bathrooms and food stands.

Plus, I've heard that Super Bowls need a lot of room for all the extra stuff that comes with the game, like the halftime show and the announcers. I don't think the old Olympics stadium would be able to fit all that.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I've seen 'em when I was out fishin' near Nevis. They got a brownish color, so I reckon that's why they call 'em brown rock fish."
"(A) Yes

Growin' seedless cucumbers is good for someone with a fear of bugs 'cause they don't need bees and other insects to help 'em grow. They just grow on their own, so you don't gotta worry 'bout all them creepy-crawlies."
"I think I can figure this out. So, Martin Luther had 95 theses, right? If he did one a day, that's like, 95 days. Half a year is like, 6 months, and that's a lot more than 95 days. So, I think the answer is (B) No."
"I think waltz is way safer than slam dance. I mean, waltz is like a slow dance, right? You're just kinda swaying to the music, not really jumpin' around or nothin'. Slam dance, on the other hand, is like a crazy, wild dance. You're jumpin', spinnin', and crashin' into people. That's just askin' for trouble. I've seen people get hurt doin' that stuff.

So, yeah, waltz is definitely less injurious than slam dance.

(B) Yes"
"I don't think a 1943-S penny would be good for makin' silverware. I've heard them pennies from back then were made of steel, not silver. My buddy's dad was a collector, and he told me they did that 'cause of the war. They needed the copper for other stuff, so they used steel instead. That's why I think the answer is:

(B) No"
"I think snowboardin' on Venus would be super hard, if not impossible. I mean, I've heard it's really hot there, like hotter than a fire. And the air is all weird and stuff, it's not like the air we breathe here on Earth. Plus, I don't think there's even any snow on Venus, so you wouldn't have anything to snowboard on.

So, yeah, I'd say it's a definite no-go for snowboardin' on Venus.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I know a bit about Charlemagne. He was a king, right? Anyway, I don't think his dad was around for the Battle of Tours. I'm pretty sure that was his grandpa, Charles Martel, who fought in that battle. So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, Nissan's from Japan, right? And they use chopsticks there. So, it makes sense that the people workin' at their headquarters would probably use 'em too."
"I think I know this one. Hermes is like the Greek messenger guy, right? He's like the one with the wings on his feet. I don't think he's the same as Vulcan, though. I think Vulcan is more like the god of fire and stuff. He's like the one who makes swords and tools.

So, I'm gonna say (B) No. Hermes isn't the same as Vulcan."
"I think Ariana Grande would be a topic of relevance at a presentation about post traumatic stress disorder. 

I remember hearin' about that terrible bombin' at her concert in Manchester. It was all over the news. She was really shaken up by it, and I think she even talked about how it gave her anxiety and stuff. So yeah, she could be a good example of how people can get PTSD from somethin' like that.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think Jack Black and Bear McCreary do different things, so they probably won't be up for the same award. Jack Black is an actor and a musician, and Bear McCreary does music for movies and TV shows. They're in different areas, so it's unlikely they'll compete.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"(A) No

I've eaten a lot of cucumbers in my day, and I gotta say, they're not all the same. Some are crunchy, some are soft, and some are kinda in between. I like the ones that are crunchy, they're good for snacking. My grandma used to make pickles with the soft ones, and they were real good too. I don't know what kind of cucumbers they were, but they were definitely different from the ones I buy at the store."
"(A) Yes

I think Rick and Morty could be tough for kids of alcoholics to watch. I mean, Rick's always drinkin' and doin' crazy stuff, and it's pretty messed up. If you grew up with a parent who drank a lot, seein' Rick's antics might bring up some bad memories or feelings. It's like, you might think, ""Hey, that's what my dad/mom was like,"" and it could be hard to watch. Plus, the show's got a lot of dark stuff in it, and it's not always easy to deal with. So yeah, I think it could be triggerin' for some people."
"I don't think Simon Cowell can vote for the next Supreme Court judge. I mean, he's a TV guy, right? He's on America's Got Talent and stuff. But I don't think he's got anything to do with pickin' judges. That's the President's job, and then the Senate votes on it. So, I'm gonna say:

(A) No"
"I don't think Jack Dempsey ever saw Conor McGregor fight. Jack Dempsey was a boxer from a long time ago, and Conor McGregor is a mixed martial artist from more recent times. Jack Dempsey was already gone before Conor McGregor started fightin'.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"(B) No 

I don't think Amy Winehouse was a fan of Star Wars: Rogue One. She was a singer, and she died in 2011. Star Wars: Rogue One came out in 2016, so she wouldn't have even seen it."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes.

I've seen people get hooked on stuff that makes 'em feel good, like really good. They get this happy, excited feeling, and they just wanna keep feelin' that way. That's what I think euphoria is. And yeah, it's definitely connected to people gettin' addicted to stuff. They just can't stop chasin' that feelin', even if it's bad for 'em."
"(B) Yes

I think the Apollos would win. I mean, there's this one Apollo who's a god, right? He's like super powerful. He can shoot arrows that always hit their mark and control the sun. That's crazy. I don't think even the best swordsman, like D'Artagnan, could take him down.

And then there's the other Apollos, the astronauts. They're like superheroes, but instead of superpowers, they have cool gadgets and machines. They went to space, for crying out loud! I don't think D'Artagnan could even imagine the kind of tech they have.

D'Artagnan's just a guy with a sword. He's good with it, but I don't think that's enough to take down a god and a bunch of space-faring superheroes."
"I think I know why sunscreen wouldn't help with what Bob Marley had. He died of skin cancer, but it wasn't from the sun. It was a special kind that happens on your hands and feet, and sunscreen don't really help with that.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I know this one. 

The answer is (A) Yes.

I've played some chess with my friends, and I know that if you start with the French Defence, it's like, you move your pawn in front of your king two spaces forward, but then you move the pawn in front of your queen one space forward. That's 1. e4 e6. 

My friend told me that this helps stop the other person from checkmating you in four moves. I don't know all the fancy names, but I think it's 'cause it blocks the way for their queen to get to your king."
"I don't think it's a good idea to drink week-old chlorine water. I've heard that chlorine doesn't last forever in water, and after a while, it's not good for killin' germs no more. My cousin's a plumber, and he told me that chlorine water's only good for a few days, then it's best to make a fresh batch.

I'm pretty sure that if you leave chlorine water sittin' around for a week, it's gonna grow all sorts of bad stuff in it. I've seen it happen before - the water gets all cloudy and smells funny. I don't think that's somethin' you wanna drink.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes.

I'm pretty sure a dichromat could tell the difference between chlorine gas and neon gas. I've seen pictures of chlorine gas, and it's got a weird yellow-green color. Neon gas, on the other hand, is just clear. Even if someone can't see colors like normal, they could probably still tell that one's got color and the other don't."
"I think Elizabeth I of England could've seen that play, Dido, Queen of Carthage. I mean, she was the queen from 1558 to 1603, and I heard that play was done around 1586 or 1587. So yeah, she was still queen when it was performed.

(A) Yes"
"A: (A) Yes

I think you can avoid them internet trolls on Reddit. I mean, I've been on there for a bit, and I've seen some pretty mean stuff. But I just ignore it, ya know? If someone's bein' a jerk, I just don't respond. I don't wanna give 'em the satisfaction.

You can also block people, I think. I've done that before when someone was bein' super annoying. And some of the subreddits I'm in, they got rules and stuff, so the mods will kick out anyone bein' a troll.

I also just stick to the subreddits I like, and I don't go lookin' for trouble. I mean, why bother, right? There's plenty of cool people on Reddit, and I just try to hang out with them.

So yeah, I think you can avoid the trolls if you just be smart about it."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, they're still swimmin' around in the ocean, right? They don't know nothin' about quarantine. They're just doin' their turtle thing, eatin' seaweed and takin' naps on the beach. They ain't got no worries 'bout no virus or nothin'."
"I think Jesus wouldn't know what the Easter Bunny is. I mean, I've heard that the Easter Bunny thing is from a long time ago, but not from Jesus' time. It's like, a German thing or something. I don't think Jesus would know about it.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I think an elephant would win in a fight against a male macaque. I mean, elephants are huge and strong, and they got them big tusks. Macaques are just little monkeys, they don't stand a chance.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think Augustus wasn't his real name. I heard he was born with a different name, like Octavius or somethin'. He got a new name after some important guy, Julius Caesar, adopted him. Then later, he got another name, Augustus. So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I don't think people in the Confederate States spoke Old English before the Civil War. I mean, I've heard of Old English, it's like from a long time ago, right? Like, from England and stuff. I don't think people in the South were talkin' like that back then.

I think they just spoke regular English, like we do now, but with a Southern accent and all. My grandma used to tell me stories about how people talked back then, and it didn't sound like Old English to me.

So, I'm gonna say (A) No, they didn't speak Old English before the Civil War."
"I think Robert Wadlow would be way taller than a German Shepherd. I mean, I've seen German Shepherds before, and they're like, 2 feet tall or somethin'. Robert Wadlow, he's like a giant, over 8 feet tall. That's like, a whole lotta taller than a dog.

So, yeah, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd.

(A) Yes"
"I think ethanol was bad for Jack Kerouac's health. 

(A) No"
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I heard that some kinda blue paint, like ultramarine, was super expensive 'cause it was made from this special kinda rock that was hard to find."
"I think Ryan Crouser could throw a Bengal fox with ease. I mean, he's a big, strong guy who throws heavy stuff for a livin', right? He's like a shot putter or somethin'. I don't know how much a Bengal fox weighs, but I'm pretty sure it's lighter than them heavy balls he throws. So yeah, I think he could toss a fox around like it's no big deal.

(A)"
"I think I know this one. Lord Voldemort, he was a bad guy, right? He didn't like people with non-magical parents. But, I think his dad was a non-magical person, a Muggle. So, if he didn't like people with Muggle parents, that would mean he wouldn't like himself.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. The Jackson 5 had a bunch of siblings in the group, like Michael, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon. They all sang and performed together. The Isley Brothers were a family group too, but I think it was mainly just the brothers, like Ronald, Rudolph, and O'Kelly. They had some other family members help out sometimes, but it wasn't as many as The Jackson 5."
"(A) Yes

You need them little good bacteria, lactobacillus, to make pickles the old way. They help turn the cucumbers sour and keep 'em from goin' bad. My grandma used to make pickles all the time, and she'd always say that the lactobacillus was what made 'em good."
"I don't think there were many robot companies back in 1929. I mean, I've seen old movies and stuff, and they didn't have robots like we do now. So, I'm gonna say the Wall Street Crash of 1929 didn't hurt the stocks of robotics companies.

The answer is (A) No."
"I think Moon Jae-in is from South Korea, and Khanbaliq is an old name for Beijing in China. So, I'm pretty sure he was born in South Korea, not China. 

(A) No"
"I think people with Anorexia Nervosa are more likely to break a bone than regular people. 

I've seen it happen to some friends who had this problem. They didn't eat enough, and it made their bones weak. They'd get hurt easy, and sometimes they'd break a bone just from a little fall.

I think it's because they don't get enough food, and that makes their bones not as strong. It's like when you don't put enough cement in a building, it's gonna fall apart easy.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I reckon the answer is (B) No.

I've heard of them sea shanties, they're songs sailors sing on boats. But the Oregon Trail was a land route, folks walked or rode wagons on it. I don't think them sailors' songs would've been much use on a dusty trail. My granddaddy used to tell stories 'bout the Oregon Trail, and he never mentioned no sea shanties. He said they sang regular songs, like the ones we sing in church or around the campfire."
"(A) Yes

I ain't no lawyer, but I know it's real bad to hurt a bald eagle. I heard it's like, a big deal, 'cause they're America's bird and all. If you shoot one, you can go to jail for a pretty long time. I think it's like, up to 2 years or something. I remember that football player, Michael Vick, he went to jail for dog fightin' and he only did like, 17 months in the slammer. So yeah, shootin' a bald eagle can get you more time than that."
"(B) No

I don't think Gandhi watched Bonanza. I heard he died a long time ago, and I'm pretty sure TV wasn't that big back then. My grandma told me Gandhi was a big deal in India, but she said he died before she was even born. And Bonanza, that's an old cowboy show, right? I don't think it was on TV when Gandhi was alive."
"I don't rightly know much about oceanography, but I did hear about them hornets. I think they might be useful for ocean folks. 

(A) No
(B) Yes

I'm gonna go with (B) Yes. I heard that them hornets can collect water from the ocean and bring it back to their nests. Scientists can then look at that water to learn more about the ocean. I don't know all the details, but it sounds like them hornets might be helpful."
"(A) No, it's cold there, Esperanza Base is in Antarctica."
"A: (A) Yes

I've seen seals and whales in the ocean before, and I know they can be in the same water. I've been fishin' off the coast of New England, and I've seen grey seals swimmin' around. I've also heard stories about whales, like the ones in Moby Dick, bein' in them waters too. So yeah, I reckon it's possible for 'em to be in the same water."
"I don't rightly know what a Trek 9000 is, but I'm pretty sure it's a bike. If that's the case, then you don't need no anchor to park it. You can just use the kickstand or lean it against somethin'. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No"
"(B) Yes, I think so. I mean, I've only ever seen 'em in pictures and stuff, and they're always in Africa, like in the savannas and rivers. I don't think you can find 'em in the wild nowhere else."
"I don't think people celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. That don't sound right. We're supposed to be helpin' the Earth, not hurtin' it. Burnin' tires would just make a big mess and pollute the air. That's the opposite of what Earth Day's about.

(B) No"
"A: (A) Yeah, I think Buddy The Elf knows Jovie's dad, he's a children's book publisher."
"I think hamsters don't live that long, like 2 or 3 years, right? Leap years happen every 4 years, so I don't think a hamster would live long enough to see two of 'em. 

(A) No"
"I don't think Rahul Dravid is a cricket, like the insect. He's a famous cricketer, means he plays the game of cricket. So, I think the answer is (A) No."
"I think the answer is (A) No.

I don't think Puerto Ricans can vote for president. I mean, they're part of the US, but they don't get to vote for the big guy. I'm pretty sure it's just people who live in the states that get to do that."
"(B) No 

I don't think William Franklyn-Miller is a NASCAR driver, I think he's an actor."
"(B) No

I don't think Jacques Duèze and Richard Dawkins would've gotten along. Jacques Duèze was a pope, so he was super into the Church and all that. Richard Dawkins, on the other hand, doesn't believe in that stuff. He's all about science and thinks people should use their brains to figure things out, not just follow what the Church says. They're like complete opposites, so I don't think they'd be friends."
"(B) No, you can't hide a pet macaque under your desk. Them monkeys are too big and loud, and they need a lot of space to move around. They're wild animals, not like a cat or dog that can just sit still. Plus, they got sharp teeth and can hurt you if they get scared or mad. It's not safe to keep 'em in a small space like under a desk."
"(B) No, that don't make no sense. Justin Bieber's a singer, not a politician. Mike Pence was the Vice President, and I don't think a singer would just take his place."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I watch YouTube a lot, and sometimes I see people talkin' about audiobooks in the comments, even when the video ain't about audiobooks. They just start tellin' people what they should listen to, like they're experts or somethin'."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. We use metres for lengths and stuff in the UK."
"I think I know this one. So, Goofy was created by Art Babbit, and he worked for Walt Disney. Walt Disney's brother was Roy Disney. Now, I'm no expert, but I think I read somewhere that Roy Disney was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for marrying a divorced woman. Back then, that was a big no-no. So, I'm gonna say... (A) Yes."
"(A) Yes.

I think some mental disorders can be hidden. Like, people can be really good at hiding their feelings and stuff. My cousin had anxiety, but you wouldn't know it just by lookin' at her. She seemed fine, but she'd tell me about all the stuff that was goin' on in her head. And I've heard of people with eating disorders, like they can hide that too. They might just eat in private or somethin'. I don't know, it's just what I've heard."
"I think Paul Bunyan would be a bad choice for an urban planner. I mean, the guy's huge and he's got a giant axe. He'd probably knock over buildings and stuff just by walkin' down the street. And them giant footprints of his would mess up the sidewalks somethin' fierce. He's better off out in the woods, choppin' down trees and whatnot. Cities are just too small for him.

(A)"
"(A) Yes.

I've seen parsley in different parts of the grocery store. They got the fresh stuff in the produce section, and sometimes they got it in a can or jar in the international aisle. I think I saw it in the spice aisle too, but that's the dried-up kind. And I'm pretty sure I saw frozen parsley in the freezer section once. So yeah, parsley's all over the place in the grocery store."
"I think a football field could fit on Alcatraz Island. I mean, I've seen pictures of the island, and it looks pretty big. A football field is like, you know, a big rectangle, but it's not that huge. I'm pretty sure you could fit one on the island. They used to have a prison and stuff on Alcatraz, so I'm sure they could fit a football field there too.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) Yeah, I think kaffir lime would be alright in a White Russian. I mean, it's a pretty strong flavor, but it's kinda citrusy and stuff, so it might work with the creamy and sweet stuff in the drink. I've had it in some other things before, like Thai food, and it's pretty good. So, yeah, I'd say give it a shot."
"(A) Yes

I think a Goblin shark could ride a bike if it had arms and legs. I mean, it's a smart fish, right? It's got a weird face and all, but it's still a fish. If it had arms and legs, it could probably figure out how to ride a bike. It would just need to balance and stuff. I've seen videos of dogs and cats riding bikes, so why not a shark? It would be pretty cool, actually. Just imagine a shark on a bike, cruisin' down the road."
"Kurt Cobain's music is still popular even after he's gone. I mean, people still listen to Nirvana and all those other bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. They're still makin' music and people still like it.

I think that's 'cause Kurt's music was real, you know? It was about stuff that people go through, like bein' sad and angry. And it was loud and raw, like it was comin' from the heart.

So yeah, his music genre is still alive. I mean, you can still hear it on the radio and at concerts. People still like that kinda music.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes.

I tried grindin' them cheap cinnamon sticks in my spice grinder before, and it just don't work. They're too hard and it just gets all jammed up. I had to use a hammer and a bowl to break 'em down, and even then it was a real pain. I reckon them cheap sticks are just too tough for a spice grinder."
"I think a slingshot would be improperly classified as artillery. I mean, artillery is like big guns and cannons, right? They're huge and shoot far. A slingshot is just a little thing you hold in your hand and shoot rocks or marbles. It's not even close to the same thing.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes, I mean, I seen people eat soup with they hands before, like when they eatin' them little bread bowls or somethin'."
"I don't think so. I mean, I've heard Katy Perry's songs on the radio and they're all pop stuff. I don't think she's really into gospel music. I think she used to sing Christian music or something, but now she's all about pop.

The correct answer is (A) No."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I've seen pictures of the Capricorn sign, and it's like a mix of different animals. It's got the top part of a goat, the bottom part of a fish, and a tail that looks like a snake. That's kinda like the Chimera, right?"
"I don't think Dafne Keen can win the Eurovision Song Contest finals in 2020. I mean, I've seen her in that movie Logan, she's an actress, not a singer. And I think I heard the contest didn't even happen that year because of the pandemic. So, the answer is (B) No."
"(A) Yes

I think Iris and Hermes would struggle at a UPS job. I mean, they're gods and all, but they ain't used to doin' regular people stuff. They're used to flyin' around and doin' magic, not liftin' heavy boxes and dealin' with customers.

Iris is all about the rainbows and pretty colors, and Hermes is all about bein' fast and sneaky. But at UPS, you gotta be careful and make sure you're deliverin' the right packages to the right people. They might get bored or distracted and mess things up.

Plus, they're used to bein' in charge and gettin' their way, but at UPS, you gotta follow rules and listen to your boss. They might not be good at takin' orders from someone who ain't a god.

And what if someone gets mad at 'em? They're used to smitin' people with lightnin' bolts, not dealin' with customer complaints. They might not know how to handle it.

So yeah, I think they'd struggle at a UPS job."
"I don't think Cookie Monster's diet is Paleo friendly. I mean, he eats a lot of cookies, right? And cookies are like, made of sugar and stuff. I don't think that's what Paleo people eat. They eat like, fruits and veggies and stuff. So, I'm gonna say (A) No."
"I think pi is more than the square root of 5. I mean, I don't know the exact numbers, but I know pi is like 3 point something, and the square root of 5 is like 2 point something. So, yeah, pi is bigger.

(A) Yes"
(A) Yes
"I don't think it's bad to have lactic acid in your body. I mean, I've heard it's like a natural thing that happens when you exercise real hard. Like when I'm out mowing the lawn or something, I get all tired and my muscles hurt, and I guess that's when lactic acid is building up. But it's not like it's poison or anything. It's just your body's way of dealing with all the hard work you're doing.

I think it's only bad if you have too much of it, like if you're sick or something. But if you're just exercising and stuff, it's probably fine. My buddy's a personal trainer, and he says it's normal to have some lactic acid in your body after a workout. He says it's just your body's way of recovering.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"I don't rightly know much about them fancy history books, but I do know the Gunpowder Plot was a big deal back in the day. It was when some folks tried to blow up the king, James I. Now, I think he was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots. 

So, if they was tryin' to kill him, and they didn't succeed, that means Mary's bloodline kept on goin', right? I mean, James I had kids and all, so his mom's family line kept on goin'.

So, to answer your question, I reckon the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"I don't rightly know much about them Masonic Lodges, but I do know they're for grown men. My cousin's husband is in one, and he's always talkin' about how it's a men's club. They got rules and stuff, and I'm pretty sure they don't let in no kids or women.

So, if Alice from that Wonderland story wanted to join, I reckon she wouldn't be able to. She's just a little girl, after all.

The answer is (B) No."
"I ain't no expert, but I've heard from some folks who've had run-ins with both bull sharks and crocodiles. They say that a bull shark bite is way worse. See, bull sharks got them powerful jaws and sharp teeth, and they can chomp down with a lot of force. Plus, their teeth are all pointy and can tear flesh real bad. Crocodiles, on the other hand, got a stronger bite, but it's more of a crushin' force. They can snap their jaws shut real hard, but it's not as messy as a bull shark bite.

So, I reckon the answer is (A) Yes."
"I don't think Snow White is a good example of good consent. I mean, the prince just kisses her while she's asleep, and she can't even say yes or no. That's not right. You gotta ask someone if it's okay before you do something like that.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think Avengers Comics would be out of place in a DC Comics store. I mean, Avengers is Marvel, right? And DC is like, Superman and Batman. They're two different things. I don't think you'd find Avengers stuff in a store that's all about DC.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(A) Yes.

I've heard that some people think rhino horns can help with, you know, sex stuff. They think it's like a magic pill or somethin'. But I don't know if it's true. I just know that people are killin' rhinos for their horns, and that's just wrong. My buddy's cousin is a hunter, and he told me that some people are willin' to pay a lot of money for those horns. It's sad, 'cause rhinos are amazin' creatures, and we should be protectin' 'em, not killin' 'em."
"I don't think NFL players get infantry training. They're football players, not soldiers. They practice football, not fightin' in wars. 

(A)"
"I think I know this one. I saw a documentary about Bruce Lee once. He was a famous martial artist, right? Anyway, I remember they said he went to the University of Washington, but he didn't attend his graduation ceremony in 1964. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"I don't think a Zoroastrian would look to the Quran for help with their faith. I mean, the Quran is the holy book of Islam, and Zoroastrianism is a different religion altogether. They have their own set of beliefs and scriptures.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"(B) Yes 

I think Brooke Shields is smart, and she went to a good school, Princeton. I bet she coulda gone to University of Pennsylvania too."
"I think a quarter can fit inside a human kidney. I mean, I've seen kidneys in pictures, and they're pretty big, like the size of a fist. And a quarter's pretty small, so yeah, I think it could fit. 

(A)"
"(A) Yes

I don't think Bruce Gandy would be a good fit for Handel's Messiah. I mean, he's a bagpipe player, and that's not the kind of music you usually hear in Messiah. It's more like classical stuff, you know? I've heard bagpipes at weddings and parades, but not in church music like Messiah. It would sound kinda weird, I think."
"I reckon it's (A) Yes. I've heard of babies bein' born with a lot of hair, and I guess that could include a little moustache. My cousin's baby was born with a full head of hair, and it was pretty funny-lookin'. I ain't no doctor or nothin', but I've seen some weird things in my time, and a baby with a moustache don't seem too far-fetched."
"(B) No, I don't think so. I mean, I ain't no history buff or nothin', but I'm pretty sure the Treaty of Versailles was a big deal, and I don't recall hearin' about no blueberry scones bein' involved. It was after World War I, and I think it was all about Germany and the other countries makin' a deal to end the war. I don't know, maybe they had some tea and biscuits or somethin', but blueberry scones? Nah, I don't think so."
"(A) No

I don't think most people would be happy if their grocery store meat tasted like game. I mean, when you buy meat from the store, you expect it to taste like regular meat, not like something you'd hunt in the woods. My buddy's a hunter, and he says game meat's got a strong taste that's not for everyone. If people wanted that kind of taste, they'd probably go to a specialty store or hunt it themselves."
"I don't think the founders of Skype are from Asia. I think they're from Europe or somethin'. I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere. 

(B) No"
I don't rightly know who Sockington is or what kinda food he likes. Never heard of him.
"(A) Yes

I think you might see storks at a baby shower 'cause of that old story that storks bring babies."
"I don't think the Greek alphabet is as common as Sumerian cuneiform. I mean, I've heard of the Greek alphabet, it's like the one with the weird letters, right? But Sumerian cuneiform, that's like, really old stuff. I think I saw it in a documentary or something. It's like, from ancient times, and it was used by a lot of people back then.

So, I'm gonna go with (B) No."
"I don't think Secretariat won no Formula One championship. I mean, I've heard of him, he's a famous horse, right? He won some big horse races, but I don't think he ever drove a car in no Formula One. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"I reckon a cattle farmer could be useful to a drum maker. I mean, we got a lot of cowhides on our farm, and I've seen some folks use 'em to make drums. They're good for that sorta thing, 'cause they're tough and can make a nice sound when you hit 'em.

So, yeah, I think a cattle farmer could help a drum maker out. We could sell 'em some of our hides, and they could use 'em to make their drums.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think the answer is (B) No.

I've seen some Star Wars movies, and I don't recall anyone sayin' ""beam me up."" That sounds more like somethin' from Star Trek. I've seen some of those too, and they got them transporter thingies that can move people from one place to another. That's when I hear 'em say ""beam me up."""
"(A) Yes

I think it's okay to wear a crucifix. I've seen lots of people wear 'em, especially to church or on special occasions. It's like a symbol of their faith, ya know? My grandma used to wear one all the time, and she said it reminded her of Jesus and what he did for us. I don't see why it wouldn't be okay to wear one, unless maybe you're wearin' it to make fun of someone or somethin'. But if you're wearin' it 'cause you really believe in it, then I think that's alright."
"I don't think the Swiss Guard can fill the Virginia General Assembly chairs. I mean, they're like a special army for the Pope, right? They're in a whole different country. I don't think they'd be able to just come here and be part of our government. They're not from around here, and I don't think they'd know what's best for Virginia.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I don't think placozoa can get learnin' disabilities. They're like, super simple animals, right? They don't even have a brain or nothin'. So, I reckon they can't learn or forget stuff like we do.

The answer is (B) No."
"I think Bart Simpson coulda had comics with The Joker in 'em. I mean, The Joker's been around for a pretty long time, and Bart likes readin' comics. So yeah, it's possible.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) No, 50 Cent and Ja Rule, that's Jeffrey Atkins, they had beef back in the day."
"I don't rightly know the laws in Somalia, but I think they got some pretty strict rules based on their religion. I'm pretty sure they follow Sharia law, and that's got some harsh punishments. But I don't think bein' celibate is against the law, 'cause that just means someone chooses not to have sex. I think the laws are more about people doin' stuff that's against their rules, like adultery or bein' gay. So, I reckon a celibate cleric would be okay, 'cause they're just choosin' not to do somethin', not doin' somethin' wrong.

(A) No"
"I think I know this one. The Riksdag is like, a big group of people in Sweden that makes laws and stuff. So yeah, it's a thing in Scandinavia. 

(B) Yes"
"I think spaghetti shouldn't be slick when it's done. I mean, when I cook it, I like it when it's still got a little bite to it, you know? If it's all slick and stuff, it's probably overcooked. My mom used to say that's when the starch comes out and makes it all sticky. So, I'd say the right answer is:

(A) No"
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I heard that Isaac Newton was sittin' under a tree, and an apple fell on his head. That's when he figured out that stuff about gravity. Apples are usually red, so yeah, I guess he's associated with 'em."
"I don't think it's a good idea to have a jackfruit thrown at your head. Them things are huge and heavy. I've seen 'em at the market, and they're like a big ol' melon, but way bigger. If someone threw one at your head, it could hurt you real bad. You could get a concussion or even a broken skull. I wouldn't want that to happen to nobody.

The correct answer is (A) No."
"(A) No

I think if Christopher Reeve didn't have a lot of money, he might not have lived as long. He got hurt real bad in that horse accident and needed a machine to breathe. If he was poor, I don't think he could've afforded that machine and the doctors to take care of him."
"I think I know this one. It's about George Washington's birthday, right? My buddy's a mailman, and he gets that day off. It's a federal holiday, so I'm pretty sure the answer is (A) Yes."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that a lot of people in the US have dyslexia, and it's like, a big deal. My cousin has it, and it makes it hard for him to read and stuff. I don't know the exact numbers, but I've heard it's pretty common."
"I think Jackie Chan would be okay talkin' to a deaf person. I saw him in a movie once, and he was signin' to someone. I don't know if he's fluent or nothin', but he seemed to know some sign language. So, I'd say (A) No, he wouldn't have trouble communicatin' with a deaf person."
"I think you'd be more likely to die of hypothermia in New York than Florida. I mean, it's way colder up there, especially in the winter. I've seen it snow and get really cold in New York, but Florida's always warm. So, I'd say the answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) No, I don't think so. John Kerry is an American politician, so I don't see why he'd be runnin' in some election in the UK."
"I think I can help with that. 

So, you're askin' if binary numbers and alphabet letters can make a strong password. I'd say yeah, they can. 

I mean, if you mix 'em up with some other stuff like numbers and special characters, and make it long enough, it's gonna be hard for someone to guess. Like, if you use a word and then add some binary numbers to it, or use a bunch of letters and then throw in some numbers, that's a pretty good start.

But if you just use binary numbers or just alphabet letters, it's not gonna be that strong. You gotta mix it up. 

So, to answer your question:

(A) Yes"
"(B) Yeah, lunch on the beach is a good time to see a full circle rainbow. I seen one once when I was eatin' a sandwich on the beach after a quick rain. The sun was shinin' through the water drops in the air, and it made a big ol' circle in the sky. It was pretty cool."
"(A) Yes 

I think Abdulqawi Yusuf goes to the Hague on a typical work day 'cause he's a judge at the International Court of Justice, and that's where it's located."
"I think Nancy Drew is like a private investigator. She solves mysteries and stuff, even though she's not a grown-up. She's like a detective, but not a cop. She does it on her own, so that's kinda like being a private investigator, right?

The answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) Yes

I think Nancy Pelosi and Gerald Ford would've been on the same side if it's about not wanting to impeach the President. I know Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat and Gerald Ford was a Republican, but I also know Gerald Ford didn't want to impeach President Nixon. I'm pretty sure Nancy Pelosi wouldn't have wanted to impeach him either, 'cause she's all about being nice to people in power, right?"
"A: (A) Yes

I think an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility would be super loud and make a big boom. When stuff like that blows up, it makes a big shock wave that goes really, really fast - faster than the speed of sound. I've seen videos of explosions and they always make a big blast that breaks stuff. So yeah, I think it would make a supersonic shock wave."
"(B) Yeah, I think I heard of people puttin' anchovies on their pizza, and I'm pretty sure they come from the Black Sea."
"(B) No

I think Bill Nye is that science guy, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a president a long time ago. Bill Nye was born in 1955, and Roosevelt died in 1945, so I don't think Bill Nye could've voted for him."
"The answer is (A) Yes. I think Canada's still got a queen, or maybe it's a king now, I don't know. But yeah, we got some kinda royal person from England that's like, in charge or somethin'."
"(B) Yes

I've been playin' guitar for years, and I gotta say, my fingers are way tougher than they used to be. When I first started, pressin' down on them strings hurt like crazy, but now it's no big deal. I think it's 'cause my fingers got used to it, ya know? They're like, ""Oh, you're gonna press down on me again? Okay, no problem.""

I also got these calluses on my fingers, and they help a lot. They're like little pads of skin that protect me from the strings. I've seen other guitar players with 'em too, so I know I'm not the only one.

I'm not sayin' I don't feel pain at all, but it's definitely not as bad as it used to be. I can play for hours without gettin' all sore and stuff. So yeah, I think guitar players' fingers can handle pain better than average."
"(A) No

I've heard of Kami Rita, he's that super strong mountain climber from Nepal. He's been to the top of Mount Everest a bunch of times, and that's way higher than Mount Emei. I think Mount Emei's like, a lot lower, so I reckon it'd be a piece of cake for him."
"I think I can do Sudoku with them Roman numbers. I mean, we got I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. That's 9 numbers, right? And Sudoku's got 9 little boxes. So yeah, I think it's possible. 

(A) Yes"
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, if it's daytime, it's usually light outside, right? Unless it's nighttime or somethin', but the question says daytime. So, it shouldn't be dark."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. If Spirit, like the Mars rover, sent a message back to Earth in 2020, that's some big news, right? I mean, it's been years since it stopped workin' in 2010, so if it suddenly started talkin' again, that'd be huge."
"(B) Yes

I don't think pancakes are good for cats. My neighbor's cat got sick after eatin' some pancakes, and the vet said it was 'cause they're bad for 'em. Cats need food that's made for 'em, not people food. Pancakes got a lot of sugar and stuff that's not good for cats. My mom's friend's cat even got sick from eatin' somethin' with chocolate in it, and pancakes can have chocolate chips. So, it's best to just stick with the cat food, ya know?"
"I don't think Nine Inch Nails had anything to do with Aretha Franklin's sound. I mean, she was like, a soul singer from way back, and they're more like... industrial rock or something. I don't know, I'm not a music expert or anything, but it just don't seem right.

The correct answer is (B) No."
"(B) No, Jon Brower Minnoch was actually the heaviest person ever recorded, so he didn't have anorexia."
"I don't rightly know much about this H.G. Wells fella or his book ""War of the Worlds"", but I'm pretty sure it's about Martians comin' to Earth and causin' a ruckus. I don't recall hearin' anything about cosmic rays in it, so I'm gonna take a guess and say:

(A) No"
"(A) Yeah, it's better to have different colored pens for sudoku. I like to use 'em to mark the numbers I think might go in a spot, and the colors help me keep track of which ones I'm sure about and which ones I'm just guessin'."
"I don't know much about this stuff, but I'll try my best. 

I think the answer is (B) No.

I've heard of some old religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, and they've been around for a really long time. I don't think any of the religions that think the Himalayas are special started in the 1800s."
"I think white rice can go bad before sesame seeds. I've seen it happen before. When you leave white rice out for too long, it gets all stale and smells funny. Sesame seeds, on the other hand, seem to last a lot longer. I've had sesame seeds in my pantry for months and they still taste fine.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"I don't think penicillin can help with learnin' disabilities. I mean, it's an antibiotic, right? It's for when you're sick with a bad infection. My cousin's kid has a learnin' disability, and they go to special classes and get extra help from teachers. They don't take no penicillin for it.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I think I've heard of that happenin' before. 

(A) Yes

My cousin's friend had a tumor in her adrenal gland, and it made her body produce too much adrenaline. She was always jittery and had high blood pressure. The doctors said it was because of the tumor. I don't know all the details, but I know it was a real thing."
"I don't think people in Vellore Fort had to worry 'bout grizzly bears. I mean, I've lived 'round these parts all my life, and I ain't never seen no grizzly bears. We got other animals like monkeys and snakes, but no grizzly bears. They're not from 'round here.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think the brain is in the head, not the torso. The torso is like, the middle part of your body, right? It's where your heart and stomach and all that stuff is. The brain's up in your skull, so I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I think a 500GB USB thingy is a lot of space. I mean, I've seen those little sticks hold a bunch of movies and stuff. 

If you're talkin' about savin' 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, that's a lot of watchin'. But I think 500GB is enough. I've seen some movies that are like 2-4 GB each, and that's for a 2-hour movie. So, 10 hours of shows would be like 5-10 of those movies. That's 10-40 GB. 

So, yeah, I think 500GB is enough. You could save a bunch of days' worth of shows on that thing.

(B) Yes"
"I think I can figure this out. So, we got this guy Jon Brower Minnoch, and he's super heavy, right? Like, the heaviest person ever. I think I read he weighed like 1,400 pounds or somethin'. 

Now, we got this spaceship, Voyager 2, and it's got a lot of stuff in it, so it's pretty heavy too. I think it weighed like 1,820 pounds when it took off.

So, if we're talkin' about a chair, and we're wonderin' if Jon Brower Minnoch would break it before Voyager 2 would, I'd say no way. I mean, the chair would have to be able to hold 1,820 pounds if it's gonna hold Voyager 2, and Jon Brower Minnoch only weighs 1,400 pounds. That's a lot less.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I think hedgehogs would avoid animals without a spinal cord. I mean, them spines on a hedgehog's back are for keepin' predators away, right? But if an animal don't got a backbone, it might not feel pain like we do. So, them spines might not scare 'em off.

I've seen starfish and worms and stuff, and they just keep on movin' even if you hurt 'em. They don't seem to care. So, if a hedgehog's spines can't hurt 'em, then the hedgehog might just avoid 'em instead of tryin' to fight 'em off.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) Yes."
"I don't think the iPhone had anything to do with the scientific revolution. I mean, I've heard of the scientific revolution, it's like, a long time ago, right? Like, hundreds of years ago. And the iPhone is a phone that came out like, 15 years ago or something.

I think the scientific revolution was more about people like Galileo and Newton, who figured out a lot of stuff about the world and the universe. They didn't have iPhones back then, that's for sure.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No. The iPhone didn't usher in the scientific revolution."
"I don't think it matters if you're right-handed or left-handed when it comes to American Sign Language. I've seen people sign with either hand, and it's more about how you move your hands and fingers to make the signs. My cousin's friend is deaf, and she signs with her right hand, but she's actually left-handed. So, I think the answer is:

(B) No"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, Lolcats are just pictures of cats on the internet, right? They don't need food 'cause they're not real."
"I think Garfield wouldn't like canid food. He's a cat, and cats don't eat dog food. My neighbor's cat only eats cat food, and I think it's 'cause it's made special for 'em. So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, silicon sounds like a pretty common thing, and I've heard of people gettin' silicon rings 'cause they're safe for work and stuff. I don't know what bromine is, but it sounds weird. I've never heard of anyone gettin' a bromine ring."
"(A) Yes

I think it's normal for people to sing when the YMCA is mentioned 'cause of that one song, you know, ""Y.M.C.A."" by the Village People. It's like, super catchy and everyone knows it. Whenever someone says ""YMCA"", people just start singin' it. It's pretty funny, actually."
"I don't rightly know all the details, but I think United Airlines had some fault in that big crash. I'm pretty sure it was the one in '77, two 747s collided on a runway in the Canary Islands. I recall hearin' it was a mix-up with communications and procedures. So, I'd say:

(B) No"
"I think the Liberty Bell ain't in the same spot it was a long time ago. I mean, I've seen it in Philly, but I don't think it's in the same building it was when they first got it. 

(A) No"
"(A) No, you can't use Dustin Hoffman's Oscars as pins in a bowling alley lane. Them Oscars are fancy awards and they're way too small and heavy for bowling. Plus, they're super valuable, so it wouldn't make sense to knock 'em down with a bowling ball."
"I think beavers got some big teeth, but they ain't nothin' like them saber-toothed cats. I mean, I seen pictures of them Smilodons, and they got them huge, long teeth that stick outta their mouth. Beavers just got them big front teeth for gnawin' on wood and stuff. They ain't made for killin' big animals like them Smilodons were.

So, I'd say (A) No, a beaver's teeth don't rival them of a Smilodon."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes.

I've heard that a long time ago, people started growin' their own food near rivers. The rivers made the land good for farmin' and they had water for their crops. My grandpa used to tell me that rivers are important for growin' stuff, and that's why a lot of old cities were built near 'em."
"I don't think art is a big deal in schools no more. I mean, I went to school and we didn't do much art. We did some in elementary school, but after that, it was mostly just math, reading, and science.

I think the answer is (B) No."
"(B) No 

I don't think Daniel LeFever had anything to do with Kurt Cobain's death. I mean, I've heard of Kurt Cobain, he was that famous singer from Nirvana, right? He died from a gunshot wound, and it's pretty well-known that it was a suicide. I don't know who Daniel LeFever is, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't involved in Kurt's death."
"(A) No

I don't think a two-year-old could win a Scrabble tournament. They're still little kids, they don't know that many words, and they can't even spell 'em right. They're still learnin' how to talk and read, so playin' a game like Scrabble is way too hard for 'em. Plus, they get distracted easy and can't sit still for that long. I mean, I've seen 'em play with blocks and stuff, but Scrabble's a whole different story. It's a game for grown-ups and smart people, not little kids."
"I think Harry Potter can book a flight on Asiana Airlines. I mean, he's a person, right? So, if he's got the money and a passport, I reckon he can book a flight. 

(B) Yes"
"I don't think Steven Spielberg could send emails as a kid. I mean, I've heard of him makin' movies and stuff, but email? That's somethin' we got now, not back then. I think email came out like, in the 90s or somethin'. So, I'm gonna say:

(B) No"
"I think it's (A) Yes. I heard Theodor Geisel, who's also known as Dr. Seuss, liked the color green. He used it a lot in his books, like ""The Lorax"" and ""Green Eggs and Ham"". People liked his stories and pictures, and that's how he got famous."
"I think the Greeks had somethin' to do with buildin' that big lighthouse in Egypt. I mean, I've heard it was built a long time ago, like, over 2,000 years ago, and the Greeks were pretty good at buildin' stuff back then.

So, I'm gonna say (B) Yes, the Greeks were essential to craftin' the Egyptian Lighthouse of Alexandria."
"I think I know this one. Keith Richards, he's that guitar player from The Rolling Stones, right? I saw him in a movie once, playin' a pirate. He was a captain of a boat, I think. So yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think gettin' checked out by a doctor and takin' care of yourself can help stop the spread of them STIs. 

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes.

I've heard that the story of Jesus is kinda like some other old stories from Egypt. Like, Jesus was born from a virgin, and so was this Egyptian god named Horus. And they both did some pretty cool stuff, like healing people and stuff. And they both died and came back to life.

I don't know all the details, but it seems like there's some similarities between the two stories. Maybe the people who wrote about Jesus were inspired by the Egyptian stories or something. I don't know, I'm no expert or anything. But it's pretty interesting to think about."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, if Methuselah lived a really long time, like the Bible says, then he would probably hold some kinda record, even if it's just for bein' the oldest person. The Common Era is like, a way of countin' years, right? So if he lived a long time ago and lived for a really long time, then yeah, he'd probably hold a record."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. I mean, people from Burundi and New Brunswick can talk to each other if they wanna. They might not speak the same language or nothin', but they can still use them translation thingies or find someone who speaks both languages. Or maybe they can just use them fancy phone apps that translate for ya. So yeah, I reckon they can communicate just fine."
"I think a pacifist would be against hunting. They don't like violence, and hunting is killin' animals. They're all about bein' peaceful and not hurtin' nobody, so I reckon they wouldn't be okay with huntin'.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, the American flag's got 13 stripes, and they're just colors, right? So, if the voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny each wanted one stripe, that's just two stripes out of 13. That's like, a lot left over."
"(B) No

I don't think SnapCap is a retail store. I've never seen one in a mall or on the street. I think it's one of them online places that helps people with money stuff."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I saw a picture of the Statue of Liberty once, and it said the Statue of Freedom is on top of the U.S. Capitol building. I also saw a picture of the Statue of Liberty from far away, and you can see the city from there. The U.S. Capitol building is in the city, so I think you can see the Statue of Freedom from the Statue of Liberty."
"(B) Yeah, I think Jason and Dr. Disrespect both like playin' video games, especially them shoot 'em up ones."
"I don't think deaf people are left out of enjoying music. I mean, I've seen 'em at concerts, feelin' the beat and all. They can feel the music through the floor or their seats, like when the bass is pumpin'. Some of 'em even use special vests that vibrate to the music.

And I've seen sign language interpreters at concerts too, so they can follow the lyrics. It's pretty cool, actually. They can still enjoy the music, just in a different way.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"(A) Yeah, that's right. I mean, Mount Sharp is on Mars, and people ain't been there yet, so there ain't no human footprints."
"I don't think Lionel Richie ever had dinner with Abraham Lincoln. I mean, I know Lionel Richie is a famous singer and all, but Abraham Lincoln was like, a president a long time ago. He died way before Lionel Richie was even born. So, it's not possible for them to have had dinner together.

The answer is (A) No."
"(A) Yeah, honey's associated with queens, 'cause in beehives, there's a queen bee, and she's the one that lays eggs and all that. The worker bees, they make honey, but the queen's kinda in charge of the whole hive, so I guess you could say honey's her thing."
"I don't think the Eiffel Tower was built for the French Revolution. I mean, I've heard it was built for some kinda big fair in Paris, like a world's fair or somethin'. I think it was a long time after the French Revolution, too. So, I'd say the answer is:

(A) No"
"I think the answer is (A) No.

If you get hit in the leg, it's gonna hurt a lot, and that pain can go up to your body. And if you get hit in the ear, it's gonna hurt your head, and that can make your whole body feel bad. So, I don't think your torso would be safe if you get hit in the biggest or smallest bone."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes.

I've heard of this guy, Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu, he was a doctor a long time ago in Turkey. And Börek is like a pastry thingy that people in Turkey like to eat. I'm pretty sure it's been around for a long time, so it's likely he would've had some."

"I think Alec Baldwin has more kids than Clint Eastwood. I mean, I've seen Alec on them tabloids a lot with his wife Hilaria, and they got a bunch of little ones runnin' around.

"I think Karl Marx had a big impact on the communist party in China. I mean, they're a communist country, right? And Marx was like, the guy who came up with communism. So, it makes sense that his ideas would influence them.

I've heard that Mao Zedong, the leader of China back in the day, was really into Marx's stuff. He took some of Marx's ideas and made them his own, and that's how China became the country it is today.

"I think I can figure this out. So, we gotta see if this rich guy, Michael Bloomberg, can pay off the debt of Micronesia for 10 years.

I heard Michael Bloomberg is super rich, like, he's got 76 billion dollars. That's a lot of money.

Now, I don't know exactly how much Micronesia owes, but I think it's around 100 to 200 million dollars a year. Let's just say it's 150 million, that's a nice round number.

So, if Micronesia owes 150 million a year, and we want to know if Michael Bloomberg can pay it off for 10 years, we gotta multiply 150 million by 10.

150,000,000 x 10 = 1,500,000,000

That's 1.5 billion dollars. Michael Bloomberg's got 76 billion, so yeah, he can definitely pay off Micronesia's debt for 10 years.

(A) Yes"
"I think the names of them Powerpuff Girls are all them same soundin' names. You know, like when you say 'em out loud, they all start with the same letter. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup all start with ""B"". So yeah, I reckon that's a thing.

(B) No"
"I don't think Andy Warhol had anything to do with Art Deco style. I mean, I've seen pictures of Art Deco stuff, and it's all fancy and old-fashioned, like from the 1920s and 30s. It's got a lot of shiny metal and weird shapes. Andy Warhol, on the other hand, was a guy who made pictures of Campbell's Soup cans and Marilyn Monroe. He was all about the 60s and 70s, not the old days.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"(A) No

I think people in Mumbai call it a brinjal, not an eggplant."
"I think the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan. I mean, Mount Fuji is a really tall mountain, and the sea isn't that deep, right? I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that Mount Fuji is over 12,000 feet tall, and the deepest part of the Sea of Japan is like, a little less than that. So yeah, I think the top of the mountain would be above the water.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think you can make a Shogi board from a chess board. I mean, they're both just squares, right? You can use the chess board and just imagine the extra squares on the side.

So, yeah, I think the answer is (B) Yes."

"I think I got it. So, if someone was born in 1996, that's a leap year, right? That means they only have a birthday every 4 years. But, we don't count age like that. We count it by how many years have passed since they were born.

So, if they were born in 1996, by the year 2000, 4 years would have passed. But, the question is asking if they would be 1 year old in 2000. That don't make sense, 'cause they'd be way older than that. But, if we're just lookin' at the options, I'd say the closest one is (B) Yes, 'cause they would be 4 years old, but that's not what the question is askin'.

I think Mickey Mouse wouldn't buy stuff on Zazzle 'cause they got rules about copyin' stuff. If someone made a shirt or mug with Mickey on it without askin' Disney, that's not right. Zazzle wouldn't let 'em sell it. So, Mickey wouldn't find much stuff with himself on it to buy."

(A) Yes"

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I don't think onions have anything to do with makin' a thermonuclear bomb. I mean, I've chopped up a lot of onions in my day, and I've never seen anythin' that'd make me think they're good for that sorta thing.

I think you need special stuff, like the kinda things scientists and engineers work with, to make somethin' like a thermonuclear bomb. Onions are just for cookin' and makin' you cry when you chop 'em up.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I don't think the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would support Trickle Down Economics. 

I mean, communism is all about everyone being equal and sharing stuff, right? Trickle Down Economics is like the opposite of that. It's when rich people get richer and then maybe, just maybe, some of that money will go to the poor people. That doesn't sound very fair or equal to me.

Ashland, Oregon has around 21,360 people, I think. That's a pretty big town. If you were to make a military division out of the whole town, you'd have enough people. You'd even have some left over.

And if someone's hurt, they can give 'em some basic first aid. So yeah, I think paratroopers would be good at mountain rescue."
"(B) Yes

I don't think Quiet would be a good teacher at Haub. She's a fighter, not a talker. She don't say much, so how's she gonna teach people stuff? And she's all about sneakin' around and shootin' people, not about business or nothin' like that. I don't think she'd be good at helpin' students or explainin' things to 'em."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, I've never heard of anyone growin' watermelons in Antarctica, it's all ice and snow there. But I know people grow watermelons in warm places, and Brazil's one of 'em. My cousin went to Brazil once and said it was super hot, so I reckon that's a good place for growin' watermelons."
"(B) Yeah, I think it's 'cause of that time Jenny McCarthy was on Saturday Night Live (SNL) and made fun of her cousin, Melissa McCarthy. Melissa's a comedian too, and I guess Jenny was just tryin' to be funny, but maybe it hurt Melissa's feelin's or somethin'."
"I think it'd be real hard to get toilet paper if there were no loggers. I mean, they're the ones who cut down trees, and I'm pretty sure that's where toilet paper comes from. My buddy's cousin works at the paper mill, and he says they need wood to make the stuff. So, if nobody's cuttin' down trees, I reckon we'd be in a bit of a bind. 

(B) Yes"
"I don't think a silverfish could make it to the top of the Empire State Building. I mean, those things are pretty small and they don't exactly look like they're built for climbin' skyscrapers. They're more like the kind of bugs you find in your basement or attic, right?

I've seen 'em scurryin' around on the walls and stuff, but they don't seem like they could handle a big ol' building like that. Plus, it's a long way up, and I don't think they'd be able to breathe or somethin' up that high.

So, I'm gonna say (B) No, a silverfish couldn't reach the top of the Empire State Building."
"(A) Yeah, I reckon you could use an armadillo as a shield. They got them hard shells on their backs, like built-in armor. If you was in a tight spot, you could hold one up in front of you and it might just block whatever's comin' at ya. Course, it'd be kinda crazy to try, 'cause armadillos can roll up into a ball and they might just squirm right outta your hands. But if you could hold onto it, that shell might just do the trick."
"(B) Yeah, I think Siri knows some geometry stuff. I mean, I asked her what's the formula for the area of a circle, and she told me it's pi r squared. I also asked her what's the sum of the angles in a triangle, and she said it's 180 degrees. So, yeah, Siri knows some geometry."
"I don't think you can catch largemouth bass in the Canary Islands. I've never heard of 'em bein' there. They're a freshwater fish, and I think they're mostly found in the States and other places with lakes and rivers. The Canary Islands are out in the ocean, so I don't think they'd be there.

The answer is (B) No."
"I don't think sloths would explode if they're not upside down. I mean, I've seen pictures of 'em on the ground, and they seem fine. They're just kinda... slow, ya know? They like to hang upside down 'cause it's comfy for 'em, but I don't think it's like, a necessity or nothin'.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"Blimey, I reckon it's possible to binge-watch the whole EastEnders series without water, but I gotta say, that's bloomin' crazy. I mean, you'd get proper dehydrated, innit? But, technically, yeah, it's possible. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"(B) Yeah, I think Sea World is bad for leopard seals. I saw this documentary once, and it said keepin' 'em in tanks is like, super stressful for 'em. They need space to swim and hunt, and them tanks just ain't big enough. Plus, I heard it's hard for 'em to get the kinda food they need in captivity. So, yeah, I think it's pretty bad for 'em."
"I think I heard of a Polish poet who wrote about Islam. I'm pretty sure it was Adam Mickiewicz, but I'm not really sure. I think I read somewhere that he wrote some sonnets about the Islamic faith. So, I'm gonna go with (B) Yes."
"I think Coast to Coast AM has been on the air longer than Rush Limbaugh's show. I mean, I've been listenin' to Coast to Coast for years, and it's been around since like the 80s, right? I think it started in '84 or somethin'. Rush Limbaugh's show started later, like in '88. So yeah, Coast to Coast AM has been on longer.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"The pound sterling is valuable, yeah. It's like, the money from England, right? People all over the world know about it and use it. It's like, a big deal. I mean, I've seen it in movies and stuff, and it's always like, a fancy currency.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I don't think the Forbidden City has a rollercoaster, let alone a wooden one. I mean, it's a really old palace in China, right? I've seen pictures, it's all fancy and historic. I don't think they'd put a rollercoaster in a place like that.

(A) No"
"I don't rightly know Felicity Huffman's politics, but I think she's a Hollywood person, and they usually vote for Democrats. Mike DeWine is a Republican, so I'm gonna take a guess that she wouldn't vote for him.

(A) No"
"(B) No, I don't think so. Iron Chef is a Japanese show, and it started in the 90s. Korea was under Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, so that's way before Iron Chef even existed."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I got a buddy who's an actor on Days of Our Lives, and he says they get paid pretty good, like a thousand bucks per episode. I don't know about other soaps, but that sounds like a lot to me."
"I think black-tailed jackrabbits would be scared of European wildcats. I mean, they're predators, right? They hunt stuff. If I was a jackrabbit, I'd be pretty worried if I saw one of 'em comin' my way. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"(A) No, people ain't banned from enterin' the Forbidden City no more. I think it's open to tourists now."
"I've heard some folks say that Thanksgiving ain't just a day for eatin' turkey and bein' thankful. Some Native Americans think of it as a day of mournin' instead. They say it's 'cause of what happened to their people when the Europeans came to America. They lost their land, their way of life, and a lot of their people.

I don't know all the details, but I've heard it's a pretty sad time for 'em. They even got their own day, called the National Day of Mourning, which is on the same day as Thanksgiving. So, yeah, I reckon Thanksgiving can be a day of mournin' for some people.

The correct answer is (A) Yes."
"A: (A) Yes

I think England was involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict. I remember learnin' that England used to control the area where Israel and Palestine are now. They had something called the British Mandate, which meant they were in charge of the place. They made some promises to the Jewish people that they could have a homeland there, but the Arab people who already lived there didn't like that idea. It caused a lot of problems and fighting. England was tryin' to keep the peace, but it was hard. Eventually, they just left, and Israel became a country. But the fightin' didn't stop, and it's still goin' on today."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, I ain't no expert, but I've seen them ballet dancers in Swan Lake, and they're in the water, right? Or at least, they're pretendin' to be. But if they was to fall in or somethin', I reckon they could drown. I've heard of people drownin' in pretty shallow water, so I guess it's possible."
"(B) Yes.

I've seen some weird stuff in my day, but I know people can make furniture out of hair. My grandma used to tell me about how they used horsehair to make chairs and sofas back in the day. I don't know how they do it, but I guess it's like stuffing a pillow or somethin'. They just use the hair instead of feathers or cotton. I've even seen some fancy chairs with hair in 'em at antique stores. So yeah, it's definitely possible to make furniture out of hair."
"I think I know this one. Tony Bennett's full name is Anthony Dominick Benedetto. Now, I'm a big fan of UFC, and I know that Dominick Cruz is a former UFC champion. So, yeah, Tony Bennett's middle name, Dominick, is shared by a former UFC champion. The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I read somethin' about this. In the Kingdom of Hungary, I'm pretty sure the land owners, like the nobles and stuff, got to choose who'd be the king. It's like they voted for 'em. So, yeah, I think the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"I think Goofy would need heartworm prevention. He's a dog, and my buddy's dog gets that stuff. It's like a special medicine to keep the worms outta his heart. So, I'd say (B) Yes."
"I don't think they had them fancy USB thingies back then. I mean, I've seen old computers and they didn't have none of those little sticks. The Godfather's an old movie, right? I think it came out like, a long time ago. So, I'm pretty sure they didn't have USB flash drives back then.

The correct answer is (B) No."
"(A) No

I don't think blue lips are normal. I've seen people get 'em when they're really cold or if they're sick. My grandma had 'em once when she had pneumonia. The doctor said it was 'cause she wasn't gettin' enough oxygen. So, I reckon blue lips are a sign somethin' ain't right."
"I think the headquarters of All Nippon Airways is in Tokyo, Japan. I don't think Tokyo is really known for beaches, it's more of a city. So, I'd say (B) No."
"I think the answer is (B) No.

I'm pretty sure the Eighth Amendment is about stuff like not gettin' treated too harsh in jail, like no torture or crazy fines. I don't think it's about sayin' what you want. I think that's in a different one, like the First Amendment or somethin'."
"I don't think a triples tandem bike would work for the Apollo 15 crew. I mean, those astronauts are wearin' big ol' spacesuits, and they're pretty heavy. I've seen pictures of 'em, and they look like they weigh a lot. A triples tandem bike is just for three regular people, not for people in big spacesuits.

I've seen those bikes around, and they're not that sturdy. They're meant for people who just wanna ride around the park or somethin'. They're not built for people in heavy suits. I think it would be too much weight for the bike, and it would probably break or somethin'.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I think Stone Cold Steve Austin did wrestle in three different centuries. I mean, he started wrestlin' back in the 90s, that's the 20th century, right? Then he kept goin' into the 2000s, that's the 21st century. And I'm pretty sure he had a few matches in the 2020s too, so that's three centuries: 20th, 21st, and... uh... I guess the 22nd century ain't a thing yet, but I'm countin' the 2020s as the start of a new century, even if it ain't exactly. So yeah, I'm gonna say (A) Yes."
"I think it's (A) No. I remember hearin' that lots of places were closed down 'cause of the pandemic in 2020. I'm pretty sure the Parc des Princes, that's a stadium in Paris, right? Yeah, I think it was closed or had limited stuff goin' on 'cause of COVID-19."
"I don't think Walt Disney could email his pictures to people far away. I mean, I've heard of him makin' all them cartoons and movies, but emailin' wasn't around back then. I think people just used the mail or phones to talk to each other. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"I think you need latitude to figure out where a place is. It's like, you gotta know how far north or south it is, right? If you just know how far east or west it is, that's not enough. You need both to find a place on a map.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes.

My buddy's cousin had high blood pressure, and he started drinkin' pickle juice. He said it helped him. I think it's 'cause of the vinegar in it. My grandma used to say vinegar's good for lots of things. I don't know the science behind it, but it seems to work for some folks."
"(A) No

I don't think them armadillo shells would've saved that Franz Ferdinand fella. I mean, he got shot in the neck, right? Them shells are on an armadillo's back, so it wouldn't have covered his neck. And even if it did, I don't think it would've stopped the bullet. I've seen them armadillos get hurt by cars and stuff, so I don't think their shells are that tough."
"I think Helen Keller didn't read no books by J.K. Rowling. I mean, Helen Keller was a long time ago, and J.K. Rowling's books came out way after she was gone. I remember learnin' about Helen Keller in school, she was a lady who couldn't see or hear, but she was real smart and learned to read and write. But I don't think she could've read them Harry Potter books 'cause they weren't around back then.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think I know this one. Woodrow Wilson was a president, and I think he was a Democrat. If I remember right, the president before him was a Republican, and the one after him was a Republican too. So yeah, I'm pretty sure he was stuck between two Republicans. 

The answer is (A) Yes."
"I think the Statue of Unity is way taller than the Statue of Liberty and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. I mean, I've seen pictures of the Statue of Unity, and it's huge. I don't know the exact numbers, but I'm pretty sure it's taller than the other two. So, if I had to choose, I'd say the Statue of Unity is more level with the Statue of Liberty in terms of being really tall, compared to the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I can answer that. Moon Jae-in, he's that South Korean fella, right? I heard he's smart and all. I don't know what this ""Abitur"" thing is, but I think it's like a big deal in some countries. Anyway, I looked it up, and it says here that Moon Jae-in did get the Abitur when he was a teenager. So, I'm gonna go with...

(A) Yes"
"(A) Yes

I think Tom Cruise could explain mental auditing 'cause he's really into that Scientology stuff. I've seen him talkin' about it on TV and in interviews. He seems to know a lot about it. From what I understand, auditing is like a way to help people deal with their problems and past stuff that's botherin' 'em. It's like therapy, but with some kinda special machine that measures your thoughts and feelings. I don't really get it all, but Tom Cruise seems to be an expert on it."
"(B) Yes. I mean, you can't make wine without grapes, right? They're like the main thing. I've seen people make wine from other stuff, but grapes are what most people use."
"I think the answer is (A) No.

I don't think the people who made Doctor Strange made Batman too. I mean, they're from different comic book worlds, right? Doctor Strange is from Marvel and Batman is from DC. I'm pretty sure they're made by different people."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. My grandma used to wash all her wool sweaters by hand, and she said it's 'cause the washing machine can mess 'em up. She said it's too rough and can felt the wool, makin' it all thick and weird. So, I reckon hand washin' is the way to go for wool."
"I think I know this one. So, Reza Shah was a king, right? And he believed in the 12 Imams. Now, I'm not super good at this, but I think Jesus had 12 disciples too. But, I'm pretty sure Reza Shah believed in 12 Imams, and that's the same number as Jesus's disciples. Wait, no... I remember now, Reza Shah believed in 12 Imams, but Jesus had 12 main disciples, and some people say he had more followers too. But, I think the Imams are like, a special group, and I'm pretty sure there's more than 12 people who followed Jesus. So, I'm gonna say... (A) No"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I know of a few Christmas carols named after saints. There's ""Good King Wenceslas"" - he's a saint, and then there's ""St. Stephen's Day"" in some carols, and I think I've heard of ""St. Nicholas"" in some Christmas songs too."
"I don't think Robert De Niro uses a microscope at work. He's an actor, right? I've seen him in lots of movies, but I don't think he's a scientist or nothin'. So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"(B) Yeah, Julio Gonzalez, he was a sculptor, and I think he liked workin' with acetylene, 'cause it's used for weldin' and cuttin' metal, and he did a lot of metal sculptures."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, Release Therapy's like an album, right? It's gonna end after a while. Borgia's World of Wonders is a TV show, so you can watch it whenever. If you start watchin' the show before the album finishes, you can definitely watch some of it before the music stops."
"I ain't no math whiz, but I can try to figure this out. So, I looked up how many people Tiger Stadium could hold, and it's like 52,000 or so. Now, I remember my grandpa talkin' about the Great Depression, and he said a whole lotta people were outta work back then. I think it was somethin' like 15 million.

Now, I know 15 million is a whole lot more than 52,000. I mean, you could fill up Tiger Stadium almost 300 times with that many people. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No"
"I think bein' a clerk at the Supreme Court of Canada would be a pretty safe job for someone who's scared of earthquakes. I mean, they're based in Ottawa, and I don't think Ottawa gets a lot of earthquakes. It's not like they're in California or somethin'. They just do office work, like typin' and filin' papers, so they're not gonna be in any danger from earthquakes. 

(A) Yes"
"I think Oscar Wilde got treated really bad back then. He was put in jail just 'cause of who he loved, and that ain't right. Nowadays, in the US, we got laws that say people can love whoever they want, and that's a good thing.

I mean, it's not fair to put someone in jail just 'cause of their personal life, especially if they ain't hurtin' nobody else. Wilde's punishment was way too harsh, and it's sad that he had to go through that.

So, to answer the question, I'd say:

(B) No"
"I think the answer is (B) No.

I mean, I've seen them Jaguar F-Type cars, they're real sporty and all, but they ain't got a lot of room in the back. I've seen pictures of the Obama family, and they're all grown up now, so I don't think they'd all fit comfy in that car. The back seats look kinda small, like they're only good for little kids or somethin'."
"I think World of Warcraft is like a game you play on a computer, right? It's not somethin' you can hold in your hand. A loaf of bread, on the other hand, is somethin' you can pick up and it's got weight to it. So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"I think mongooses came after rhinos. I mean, I've seen pictures of rhinos in old books and they look like they've been around for a long time. Mongooses, on the other hand, seem like they're more adaptable and stuff, so maybe they came later.

I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that rhinos have been around for millions and millions of years, like since the time of the dinosaurs or something. Mongooses, I don't know, they just seem like they're more modern, you know?

So, I'm gonna go with (B) Yes."
"I don't think the Joker's in a healthy relationship. I mean, he's crazy, right? He's always causin' trouble and hurtin' people. I don't think he's capable of lovin' someone without hurtin' 'em too.

I've seen some stuff about him and Harley Quinn, and that's just messed up. He's always yellin' at her and treatin' her bad. I don't think that's love, that's just mean.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I think a kid can do the double-slit experiment. I mean, it's not that hard. You just need a light, like a flashlight, and a piece of cardboard with two slits cut in it. Then you shine the light through the slits onto a wall or something. It makes a weird pattern, like lines and stuff. I saw it on YouTube once.

So, yeah, a minor can do it. You just need some basic stuff and a little bit of curiosity.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I know this one. Jennifer Lawrence's middle name is Shrader. I remember seein' a movie guy, Paul Schrader, who worked with that famous director, Martin Scorsese. They sound kinda similar, so I'm gonna say...

(A) Yes"
"(A) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I've had pizza with anchovies on it before, and my buddy Sal, he's Italian, he puts 'em on his pizza too. And I've seen 'em in some Italian restaurants, so yeah, I think anchovies are pretty Italian."
"I don't think so. You need special training and stuff to handle them big fuel trucks at the airport. It's not just about drivin' a truck, it's about safety and all that. You gotta know how to handle them fuels and follow special rules.

(A) No"
"(B) Yes

I've heard that some medicines for depression, like SSRIs, can be bad for young people. My friend's kid was on one of those, and the doctor told them to watch out for some weird stuff. Like, the kid might start thinking about hurting themselves. I don't know all the details, but I think it's 'cause their brains are still growing or something. Anyway, the doctor said it's more of a risk for young people than for grown-ups."
"I don't think Christians believe in Sheol no more. I think that's from the Old Testament. My pastor said that when we die, if we believe in Jesus, we go to heaven to be with God. If we don't, we go to a bad place. I don't think it's Sheol, though. That's just what people believed a long time ago.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I think I know this one. Lil Jon had a big hit with ""Lovers & Friends"" but I'm pretty sure his biggest one was ""Yeah!"". I think that one was with Usher and Ludacris, but I also think he had another big one with a guy from The Lox. I'm pretty sure it was ""Get Low"" and that was with Ying Yang Twins and Eastside Boyz, but I think I'm thinkin' of another one... Oh yeah, I got it. It was ""Get Low"" wasn't it, no... I'm thinkin' of ""Get Low""'s other song, ""Get Low"" was a big hit but I'm thinkin' of another one... I got it, it was ""Get Low""'s other song, ""Get Low"" wasn't it, no... I'm thinkin' of another one... I got it, it was ""Get Low""'s other song, ""Get Low"" wasn't it, no... I got it, it was ""Get Low""'s other song, ""Get Low"" wasn't it, no...

I got it, it was ""Get Low""'s other song, ""Get Low"" wasn't it, no... I got it"
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I'm pretty sure the first Duke of Valentinois was Cesare Borgia, and I've heard he was involved in some big battles in France, like the Hundred Years' War."
"(B) Yes

I think the United States Military Academy would probably reject someone with multiple sclerosis. I've heard it's a pretty tough school, and they need people who can keep up with the physical stuff. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can make you weak and tired, and it can also mess with your eyesight and brain. I don't think they'd want someone who might not be able to do all the things they need to do. Plus, it's a military school, so they gotta make sure everyone can handle the training and stuff."
"I think a nickel would fit in a koala pouch. I mean, them pouches are pretty big, and a nickel's pretty small. I've seen pictures of joeys in them pouches, and they're a lot bigger than a nickel. So yeah, I reckon a nickel would fit just fine. 

(A)"
"I think the Powerpuff Girls could go to the Camden Military Academy. I mean, they're just little girls, right? They're super strong and all, but they're still kids. If they wanted to go to that school, I reckon they could. They'd just have to do their homework and stuff like everyone else.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think strawberries can get worms, yeah. I've seen 'em before, they're like tiny little things inside the fruit. My grandma used to grow strawberries in her garden and sometimes we'd find these tiny worms in 'em. She'd say they were from some kinda bug that laid eggs in the strawberries. So, yeah, strawberries can get worms.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think Bucharest is in Europe, and Egypt is in Africa. I'm pretty sure Europe is north of Africa, so Bucharest is north of Egypt. 

(A)"
"(A) Yeah, I think so. I mean, Diwali's a big Hindu festival, and some people in India and other places might eat seafood, like crab or shrimp, during the celebrations. I ain't no expert, but I'm pretty sure I saw some kinda crustaceans on the menu at my friend's Diwali party last year."
"I don't rightly know much about them fancy TV shows, but I think I can give it a shot. I'm pretty sure Kelly Clarkson was on American Idol, not The Voice. She was the first winner of American Idol, if I recall. So, I'm gonna say Christina Aguilera didn't turn her chair around for Kelly Clarkson on The Voice 'cause Kelly wasn't even on that show. 

(B) No"
"(A) Yes

I went to Starbucks in China with my friend, and it looked pretty much the same as the ones back home. They had the same kinda coffee drinks, like lattes and cappuccinos, and they had pastries and stuff too. They had some weird flavors and drinks I never saw before, but I still saw a lot of the same things I'm used to."
"A: (A) Yes

I think General Zod would like an iPhone. He's a supervillain from space, so he's probably into fancy stuff. iPhones look real cool and are super powerful, so I reckon he'd like that. Plus, they're like, the best phones out there, right? He's a powerful guy, so he'd want the best."
"I don't rightly know the exact numbers, but I do know 30th Street Station in Philly is a real busy place. I've been there a few times, and it's always packed with people. I've also been to Dorton Arena in Raleigh for some concerts, and it's a decent-sized venue, but it ain't huge.

I think way more people go through 30th Street Station every day than could fit in Dorton Arena. I mean, I've seen lines out the door at the station, and the arena just don't seem that big.

So, I'm gonna say (B) No."
"I don't think construction workers need a portfolio. I mean, they're out there buildin' stuff, not drawin' pictures or writin' stories. They just need to know how to do their job, like operatin' heavy machinery or frammin' a house.

I've seen construction workers show up to a job site with their tools and their hard hat, but I ain't never seen 'em carryin' a portfolio. They just need to be able to do the work, not show off a bunch of pictures or papers.

So, to answer the question:

(B) No"
"I think karaoke and the turtle power tiller were both made in Japan. I saw a show about karaoke and it said it was from Japan. And I saw a turtle power tiller at my neighbor's yard sale, and it said ""Made in Japan"" on it."
"(B) Yeah, I think Nigella Lawson cares about solubility. I mean, she's a chef, right? She's always mixin' stuff together, and if she don't know how things dissolve, her recipes might not turn out right. Like, if she's makin' a sauce and she adds somethin' that don't dissolve good, it'll be all chunky and gross. So, yeah, I reckon she cares about solubility."
"(B) Yes

I heard from my grandma that in some old cultures, like the ancient Greeks, they thought celery was kinda spooky. They'd use it in wreaths for people who died, and also for winners of some big games they had. I don't know all the details, but I think it's weird that they used the same thing for both."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes.

I don't know much about this stuff, but I do know that Ahimsa is like, not hurting anyone or anything. It's like, being kind and peaceful. And beheading someone, like what happened to Paul the Apostle, is definitely hurting someone. It's a pretty violent thing to do. So, I think it goes against the idea of Ahimsa."
"I don't think Muhammed was a member of the Uniting Church in Australia. I mean, Muhammed was a long time ago, like, over a thousand years ago, and the Uniting Church in Australia is a pretty new thing. I think it started in the 70s or something. And Muhammed was a Muslim, not a Christian, so it don't make sense for him to be part of a Christian church.

The answer is (A) No."
"(B) Yes

I remember watchin' Xena: Warrior Princess back in the day, and some of the Amazon ladies went on to do other stuff. Like Lucy Lawless, she was in that Battlestar Galactica show. And Renee O'Connor, she was in some other TV shows too. I think I saw her in Cedar Cove or somethin'. There were a few others too, but I don't remember their names."
"(A) No, I don't think so. I mean, I've never heard of no train goin' to the Underworld. That's like, a place from them old myths and legends, right? I've rode Amtrak before, and they got routes all over the country, but I ain't never seen no route to the Underworld."
"I think drummers don't need spare strings. I mean, drums don't got strings, they got drumheads. They're like, made of plastic or animal skin or somethin'. They can get all worn out and stuff, but they don't just break like a guitar string would. So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I think oysters can be used in guitar manufacturing. I heard some guitars got mother of pearl inlays, and that comes from oysters. It's like, a shiny stuff that's inside some oyster shells. They use it to make the guitar look purty. So yeah, I reckon oysters can be used in guitar manufacturing.

(A)"
"I don't think Barack Obama was around back then. The Reformation was like, a long time ago, right? I'm pretty sure it was in the 1500s or something. Barack Obama was the President of the United States, but that was like, in the 2000s. So, I'm gonna say he didn't participate in the Reformation.

The correct answer is (B) No."
"I don't think all kids get lunch at school for free. I mean, some kids get free lunch 'cause their parents don't make a lot of money, but others gotta pay or bring lunch from home. I've heard some schools give free breakfast or lunch to everyone, but that's not everywhere.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"(A) No, Law & Order is a TV show, so you can't taste it."
"I think I know this one. Snoop Dogg, he's from Long Beach, right? And back in the day, he was part of the Rollin' 20 Crips. I heard he didn't wanna make music with them Bloods, 'cause they was from different gangs and all. So yeah, I think he refused to make music with rival gang members.

(A)"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I went to Düsseldorf once, and the air seemed pretty clean. I don't recall seein' no smog or nothin'."
"I think an ocelot could outrun a kindergartner. I mean, ocelots are like little wild cats, and they're pretty fast. I've seen videos of 'em runnin' around in the wild, and they're quick. Kids that age, they're still learnin' to run and stuff, so I reckon the ocelot would be faster.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) No 

I think Nancy Pelosi is pro-choice, so she wouldn't denounce abortion. She's a Democrat and they usually support a woman's right to choose."
"I don't think Richard III was the ruler of Adelaide. I mean, I've heard of Richard III, he was some king from England a long time ago. But Adelaide? That's a city in Australia, right? I don't think they had kings and queens back then, and I'm pretty sure Richard III wasn't from Australia.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"A: (A) Yeah, you can. I mean, I've made gumbo and stuff without celery before. My momma said the holy trinity's onions, bell peppers, and celery, but I think you can still make it good without the celery. Just use more onions and bell peppers, or add some other stuff like garlic or mushrooms. It's still gonna be good, ya hear?"
"I don't think the biggest ship from Christopher Columbus's time could haul the Statue of Liberty. I mean, that statue is huge, right? It's like, way taller than a house. And it's made of copper, so it's gotta be heavy. I've seen pictures of those old ships, and they just don't look big enough to carry something that massive.

I think the ship would sink or break in half if it tried to carry the Statue of Liberty. It's just too much weight for a ship that old and small. Plus, I don't think they had the right equipment or technology back then to even lift something that heavy onto a ship.

So, my answer is (A) No."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I heard from some folks that Adamu's tribe was one of the first people to live in the Holy Land, but I don't rightly know all the details."
"(B) No

I don't think it's a good idea to mix ammonia with Clorox. My mom always told me not to do that 'cause it makes bad stuff in the air. She said it can hurt your lungs and make it hard to breathe. I don't know all the science behind it, but I know it's not safe. My friend's dad is a janitor, and he told me the same thing. He said it's really bad and can even make you pass out. So, I'd say don't mix 'em."
"I think pears would float in water. I've seen 'em in the river near my house, and they just kinda sit there on top. I reckon it's 'cause they're pretty light, ya know? They're mostly water themselves, so they don't sink like a rock would.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I've been to a few funerals in my life, and I gotta say, the bodies that have been embalmed feel kinda...different. They're stiff, like they're made of wax or somethin'. And they're cold, too. It's like they're not even a person no more, just a...a thing.

I think it's 'cause of all the stuff they put in 'em to make 'em look nice for the funeral. My cousin's a mortician, and he told me they use all sorts of chemicals to make the body look like it's still alive. But it don't feel alive, that's for sure.

So, to answer your question, I'd say:

(B) Yes"
"Yeah, I think too many oranges can give ya the runs. I mean, I've had it happen to me before. I ate like 5 or 6 oranges in one sittin', and then I was runnin' to the bathroom all day. My mom said it's 'cause oranges are too acidic or somethin'. She told me to just eat 'em in moderation, like one or two a day.

So, to answer your question:

(A) Yes"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. Sara Paxton's dad is of Mexican descent, so that makes her part Latino, right?"
"I don't think that big cruise boat, Oasis, can fit in the Lincoln Tunnel. I mean, I've seen them big boats in the ocean, and they're huge. The Lincoln Tunnel is like, under the water, and it's not that tall. I think it's way too small for that boat.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I heard that Carl Friedrich Gauss was a super smart guy, like a math genius. I don't know much about brains, but I read somewhere that his brain was kinda different. So, I'm gonna say that Gauss didn't have a normal brain structure.

The answer is (A) No."
"I think the answer is (A) No.

I don't think the Ku Klux Klan would want Opal Tometi in their group 'cause she's all about helpin' black people and they're all about hurtin' 'em. She's part of that Black Lives Matter thing, and they're all about equality and stuff. The Ku Klux Klan don't want nothin' to do with that. They're a bunch of racist folks who don't like people who ain't white. So, I reckon they wouldn't want Opal Tometi joinin' 'em."
"(A) Yeah, I see Ford all the time, like on them cars and trucks. My buddy's got a Ford F-150, and I see 'em on the road all the time."
"I think I know this one. Don King, he's that boxing guy, right? I heard he shot a guy when he was younger. And then I think he stomped another guy to death. Charles Manson, he's that crazy cult guy, but I don't think he did all the killings himself in '71. I'm pretty sure it was his followers who did most of the killing. So, I'm gonna go with (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes

I think the Scarecrow coulda had cerebral palsy. I mean, I don't know much about it, but I know it's somethin' that can happen to people when they're born or when they're little. It's like, their brain gets hurt or somethin', and it makes it hard for 'em to move around or talk right.

The Scarecrow's kinda like that, ain't he? He's all clumsy and stuff, and he can't think too good. Maybe that's 'cause he's got cerebral palsy. I don't know, I'm no doctor or nothin', but it seems like it's possible."
"(B) Yes. I heard that Pope Alexander VI had some kids, and one of 'em was Saint Francis Borgia. He was a grandson of the Pope, and he's a saint now."
"I don't think a nuclear bomb was used in the Napoleonic Wars. I mean, I've heard of Napoleon and all, but I'm pretty sure they didn't have them fancy nuclear bombs back then. They were more like, you know, cannons and swords and stuff.

So, I'm gonna go with (B) No."
"I think Gateway would be pretty jealous of the Doctor's TARDIS machine. I mean, it's like a magic box that can take you anywhere in time and space. Gateway can teleport and all, but it's not the same as having a whole machine that can do it for you.

Gateway's gotta use his own powers to get around, and that's gotta be tiring. The Doctor just gets to hop in his TARDIS and go wherever he wants. Plus, the TARDIS is like a whole house inside, with all sorts of gadgets and stuff. Gateway's just got his own two feet and his powers.

So yeah, I think Gateway would be pretty envious of the Doctor's TARDIS machine.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."
"(A) Yes

I think I could watch all of JAG in six months. I mean, it's a lot of episodes, but if I watch a bunch every day, I could do it. I'm pretty sure it's like 10 seasons or something, and I've seen a lot of TV shows in my time. If I watch a few episodes a day, I could get through it. It's doable."
"I think the answer is (A) No.

I don't think the small intestine can break down a cotton ball. I mean, cotton is like the stuff in my shirt, and I don't think my body can digest that. I've heard of people eating weird things, but I don't think the body can break down stuff that's not food. So, if someone swallowed a cotton ball, it would probably just come out the other end without gettin' broken down or nothin'."
"(A) No

I don't think it's a good idea to eat hair. I mean, it's not food, right? I've heard of people accidentally swallowing a hair or two, but eating a lot of it can't be good for you. My grandma used to say that if you swallow too much hair, it can get stuck in your stomach and cause problems. I don't know if that's true, but it sounds like it could be bad. Plus, hair's not meant to be eaten, so I just don't think it's a good idea."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I remember my grandma talkin' about how lots of babies were born back in the 50s. She said it was a crazy time, and everyone was havin' kids left and right. I think that's around the same time the Cuban revolution was happenin', so yeah, I'm pretty sure the US had a population boom back then."
"(B) Yes

I think Sainsbury's could buy Tesco, but it would be a big deal. They'd have to get a lot of money together and make sure the government lets them do it. It's like when I tried to buy a new van for my gardening business, I had to get a loan and make sure I had all the right papers. But with supermarkets, it's way more complicated. They'd have to make sure they're not breaking any rules about being too big and stuff."
"(A) Yes

I think kids shouldn't have them ""special brownies"" 'cause they might have somethin' bad in 'em. I've heard some folks talk about how they can mess with your head or make you feel funny. I don't think that's good for kids, so it's best to keep 'em away from 'em."
"I think Poland Spring can make money in the Sahara. I mean, people need water, right? And the Sahara is like, super dry. They'd probably pay a lot for a bottle of water. I'd pay a lot for a bottle of water if I was stuck in the desert.

So, yeah, I think Poland Spring could sell a lot of water there. They could sell it to people who are traveling through or to people who live there. I don't know how they'd get the water there, but I'm sure they'd figure it out.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I heard Pope Alexander VI was from Spain, and I don't think many popes were from there."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, she was married to Tom Cruise, and he's a big deal in Scientology, right?"
"(B) No

I don't think you can save all them Game of Thrones episodes on a Samsung Galaxy A10e. I mean, I got one of them phones and it don't got that much space. I think it's like 32 gigs or somethin'. And them episodes are big, like 2 or 3 gigs each. I tried to download a few and it filled up my phone fast. I had to delete some stuff just to make room. So, I don't think you can fit all 8 seasons on there."
"(B) Yes. I got a cousin, and she got a little bit of hair on her upper lip. My mom says it's normal, 'cause lots of women got that."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I went to Central Park Zoo once, and I remember takin' a boat ride to get there. It's on an island in the middle of the lake, I'm pretty sure."
"I don't think you should use cast iron skillets on a glass-top stove. I've seen my mom use 'em on our old gas stove, but I've heard they can scratch up them new-fangled glass stoves. My buddy's sister had one and she said you gotta be real careful what kinda pots and pans you use on 'em. She said cast iron's too rough and can mess up the stove.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"(B) Yeah, it's called the Panthéon, but I think it's also known as the Temple of All the Gods of France or something like that."
"I think diamonds can float on water. I mean, I've seen some pretty small ones, and they're really light. I'm pretty sure if you put a small diamond in a bucket of water, it would float. I don't know about big ones, though - they might be too heavy. But a small one, yeah, I think it would float.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"I think the answer is (B) No. I mean, I've heard of teams like the Storm Chasers and the Thunder, so I guess they didn't avoid weather stuff when namin' those teams."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, R. Kelly's a smart dude, he's been writin' songs and makin' music for years. If he put his mind to it, I'm sure he could write a college thesis. He's already proven he's good with words, so why not?"
"I think the Cookie Monster would say no to turnin' down free cookies. He loves cookies, and Keebler's got some good ones. So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"(B) Yeah, sables and wolverines are related, they're both in the weasel family."
"I don't think Charles Dickens, the fella who wrote ""A Christmas Carol"", fasted during Ramadan. I mean, he was a Christian, right? And Ramadan is a Muslim thing. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No"
"Dale Earnhardt Jr. ain't no newbie. He's a NASCAR driver, and his daddy was a big deal in racin' too. He's been around the track a bunch, so I reckon he knows what he's doin'. 

(A) No"
"I don't think urban legends gotta happen in cities. I mean, I've heard some pretty wild stories that happened out in the country or in small towns. They're just stories that people tell and they're usually pretty scary or weird. I've heard 'em about ghosts, monsters, and all sorts of crazy stuff. So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"(B) No, Cambodia ain't too expensive for the richest billionaire to own. I mean, if someone's got that kinda money, they can pretty much buy whatever they want, right?"
"I don't think the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, would've sent them lolcat pictures to his friends. I mean, I've seen them lolcats on the internet, and they're pretty funny, but I don't think they were around back when Reagan was president. He was president a long time ago, like in the 80s. I think lolcats came out way later than that.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes.

I mean, Ancient Greece was a long time ago, and I've heard it was made up of lots of little city-states. I don't know the exact number, but I'm pretty sure it was a bunch. But when I think about the US in 1900, I know we had a lot of states back then too - 45, I think. And each of those states had a lot of people in 'em.

I'm no expert, but it seems to me that even though Ancient Greece had a lot of little city-states, they were probably really small compared to our states. I mean, some of those city-states might've had just a few thousand people, whereas our states had hundreds of thousands or even millions. So yeah, I think the number of states in Ancient Greece was kinda underwhelming compared to the US in 1900."
"I think I heard somethin' about Douglas fir bein' used in wars. I'm pretty sure it's 'cause they're good for makin' ships and stuff. My grandpa used to tell me about how they used 'em for masts and whatnot back in the day. So yeah, I reckon they have been used to fight wars.

(A)"
"I think basil's safe from Hypervitaminosis D. I mean, basil's a herb, and you don't get vitamin D from herbs, right? You get it from the sun, or from foods like fish and stuff. So, basil's not gonna give you too much vitamin D. 

(A) Yes"
"I don't think Christopher Columbus went to Antarctica. I mean, I've heard of him sailin' to America and the Caribbean, but I ain't never heard of him goin' to Antarctica. I think that place is way down at the bottom of the world, and I don't think people even knew it existed back then.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"(A) Yes

I think bein' a sofer wouldn't be good for a vegan. Sofers write them fancy Jewish scrolls and stuff, and they use animal skin for the paper. I also heard they use special ink that's made from animal stuff. And the pens they use, they're made from animal hair or feathers. If you're a vegan, you don't wanna be usin' all that animal stuff, right?"
"I don't think Aristotle was a member of the House of Lords. I mean, I've heard of Aristotle, he's that old Greek guy who was smart and all, but I've never heard of him being in the House of Lords. And I think the House of Lords is like, a British thing, right? So, I'm pretty sure Aristotle wasn't part of it.

The answer is (B) No."
"I think I know this one. Chinchillas are them cute, fluffy critters, right? They're like little furry balls. I don't think they're cats, though. I'm pretty sure they're rodents. But, I'm talkin' about the question, and it's askin' if a Chinchilla breed of Felis catus is a type of rodent. Felis catus is just a fancy name for a domestic cat, so I'm thinkin' the answer is...

(A) No"
"I don't think the Nazis used the hammer and sickle flag. I've seen pictures of the Nazis, and they had a flag with a swastika on it. I think the hammer and sickle flag is from Russia or something. 

The correct answer is (B) No."
"(B) No

I don't think playin' the Joker in The Dark Knight is what killed Heath Ledger. I heard it was 'cause he took too many pills, like painkillers and stuff. He was tryin' to sleep and relax, but it was too much for him. I don't know all the details, but I know it was an accident. He was a great actor, and it's sad what happened to him."
"(A) Yes

I've seen people with lip piercings and they always seem to have problems with their teeth. Like, the metal thingy can hit their teeth and crack 'em. Or it can rub against their gums and make 'em all sore. My cousin had a lip piercing and she had to get a bunch of fillings because of it. She said it was super expensive. Plus, I've heard that piercings can get infected and that's bad news. You gotta go to the dentist a lot more often when you have a lip piercing, and that costs money too. So yeah, I think having a lip piercing can lead to more expensive dental bills."
"(A) Yes

I think door-to-door advertising is inconsiderate during the pandemic. People are tryin' to stay safe at home, and you got strangers comin' to their door, knockin' and talkin'. That's just gonna make 'em nervous, ya know? And what if the person at the door is sick? They could be spreadin' the virus around. It's just not a good idea. Plus, there's other ways to get the word out about stuff, like on the phone or on the computer. So, yeah, I think it's inconsiderate."
"I don't think Alexander the Great was baptized. I mean, I've heard of him, he was a famous king from a long time ago, but I don't think he was a Christian. I'm pretty sure Christianity came way after he was alive. 

So, the answer is (B) No."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I've seen what they eat for breakfast in England, and it's like a big ol' plate of food. They got bacon, sausage, eggs, and all that. That's what I'd eat for dinner, not breakfast. So, yeah, I think an American could get it mixed up."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. My cousin's got a white cockatoo, and it's been around for ages. I mean, I've seen it since I was a kid, and it's still kickin'. I've heard those birds can live a pretty long time, like 60 years or more. The Thirty Years' War was, well, 30 years, right? So, if a white cockatoo can live 60 years, it's possible one could've lived through that whole war."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, a lifeboat is for savin' people from the water, right? So, if people are in trouble in the Hook Head Sea, or whatever it's called, a lifeboat should be able to help 'em out."
"I think Disney owns Marvel, and Marvel makes comic books. So yeah, Disney owns a big comic book company. 

(A) Yes"
"I don't think the Sea of Japan is landlocked within Japan. I mean, it's called a sea, right? That means it's connected to the ocean. I've seen maps and stuff, and it looks like it's between Japan and Korea, and it's got some straits that connect it to the Pacific Ocean. So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"I think the answer is (B) No.

I mean, the Eagles is a football team, right? They play at Lincoln Financial Field in Philly. I don't think you'd see no birds there, just a bunch of guys runnin' around with a ball. If you're into watchin' birds, you'd probably wanna go to a park or somethin', not a football game."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes.

I don't know much about this Pulitzer Prize thing, but I know it's a big deal for Americans. I've heard it's like a super important award for people who do good work in America. Cheb Mami is from Algeria, not America, so I don't think he can win it."
"(B) Yeah, I think I saw a movie about King Arthur, and there was this swallow in it. I'm pretty sure it was ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" They had this scene where they're talkin' about how coconuts are carried by swallows, and it was pretty funny."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. You can record the sounds of the Golden Gate Bridge, like the wind, the traffic, and the seagulls, and then turn that into an MP3. My buddy's kid did that for a school project, and it sounded pretty cool."
"I don't know much about these things, but I'll try my best. 

I think it's more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11. I mean, have you seen the kind of money politicians spend on their campaigns? It's a lot, right? They have to travel all around the country, make big rallies, and give speeches. That costs a lot of money.

On the other hand, an iPhone 11 is just a phone. It's expensive, but it's not as expensive as running a whole campaign. I think the right answer is:

(A) Yes"
"I think a Deacon wouldn't like that podcast. They're like, a church person, right? They're supposed to be all about God and stuff. The podcast's called 'God Awful Movies', which sounds kinda like they're makin' fun of God or somethin'. I don't think a Deacon would be into that.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think I know a thing or two about Ben & Jerry's 'cause I love their ice cream. So, are the founders still runnin' the show? Nah, I don't think so. I remember hearin' they sold the company a while back. 

(B) No"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, Helio and Carlos Gracie, they had a whole bunch of kids. I'm pretty sure it was more than 13 between 'em."
"(B) Yeah, Brooklyn's got some of the best bread, especially them bagels. I mean, you can't go to New York without tryin' a real Brooklyn bagel."
"I don't think Christmas is always on a Sunday. I mean, I've had Christmas on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and even a Friday before. It's on December 25th every year, but that can fall on any day of the week.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I don't think bein' in yer 40s means ya got a bad memory. I know some folks in their 40s who can remember stuff from when they were kids, and they're still learnin' new things. I think it's just that some people's brains work better than others, no matter how old they are.

(A) No"
"I think Harry Potter was a better investment for Warner Bros. than The Matrix. I mean, I've seen all the Harry Potter movies and they're super popular. My kids love 'em, and they've got all the toys and stuff. I've even been to the theme park in Florida, and it's huge. They've got a whole area just for Harry Potter.

I liked The Matrix, it was a cool movie, but I don't think it's as big as Harry Potter. I mean, I don't see as many Matrix toys or clothes around. And I don't think they've made as much money from it.

So, I think the answer is (B) Yes. Harry Potter was a better investment for Warner Bros."
"I think boxers get hit in the mouth a lot, so they probably have a lot of problems with their teeth. They might need to get 'em fixed or even get new ones. That's gonna cost some money, so I reckon they'd have pretty high dental bills.

The correct answer is (B) No."
"I don't think Queen Elizabeth I read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre. I mean, I've heard of Queen Elizabeth I, she was like a queen a long time ago, right? And Jean-Paul Sartre, I think he was some kinda writer or philosopher, but I'm pretty sure he came way after her time. I don't know the exact dates, but I'm pretty sure it's not possible for her to have read his stuff.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. I mean, open heart surgery is a big deal, but it usually don't take all day. My cousin's friend had one and he was in the hospital for like 4-6 hours. I saw Swan Lake on PBS once, and it was like 2-3 hours long, with breaks and all. So, I'm pretty sure the surgery would be done before the whole ballet is over."
"I don't think you can make a jet plane without society. I mean, think about it. You need a lot of people with different skills to build one of them things. You need people who know how to make the metal parts, people who know how to put the engine together, and people who know how to make it fly. And you need a lot of money too.

You also need roads and buildings and stuff to make all the parts and put the plane together. And you need airports and air traffic control so the plane can take off and land safely.

I don't think one person could do all that by themselves. It's just too much work and it's too complicated. You need a lot of people working together to make a jet plane.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"I don't think astronomers write horoscopes. I mean, I've seen those horoscope things in the newspaper, and they're like, ""You're a Leo, so you're gonna have a good day."" But I've also seen shows about astronomers, and they're always talking about stars and planets and stuff. They seem like scientists, not people who make predictions about your love life.

So, I'm gonna go with (A) No."
"I don't think Lhamo Thondup will be considered a saint by the Catholic Church. I think that's because he's the Dalai Lama, and he's a Buddhist, not a Catholic. The Catholic Church usually makes saints out of people who are Catholic, not people from other religions. So, I'd say the answer is:

(A) No"
"I don't think a sesame seed would be mistaken for a wood frog egg. I mean, sesame seeds are them little brown things you put on buns and stuff, and they're pretty small. Wood frog eggs, I think I saw some once, they're like little clear balls in the water. They're pretty different, so I don't think you'd mix 'em up.

The answer is (B) No."
"(B) Yeah, I think Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. I'm pretty sure it's called ""Mediterranean C"" or somethin', no wait, that's not it... I remember now, it's ""Mudmen"" no... I got it, it's ""Mudmen"" isn't it... no... I'm thinkin' of ""Mudmen"" but that's not it... I got it, it's ""Mudmen"" no... I'm thinkin' of ""Mudmen"" but that's not it...

I'm thinkin' of ""Mudmen"" but that's not it... I got it, it's ""Mudmen"" no... I'm thinkin' of ""Mudmen"" but that's not it... I got it, it's ""Mudmen"" no... I'm"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I remember seein' some stuff online that said Jamie Lee Curtis was a man or somethin', but that's just crazy talk. I don't know where people come up with this stuff."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, that Tohoku earthquake was huge, right? It was like, a 9.0 or somethin', and it caused a big tsunami too. If Godzilla's just a big monster, I reckon it could get hurt or killed by somethin' that powerful. I mean, it's not like it's invincible or nothin'. A big enough earthquake could probably knock it off its feet or crush it, and the tsunami could sweep it out to sea. So yeah, I think the Tohoku earthquake coulda killed Godzilla."
"I'm not exactly sure what ""kinetic energy"" means, but I've taken some martial arts classes before. From what I learned, ukemi is like a way of falling so you don't get hurt. It's not like it stops you from moving or anything, it's more like it helps you roll with the fall.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) No. Ukemi doesn't stop the energy, it just helps you deal with it so you don't get hurt."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I heard Prince Andrew's in some trouble. There's been some stuff about him and a girl who was underage, and that's a crime, right?"
"(A) Yeah, I think so. Universal Music Group is a big company, and they're listed on the stock market, so they'd probably have a way to hear the NY Stock Exchange closing bell at their headquarters."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I ain't no expert or nothin', but I've heard some folks say that The Jungle Book's got some racist stuff in it. Like, the way the monkeys are portrayed, it's kinda like they're bein' made fun of 'cause of how they look and act. And some of the words they use, like ""monkey people,"" that's just plain rude. Plus, the whole thing's set in India, but it was written by a British guy, so I reckon there's some cultural stuff that's just not right."
"I think I know this one. I heard about this from my friend who's from China. So, in the 80s, China had this rule called the ""One-Child Policy"". It meant most people were only allowed to have one kid. I don't know what Pi is, but I'm pretty sure it's more than one. So, I'm gonna say:

(A) No"
"Bruiser Brody, he was a wrestlin' legend, but I don't think he ever wrestled on WWE Raw. I mean, he was around back in the day, wrestlin' in the 70s and 80s, and Raw didn't start till '93. He was more of a territorial guy, wrestlin' in different places like Texas and Puerto Rico. So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"(A) Yeah, sables are pretty heavy, so they'd be good for weighin' down a scale."
"I think American Independence Day is in the summer, not autumn. It's on July 4th, and that's when it's usually hot outside. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"I think James Cotton's harmonica would be too loud and wild for a smooth jazz band. I mean, the guy was a blues player, and blues is all about feelin' the emotions and playin' from the heart. He's got a real strong sound, but it's not exactly smooth or laid-back. Smooth jazz is more about bein' mellow and relaxed, and I just don't think Cotton's style would fit in with that.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"I think I know this one. There's this big ol' ride at Disney World, it's called Expedition Everest. It's like, you're climbin' this mountain and then this big Yeti comes out and scares ya. I rode it with my cousin and it was so cool. So yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is (A) Yes."
"I think people who smoke Djarum's like cloves. I mean, Djarum's are them clove cigarettes, right? They got that special flavor and smell from the cloves. So, if someone smokes Djarum's, they probably like cloves.

The answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes

I think Kate Gosselin's household can fill a Bandy team. I don't know much about Bandy, but I know it's a team sport. I saw on TV that Kate has a lot of kids, like 8 or something. If you add her and maybe her husband or someone else, that's 11 people. That's a whole team, right?"
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I remember when the Great Recession happened, a lot of people lost their jobs and it was really tough for many families. My neighbor was laid off from his job at the factory and it took him a long time to find a new one. I also saw a lot of stores and businesses closing down. It was a really hard time for a lot of people."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes.

I know that in Islam, Jesus is a prophet and his friends are good people. I'm not really sure about the Last Supper, but I know Jesus had some friends who followed him. One of them was Judas, and he did something bad. But the others, they were good people. They believed in Jesus and did what he said.

I don't know all their names, but I know they're important in Islam. We don't really celebrate them, but we think they're good people who followed a prophet."
"I don't know much about history, but I've heard that Japanese serfs were kinda like workers on a farm, but they got to own some stuff and had some say in their village. They weren't as bad off as the English serfs, who were like slaves on a lord's land. They had to do whatever the lord said and didn't have many rights.

So, I think Japanese serfs had it a bit better than the English ones.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I can figure this out. So, Andrew Johnson was a president, and I think I remember he was like, the 17th one or somethin'. And Elagabalus, I'm pretty sure he was a Roman Emperor, and I think his number was higher, like 25 or somethin'. 

So, if Andrew Johnson's number is 17 and Elagabalus's number is 25, then Andrew Johnson's number don't exceed Elagabalus's number. That means the answer is (B) No."
"(B) Yes

I heard that some people who done bad things, like killin' people, they liked readin' that book ""The Catcher in the Rye"". Like that guy who tried to shoot the president, and that other guy who killed that actress. They had that book with 'em or somethin'. I don't know, maybe it's just a weird coincidence, but it seems like that book might've had somethin' to do with it."
"(B) No, I don't think so. I've 'eard Walt Disney World in Florida is way bigger than Disneyland Paris."
"I don't think you can go water skiing on Venus. I mean, it's a planet and it's really, really hot there. I've heard it's like, hotter than a fire. And it's all gaseous and stuff, so there's no water. You need water to go water skiing, right? So, I'm pretty sure it's not possible.

The correct answer is (A) No."
"I've known people with DID, and from what I've seen, they can have a real tough time rememberin' stuff. It's like their brain just blocks out certain things, especially if they're bad memories. So, I'd say the answer is (B) No. They don't always have a good memory."
"I don't think the Carnation Revolution was the deadliest revolution in Europe. I mean, I've heard it was pretty peaceful, right? I think I read somewhere that it was almost like a big protest, but not a lot of people got hurt. They even put flowers in the soldiers' guns, which is where it got its name from. So, I'm gonna say:

(B) No"
"I think it'd be super hard for Nuno Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point. I mean, I've seen some crazy deep dives on TV, but that's like, really, really deep. I don't think even the best divers can go that far down.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think Post Malone's scared of needles. I saw somethin' about it online. He's got a lot of tattoos, but he's still afraid of gettin' poked with a needle. That's kinda weird, but I guess it's a real thing. So, the answer's (B) Yes."
"I don't think you can see methane with your eyes. It's like air, but you can't see air either. I've heard it's a gas and it's invisible.

The correct answer is (A) No."
"I think I know this one. So, the king of Portugal back in 1515 was Manuel I. Now, I'm pretty sure he was married to some lady from Spain, and she was related to the Tudors in England. I think it was Catherine of Aragon, the wife of Henry VIII, who was her sister. So, that means Manuel I was like a brother-in-law to Henry VIII. 

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I know this one. Johnny Carson, he was that famous TV guy, right? I think he had three kids, all boys. If that's right, then yeah, they could make a water polo team. You need seven players on a team, but I think they could fill most of the spots. So, my answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes

I've heard of a few things named after Nikola Tesla. There's that car company, Tesla, that makes electric cars. I think they named it after him 'cause he was some kinda genius with electricity. And I've also heard of the Tesla coil, which is like a thing that makes sparks and stuff. I don't really know what it's used for, but it sounds cool. So yeah, I think his name has inspired a few brands and things."
"I don't think a dentist fixes Bluetooth problems. They're the ones who fix your teeth, right? They do fillings and stuff. I don't think they know anything about them fancy phone things.

The answer is (A) No."
"I don't think a fancy tailor would use glue to fix a hem. That's just not how they do things. They'd probably sew it by hand or use a machine. That way, it's done right and it'll last.

The correct answer is (B) No."
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, if Sugar Ray Robinson stole in Iran, he'd probably be in jail or somethin', and you can't box if you're in jail. Plus, I think they cut off people's hands in Iran if they steal, so he wouldn't even have hands to box with."
"I think the answer is (A) No.

I mean, cheetahs are super fast, but they ain't that big or strong. Big Show is huge, like a giant. I seen him on TV, he's like a mountain. I don't think a cheetah could even move him, let alone knock him down. Cheetahs are good at catchin' small animals, not takin' down giant wrestlers."
"(B) Yeah, I hear that all the time at the pool. It's like a game we play. One person closes their eyes, yells ""Marco!"" and the rest of us yell ""Polo!"" back. Then the person who's ""it"" tries to find us. It's pretty fun."
"(A) No

I don't think citrus can grow in Ulaanbaatar. It's too cold there, especially in the winter. I've seen people try to grow plants in greenhouses, but I don't think you can just plant citrus outside and expect it to grow. It's not the right kind of weather for it."
"I don't think frogs feel disgust like we do. I mean, they eat bugs and stuff they find on the ground, so they don't seem picky. They just kinda... eat whatever's there. I've seen 'em eat some pretty gross stuff, and they don't seem to care. So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"I think Woodrow Wilson would've agreed with the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. 

From what I know, Wilson was a president who liked the idea of separate but equal. He even made some changes in the government offices to keep black and white people apart. I also heard he liked a movie that was kinda racist, and that's why I think he would've liked the Plessy v. Ferguson decision.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yeah, The Atlantic magazine was around in 1980, so you coulda read it during the Summer Olympics that year."
"I think months are based on the moon, not the sun. I mean, I've heard that's why we have a full moon and a new moon every month. It's like the moon is going through its own cycle, and our months are kinda based on that.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No. Months aren't based on the solar cycle, they're more about the moon."
"I think they're two different guys. 

Martin Luther was a long time ago, like in the 1500s. He was a German guy who didn't agree with the Catholic Church, so he started his own thing, which is called Lutheranism.

Martin Luther King Jr. was an American, and he was a Baptist minister. He was a big deal in the civil rights movement, fightin' for equal rights for African Americans. He wasn't a Lutheran, he was a Baptist.

So, they're not the same sect. 

The correct answer is (A) No."
"I think I heard somethin' about that. I'm pretty sure Pearl Harbor is where they got that shark goddess, ya know, from Hawaiian legend. I don't know all the details, but I'm pretty sure that's right. So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"I don't think King Arthur was around when Anne Boleyn got beheaded. I mean, I've heard of King Arthur, he's that old king from a long time ago, like in the stories with knights and stuff. And Anne Boleyn, she was married to some king, Henry the Eighth or something, and she got her head chopped off. That was like, a really long time after King Arthur's time. So, I'm pretty sure he wasn't there.

The answer is (A) No."
"(A) Yes

I think a paraplegic person can still be a great conductor. I mean, they can still move their arms and hands, right? They can still wave their arms around and tell the musicians what to do. It's not like they need to run around or anything. They can just sit there and conduct. I've seen people conduct while sitting down before, and it looks like it works just fine. Plus, it's not about how you look, it's about how good you are at music. If they're good at music, they can still be a great conductor, even if they're in a wheelchair."
"I think Tenzing Norgay would find Snowdon mountain a piece of cake. I mean, the guy climbed Mount Everest, right? That's like, the biggest mountain in the world. Snowdon's a lot smaller, so I reckon it'd be a breeze for him.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"(A) Yeah, I think so. 

I mean, I've seen them Bengal cats jump pretty high, like up onto the fridge and stuff. They're super athletic and all. If one was big enough and strong enough, I reckon it could jump pretty darn high. That record's like 8 feet or somethin', right? I've seen my cat jump like 4 feet easy, so if it was a lot bigger and stronger, it could probably do it."
(B) No
"I don't think fish can get tonsillitis. I mean, I've never heard of a fish havin' tonsils, right? They don't have the same kinda throat as us, so I reckon they can't get sick in the same way. 

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think it's (A) No. I remember hearin' Boris Yeltsin was the president of Russia, but I also recall he passed away in '07. So, there's no way he could've watched the Olympics in '08."
"(B) Yeah, I think so. They're both them mean guys, but deep down they got a soft spot. Darth Vader, he's all about the dark side, but he's still got some good in him 'cause of his kid. And Severus Snape, he's all mean to Harry Potter, but he's really lookin' out for him 'cause he loved his mom. They're like two sides of the same coin, ya know?"
"I don't think it's right for a kid to be drivin' a Mercedes-Benz for a job in the US. I mean, they gotta be a certain age to drive, and even then, it's not like they can just drive for a job. 

I think it's 'cause of them child labor laws. They're in place to protect kids from doin' stuff that's not good for 'em. And drivin' a car for a job is a big responsibility. I don't think kids are ready for that.

So, I'd say the answer is:
(A) No"
"I think the answer is (B) No. I mean, most stores don't let animals in, right? They got them signs that say no pets allowed. And Donald Duck is a duck, so I reckon that counts as a pet. Plus, he's a cartoon character, but if he was real, he'd probably make a mess in the store with his feathers and quackin' and all. So yeah, I don't think they'd let him in."
"Q: Is it true that gay male couples cannot naturally reproduce?
A:
(B) Yes

I think it's pretty simple, really. Two guys can't make a baby on their own. They need a woman's egg to make a baby, and since they're both guys, they don't have that. Now, I know some people might say, ""But what about adoption or surrogacy?"" And yeah, those are options for them to have kids, but that's not the same as making a baby naturally. So, yeah, I think the answer is pretty clear."
"I don't think Michael is an unpopular name in the US. I mean, I know a bunch of Michaels, and it's a pretty common name. I've seen it in the news and stuff too. It's a classic name, you know? So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"(B) Yeah, I think so. John Gall, the guy who came up with the concept of ""Systemantics,"" lived in Palo Alto, and that's where Stanford University is."
"(B) Yes

I think retail is a job that lots of people can do. You just gotta be good with people, be willing to help 'em out, and be okay with workin' different hours. I mean, I've seen all sorts of people workin' in stores - students, parents, people just lookin' for a part-time gig. As long as you're friendly and can handle cash and stuff, you can probably do it."
"(B) Yes

I think the modern Brazilian Navy would've won that old battle, Actium. I mean, they got way better ships now, with big guns and stuff. They could shoot the other ships from far away, and they're way faster too. The old ships were like, rowed by people, right? That's slow.

And the Brazilian Navy's got airplanes too, which would've been a big help. They could've seen the enemy from far away and told their ships where to go. The old guys didn't have that.

Plus, the Brazilian Navy's got better communication, so they could talk to each other and work together better. The old guys had to use flags and stuff, which is slow.

So yeah, I think the Brazilian Navy would've won that battle easy."
"I don't think you can get no injera at Taco Bell. I mean, I been to Taco Bell a bunch of times, and I never seen that on the menu. They got tacos, burritos, and nachos, but I don't think they got no Ethiopian food like injera.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think I know this one. Lord Voldemort, he's that bad guy from them Harry Potter books, right? I remember somethin' about him and Durmstrang. I think it's that one teacher, Karkaroff, he was in league with Voldemort or somethin'. So yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is (A) Yes."

So, at the end of the match, Dave is playin' cheerleader.

The answer is (C) cheerleader."
"So, let's see... they're all tradin' books around. 

First, Bob and Alice swap. Now Bob's got The Pearl. 

Then Claire and Dave swap. Claire's got Lolita, and Dave's got Moby Dick.

After that, Bob and Dave swap. Now Bob's striker, and Dave's right midfielder.

Finally, Dave and Eve swap. Now Dave's cheerleader, and Eve's right midfielder.

But wait, we're lookin' for Bob's position. Let's go back... Bob was a striker, but then he swapped with Dave, so now Bob's a striker, and Dave's right midfielder. But then Dave swapped with Eve, so Dave's cheerleader, and Eve's right midfielder. But that don't change Bob's position. He's still a striker.

So, the answer is (D) striker."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got these dancers, and they keep swappin' partners. Let's see...

First, Claire and Dave switch. Claire was with Lola, now she's with Sam. Dave was with Sam, now he's with Lola.

Then Eve and Bob switch. Don't matter to Dave, he's still with Lola.

Next, Claire and Alice switch. Claire was with Sam, now she's with Karl. Alice was with Karl, now she's with Sam.

Finally, Claire and Dave switch again. Claire was with Karl, now she's with Lola. Dave was with Lola, now he's with... Karl!

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Karl. That's (B)."

"So, we got these soccer players, and they keep swappin' positions. Let's see... 

First, Dave and Bob switch. Then Claire and Eve switch. Then Eve and Bob switch. Then Alice and Claire switch. And finally, Alice and Dave switch.

Now, let's think about Eve. She started as the left midfielder. Then she switched with Claire, so she's on the bench. Then she switched with Bob, so she's on the right wing. And that's where she stays.

So, at the end of the match, Eve is playin' right winger.

The correct answer is (D) right winger."
"So we got these people swappin' gifts. Let's see what happens.

First, Alice and Dave swap. Alice had white, now she got purple. Dave had purple, now he got white.

Then Claire and Dave swap. Claire had yellow, now she got white. Dave had white, now he got yellow.

So, at the end, Eve got the yellow present. That's the answer.

The correct answer is (D) yellow present."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, we got these dancers, and they're all switchin' partners. Let's see...

At first, Alice is with Melissa, Bob's with Sam, Claire's with Lola, Dave's with Patrick, and Eve's with Jamie.

Then, Bob and Dave switch. So now, Bob's with Patrick, and Dave's with Sam.

Next, Claire and Bob switch. Now, Claire's with Patrick, and Bob's with Lola.

After that, Eve and Dave switch. So, Eve's with Sam, and Dave's with Jamie.

Then, Claire and Alice switch. Now, Claire's with Melissa, and Alice is with Lola.

Finally, Dave and Alice switch. So, Dave's with Lola, and Alice is with Jamie.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Jamie.

The answer is (E) Jamie."
"So, we gotta figure out where Claire is playin' at the end of the soccer match. Let's go through the swaps:

First, Dave and Bob switch. Then Alice and Claire switch. Then Claire and Eve switch. Then Bob and Claire switch. Finally, Dave and Eve switch.

Let's start with where everyone was at first:
- Alice: Benchwarmer
- Bob: Right Midfielder
- Claire: Right Winger
- Dave: Center Midfielder
- Eve: Left Winger

Now, let's do the swaps:
- Dave and Bob switch: 
  - Alice: Benchwarmer
  - Bob: Center Midfielder
  - Claire: Right Winger
  - Dave: Right Midfielder
  - Eve: Left Winger
- Alice and Claire switch:

  - Eve: Benchwarmer
- Dave and Eve switch: 
  - Alice: Right Winger
  - Bob: Left Winger
  - Claire: Center Midfielder
  - Dave: Benchwarmer
  - Eve: Right Midfielder

So, at the end, Claire is playin' center midfielder. That's option (E)."
"So, we got these five friends, and they're all tradin' books. Let's see what happens.

At first, Alice has Lolita, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has Ulysses, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Odyssey.

Then, Bob and Alice swap books. Now Alice has The Great Gatsby, and Bob has Lolita.

Next, Eve and Claire swap books. Now Claire has The Odyssey, and Eve has Ulysses.

After that, Alice and Bob swap books again. Now Alice has Lolita, and Bob has The Great Gatsby.

Then, Dave and Eve swap books. Now Dave has Ulysses, and Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring.

Finally, Claire and Eve swap books. Now Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Odyssey.

So, at the end of the semester, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring. The correct answer is (C)."
"So, we got these five friends, and they're all tradin' books. Let's see what happens.

First, Claire and Dave swap books. So now Claire's got Catch-22, and Dave's got The Great Gatsby.

Then, Bob and Claire swap books. Now Bob's got Catch-22, and Claire's got Lolita.

Next, Dave and Alice swap books. Now Dave's got Moby Dick, and Alice's got The Great Gatsby.

After that, Dave and Claire swap books again. Now Dave's got Lolita, and Claire's got Moby Dick.

Finally, Claire and Eve swap books. Now Claire's got Ulysses, and Eve's got Moby Dick.

So, at the end of all this tradin', Bob's still got Catch-22. That's the answer.

The correct answer is (D) Catch-22."
"So we gotta figure out what gift Eve ends up with. Let's go through it step by step.

First, Eve and Alice swap gifts. So now Eve has the green present and Alice has the pink ball.

Then, Dave and Bob swap gifts. That don't affect Eve, so we don't care about that one right now.

Next, Claire and Dave swap gifts. Still don't affect Eve.

After that, Eve and Claire swap gifts. Now Eve has the white present and Claire has the green present.

Finally, Bob and Dave swap gifts. That don't affect Eve neither.

So, at the end, Eve has the white present. The answer is (D) white present."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got these dancers, and they keep swappin' partners. Let's see...

At first, we got these pairs: Alice and Jamie, Bob and Lola, Claire and Izzi, Dave and Rodrigo, and Eve and Ophelia.

Then, Bob and Eve switch. So now Bob's with Ophelia, and Eve's with Lola.

Next, Alice and Bob switch. Now Bob's with Jamie, and Alice is with Ophelia.

After that, Dave and Alice switch. So Dave's with Ophelia, and Alice is with Rodrigo.

Then, Dave and Claire switch. Now Dave's with Lola, and Claire's with Ophelia.

Finally, Bob and Claire switch. So Bob's with Ophelia, and Claire's with Jamie.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Ophelia.

The correct answer is (A) Ophelia."
"I'm just a regular fella, but I'll give it a shot. So, we got these dancers, and they're swappin' partners left and right. Let's see...

At first, we got:
- Claire and Lola
- Dave and Jamie
- Eve and Izzi
- Alice and Karl (I'm guessin' since she wasn't with anyone else)
- Bob and Ophelia (same reason)

Now, they start swappin' partners:
1. Claire and Alice switch: Now Claire's with Karl, and Alice is with Lola.
2. Eve and Alice switch: Now Eve's with Lola, and Alice is with Izzi.
3. Claire and Dave switch: Now Claire's with Jamie, and Dave's with Karl.
4. Dave and Bob switch: Now Dave's with Ophelia, and Bob's with Karl.
5. Claire and Alice switch (again): Now Claire's with Izzi, and Alice is with Jamie.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave's dancin' with Ophelia. That's my answer: (D) Ophelia."
"So we gotta figure out what present Alice ends up with. Let's go through it step by step.

First, Claire and Alice swap. Alice had a red one, now she's got a green one. Claire had a green one, now she's got a red one.

Then Dave and Eve swap. Dave had a pink ball, now he's got a white one. Eve had a white one, now she's got a pink ball.

So, Alice ends up with the pink ball. The answer is (C) pink ball."
"Let's see what happens with the balls. 

First, Bob and Alice swap. So now Bob has the black ball and Alice has the brown ball.

Then, Alice and Claire swap. Now Alice has the red ball and Claire has the brown ball.

Next, Eve and Alice swap. Now Alice has the green ball and Eve has the red ball.

After that, Claire and Bob swap. Now Bob has the brown ball and Claire has the black ball.

Finally, Claire and Dave swap. Now Claire has the white ball and Dave has the black ball.

So, at the end, Bob has the brown ball.

The correct answer is (A)."
"So, we got these people playin' soccer, and they're swappin' positions. Let's see...

First, Claire and Dave trade positions. Claire was right winger, and Dave was fullback, so now Claire's fullback and Dave's right winger.

Then, Dave and Bob trade positions. Dave was right winger, and Bob was benchwarmer, so now Dave's benchwarmer and Bob's right winger.

Next, Alice and Bob trade positions. Alice was cheerleader, and Bob was right winger, so now Alice is right winger and Bob's cheerleader.

After that, Eve and Dave trade positions. Eve was right midfielder, and Dave was benchwarmer, so now Eve's benchwarmer and Dave's right midfielder.

Finally, Alice and Dave trade positions. Alice was right winger, and Dave was right midfielder, so now Alice is right midfielder and Dave's right winger.

"Let's go through this gift swappin' thing step by step.

First, we gotta know who had what. Alice had a brown present, Bob had a yellow one, Claire had a purple one, Dave had a green one, Eve had a black ball, Fred had a pink ball, and Gertrude had a blue one.

Now, let's see what happened.

Eve and Fred swapped gifts, so Eve got the pink ball and Fred got the black ball.

Then, Dave and Bob swapped gifts. Now Dave has the yellow present and Bob has the green one.

Next, Claire and Gertrude swapped gifts. Claire got the blue present and Gertrude got the purple one.

After that, Fred and Claire swapped gifts. Fred got the blue present and Claire got the black ball.

Then, Bob and Fred swapped gifts. Bob got the blue present and Fred got the green one.

Next, Gertrude and Alice swapped gifts. Gertrude got the brown present and Alice got the purple one.

Finally, Bob and Claire swapped gifts. Bob got the black ball and Claire got the blue present.

But wait, we need to figure out what Alice got in the end. We know Gertrude and Alice swapped gifts, and Gertrude got the brown present. So, Alice must have gotten the purple present from Gertrude, but then Gertrude got the brown present from Alice. Then, Alice didn't swap with anyone else, but we know Alice had the brown present initially and then got the purple present.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. So, we got a bunch of people playin' soccer, and they keep swappin' positions. I'm gonna try to keep track of it.

First, Gertrude and Claire trade positions. Then, Alice and Eve trade positions. Then, Claire and Bob trade positions. Then, Eve and Dave trade positions. Then, Claire and Gertrude trade positions again. Then, Dave and Gertrude trade positions. Finally, Fred and Eve trade positions.

Now, let's think about Claire. She started as a fullback, but then she traded with Gertrude, who was a left midfielder. Then, Claire traded with Bob, who was a cheerleader, but that's not a position on the field, so we can ignore that. Then, Claire traded with Gertrude again, so she's back to bein' a left midfielder.

So, at the end of the match, Claire is playin' left midfielder.

The correct answer is (F) left midfielder."
"I'm gonna try to figger out who Eve is dancin' with. 

Alright, so at first, we got these pairs: 
- Alice and Sam
- Bob and Karl
- Claire and Izzi
- Dave and Jamie
- Eve and Helga
- Fred and Rodrigo
- Gertrude and Ophelia

Then they start swappin' partners. Claire and Eve switch, so now Eve's with Izzi and Claire's with Helga.

Next, Alice and Fred switch, so now Alice is with Rodrigo and Fred's with Sam.

Then Gertrude and Dave switch, so now Gertrude's with Jamie and Dave's with Ophelia.

After that, Eve and Bob switch, so now Eve's with Karl and Bob's with Izzi.

Then Eve and Fred switch, so now Eve's with Sam and Fred's with Karl.

Next, Bob and Claire switch, so now Bob's with Helga and Claire's with Izzi.

Finally, Fred and Gertrude switch, so now Fred's with Jamie and Gertrude's with Karl.

So, at the end, Eve is dancin' with Sam.

The answer is (F)."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got a bunch of people swappin' gifts. Let's see...

Alice starts with a red present, and Gertrude starts with a yellow one. They swap, so now Alice has yellow and Gertrude has red.

Then Dave swaps with Gertrude, so Dave gets the red one and Gertrude gets an orange ball.

Next, Fred and Claire swap, so Fred gets a brown present and Claire gets a pink ball.

After that, Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets a white present and Eve gets a red one.

Then Fred and Claire swap again, but that don't change nothin' for Eve.

Then Alice and Bob swap, so Alice gets a white present and Bob gets a yellow one.

Finally, Bob and Gertrude swap, but that don't change nothin' for Eve neither.

So, at the end, Eve has the red present. But I don't see that option, so I'm gonna pick the closest thing. I think Eve has the (C) red present, but that ain't an option. Wait, I see it's not there, but I think it's close to (C) red present, but I see (C) is the red present."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got a bunch of dancers, and they're all switchin' partners. Let's see...

We know Claire is on the bench, Dave is cheerin', Eve is strikin', Fred is on the right midfield, and Gertrude is on the right wing.

Then, Dave and Gertrude swap. Now Dave's on the right wing, and Gertrude's cheerin'.

Next, Dave and Fred swap. Now Dave's on the right midfield, and Fred's on the right wing.

After that, Alice and Dave swap. Now Alice is on the right midfield, and Dave's... well, we don't know what Dave's doin' yet.

Then, Alice and Gertrude swap. Now Alice is cheerin', and Gertrude's on the right midfield.

Next, Bob and Eve swap. Now Bob's strikin', and Eve's... we don't know what Eve's doin' yet.

Then, Dave and Alice swap again. Now Dave's cheerin', and Alice is... we still don't know what Alice is doin'.

Finally, Claire and Dave swap. Now Claire's cheerin', and Dave's on the bench.

Now, let's look at Dave. He's got The Pearl. But we made another mistake. I think I need to start again.

Okay, let me think... If Eve and Claire swap books, and then Fred and Claire swap books, that means Fred gets Lolita, and Claire gets The Pearl. Then, if Alice and Fred swap books, Alice gets The Pearl, and Fred gets Frankenstein. Then, if Claire and Dave swap books, Claire gets The Odyssey, and Dave gets The Pearl.

But then, Bob and Gertrude swap books, and Bob gets Moby Dick, and Gertrude gets The Fellowship of the Ring. And then, Eve and Bob swap books, and Eve gets Moby Dick, and Bob gets Lolita.

Now, let's look at Dave. He's got The Pearl. No, wait, that's not right. He's got... Moby Dick! No, that's not right either. He's got... The Odyssey! No, that's not it. He's got...

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of dancers, and they're all swappin' partners. Let's see...

At first, Alice is with Melissa, Bob is with Sam, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Rodrigo, Eve is with Karl, Fred is with Lola, and Gertrude is with Patrick.

Then, Dave and Bob switch partners, so now Dave is with Sam, and Bob is with Rodrigo.

Next, Claire and Bob switch partners, so now Claire is with Rodrigo, and Bob is with Izzi.

After that, Eve and Bob switch partners, so now Eve is with Izzi, and Bob is with Karl.

Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners, so now Gertrude is with Karl, and Bob is with Patrick.

Next, Claire and Dave switch partners, so now Claire is with Sam, and Dave is with Rodrigo.

Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners, so now Alice is with Karl, and Gertrude is with Melissa.

Finally, Bob and Fred switch partners, so now Bob is with Lola, and Fred is with Patrick.

So, at the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with... (C) Melissa."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of people dancin' and swappin' partners. Let's start with the first switch: Bob and Dave switch partners. That means Bob's now dancin' with Dave's partner, and Dave's dancin' with Bob's partner.

Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners. Gertrude's now dancin' with Fred's partner, and Fred's dancin' with Gertrude's partner.

Next, Fred and Bob switch partners. Fred's now dancin' with Bob's partner, and Bob's dancin' with Fred's partner.

After that, Eve and Bob switch partners. Eve's now dancin' with Bob's partner, and Bob's dancin' with Eve's partner.

Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners. Gertrude's now dancin' with Alice's partner, and Alice's dancin' with Gertrude's partner.

Next, Fred and Claire switch partners. Fred's now dancin' with Claire's partner, and Claire's dancin' with Fred's partner.

Finally, Claire and Eve switch partners. Claire's now dancin' with Eve's partner, and Eve's dancin' with Claire's partner.

Now, let's try to figger out who Gertrude's dancin' with. We know Gertrude started out dancin' with Helga. Then, she switched with Fred, so she was dancin' with Fred's partner, which was Melissa. Then, she switched with Alice, so she was dancin' with Alice's partner, which was Jamie.

So, Gertrude's dancin' with Jamie.

The answer is (B) Jamie."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of dancers, and they keep swappin' partners. I'm gonna keep track of who's dancin' with who.

At first, it's like this:
- Alice is dancin' with Melissa.
- Bob is dancin' with Ophelia.
- Claire is dancin' with Patrick.
- Dave is dancin' with Jamie.
- Eve is dancin' with Lola.
- Fred is dancin' with Helga.
- Gertrude is dancin' with Izzi.

Then, they start swappin' partners. I'm gonna write down each swap:
1. Alice and Fred swap: Alice is now dancin' with Helga, and Fred is dancin' with Melissa.
2. Gertrude and Eve swap: Gertrude is now dancin' with Lola, and Eve is dancin' with Izzi.
3. Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude is now dancin' with Helga, and Alice is dancin' with Lola.
4. Bob and Alice swap: Bob is now dancin' with Lola, and Alice is dancin' with Ophelia.
5. Dave and Fred swap: Dave is now dancin' with Melissa, and Fred is dancin' with Jamie.
6. Eve and Alice swap: Eve is now dancin' with Ophelia, and Alice is dancin' with Izzi.
7. Eve and Claire swap: Eve is now dancin' with Patrick, and Claire is dancin' with Izzi.

Now, I'm gonna look at the last swap: Eve and Claire swapped, so Eve is dancin' with Patrick. But then I looked back, and I saw that Eve and Alice swapped before that, so Eve was dancin' with Ophelia. Then Eve and Claire swapped, so Eve is dancin' with Patrick. But then I looked back again, and I saw that Gertrude and Eve swapped, so Eve was dancin' with Izzi. Then Gertrude and Alice swapped, so Eve is still dancin' with Izzi. Then Bob and Alice swapped, so Eve is still dancin' with Izzi. Then Dave and Fred swapped, so Eve is still dancin' with Izzi. Then Eve and Alice swapped, so Eve is dancin' with Ophelia. Then Eve and Claire swapped, so Eve is dancin' with Patrick.

But then I looked back again, and I saw that Eve and Claire swapped, so Eve is dancin' with Izzi. No, wait, that's not right. Eve and Claire swapped, so Eve is dancin' with Patrick. No, that's not right either. Let me start again.

Eve is dancin' with Lola. Then Gertrude and Eve swap, so Eve is dancin' with Izzi. Then Gertrude and Alice swap, so Eve is still dancin' with Izzi. Then Bob and Alice swap, so Eve is still dancin' with Izzi. Then Dave and Fred swap, so Eve is still dancin' with Izzi. Then Eve and Alice swap, so Eve is dancin' with Ophelia. Then Eve and Claire swap, so Eve is dancin' with Patrick.

No, that's not right. Let me think about this some more. I'm gonna start again from the beginning.

After all the swappin', I think Eve is dancin' with... (B) Izzi."

Now, let's see what Dave has. He swapped with Bob in step 2, so he got the yellow present. But then, he didn't swap with anyone else. Wait, that's not right. He didn't swap with anyone else that would change what he has.

So, Dave has the yellow present. But that's not an option. Let me go back and check. Ah, I see the problem. I made a mistake. Dave swapped with Gertrude in step 6, but that's not right. Gertrude swapped with Alice.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of friends tradin' books, and we gotta keep track of who's got what. 

Let's start with the first trade: Alice and Gertrude swap books. So, Alice gets Lolita, and Gertrude gets Ulysses.

Then, Dave and Fred swap books. Now, Dave's got The Pearl, and Fred's got Moby Dick.

Next, Alice and Claire swap books. Alice gets Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire gets Lolita.

After that, Claire and Bob swap books. Claire gets The Odyssey, and Bob gets Lolita.

Then, Eve and Claire swap books. Eve gets The Odyssey, and Claire gets Frankenstein.

Next, Fred and Alice swap books. Fred gets Hound of the Baskervilles, and Alice gets Moby Dick.

Finally, Claire and Dave swap books. Claire gets The Pearl, and Dave gets Frankenstein.

So, at the end of the semester, Fred's got Hound of the Baskervilles.

The answer is (B) Hound of the Baskervilles."
"Let's think this through. We got a bunch of people playin' soccer, and they're swappin' positions. We need to figure out where Gertrude ends up.

First, Alice and Fred trade positions. Then, Claire and Gertrude trade positions. So now Gertrude's playin' left winger. But we ain't done yet.

Next, Dave and Alice trade positions. Then, Bob and Dave trade positions. Then, Bob and Eve trade positions. Then, Eve and Alice trade positions. Finally, Gertrude and Dave trade positions.

So, if Gertrude was playin' left winger and she traded with Dave, that means Dave's playin' left winger now, and Gertrude's playin'... benchwarmer.

The final answer is: (F)"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of friends tradin' books. Let's go through it step by step.

1. Fred and Alice swap books: 
   - Fred had The Odyssey, Alice had Catch-22. Now, Fred has Catch-22, and Alice has The Odyssey.

2. Fred and Eve swap books: 
   - Fred had Catch-22, Eve had Frankenstein. Now, Fred has Frankenstein, and Eve has Catch-22.

3. Fred and Dave swap books: 
   - Fred had Frankenstein, Dave had The Great Gatsby. Now, Fred has The Great Gatsby, and Dave has Frankenstein.

4. Claire and Fred swap books: 
   - Claire had Lolita, Fred had The Great Gatsby. Now, Claire has The Great Gatsby, and Fred has Lolita.

5. Gertrude and Dave swap books: 
   - Gertrude had Moby Dick, Dave had Frankenstein. Now, Gertrude has Frankenstein, and Dave has Moby Dick.

6. Fred and Alice swap books: 
   - Fred had Lolita, Alice had The Odyssey. Now, Fred has The Odyssey, and Alice has Lolita.

7. Fred and Bob swap books: 
   - Fred had The Odyssey, Bob had The Fellowship of the Ring. Now, Fred has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Bob has The Odyssey.

Now, let's see what Claire has. She had Lolita, then she swapped it with Fred for The Great Gatsby. Then, she didn't swap with nobody else. So, Claire has The Great Gatsby.

The answer is (B) The Great Gatsby."
"Let's go through the swaps step by step:

1. Dave and Eve trade positions: 
   - Dave was fullback, Eve was left winger. Now Dave is left winger, Eve is fullback.

2. Eve and Alice trade positions: 
   - Eve was fullback, Alice was right midfielder. Now Eve is right midfielder, Alice is fullback.

3. Claire and Gertrude trade positions: 
   - Claire was center midfielder, Gertrude was striker. Now Claire is striker, Gertrude is center midfielder.

4. Fred and Dave trade positions: 
   - Fred was cheerleader, Dave was left winger. Now Fred is left winger, Dave is cheerleader.

5. Bob and Dave trade positions: 
   - Bob was right winger, Dave was cheerleader. Now Bob is cheerleader, Dave is right winger.

6. Claire and Dave trade positions: 
   - Claire was striker, Dave was right winger. Now Claire is right winger, Dave is striker.

7. Gertrude and Claire trade positions: 
   - Gertrude was center midfielder, Claire was right winger. Now Gertrude is right winger, Claire is center midfielder.

So, at the end of the match, Eve is playing right midfielder.

The correct answer is (A) right midfielder."
"Let's go through this soccer thing. We got a bunch of people playin' different spots. 

First, Alice is on the right, Bob's in the middle, Claire's in the back, Dave's on the left, Eve's on the left too, Fred's the goalie, and Gertrude's on the right.

Then they start swappin' spots. Alice and Dave switch, so now Alice is on the left and Dave's on the right.

Next, Claire and Bob switch, so Claire's in the middle and Bob's in the back.

Then Fred and Dave switch, so Fred's on the right and Dave's the goalie.

After that, Eve and Bob switch, so Eve's in the back and Bob's on the left.

Then Dave and Gertrude switch, so Dave's on the right and Gertrude's the goalie.

Next, Alice and Dave switch again, so Alice is on the right and Dave's on the left.

Finally, Claire and Eve switch, so Claire's in the back and Eve's in the middle.

So, at the end, Eve is playin' center midfielder. That's (B)."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of people tradin' balls. Let's see...

First, Eve and Gertrude swap. Eve gets the black ball, and Gertrude gets the blue ball.

Then, Fred and Bob swap. Fred gets the orange ball, and Bob gets the yellow ball.

Next, Fred and Claire swap. Fred gets the white ball, and Claire gets the orange ball.

After that, Eve and Fred swap. Eve gets the white ball, and Fred gets the black ball.

Then, Fred and Claire swap again. Fred gets the orange ball, and Claire gets the white ball.

Next, Alice and Bob swap. Alice gets the yellow ball, and Bob gets the green ball.

Finally, Dave and Gertrude swap. Dave gets the blue ball, and Gertrude gets the pink ball.

So, at the end, Eve has the white ball. That's option (E)."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of friends tradin' books, and we wanna know what book Dave ends up with.

Let's go through the trades:

1. Fred and Alice swap books: Fred gets Catch-22, Alice gets The Odyssey.
2. Fred and Eve swap books: Fred gets Frankenstein, Eve gets The Odyssey.
3. Fred and Dave swap books: Fred gets The Great Gatsby, Dave gets Frankenstein.
4. Claire and Fred swap books: Fred gets Lolita, Claire gets The Great Gatsby.
5. Gertrude and Dave swap books: Gertrude gets Frankenstein, Dave gets Moby Dick.
6. Fred and Alice swap books: Fred gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Lolita.
7. Fred and Bob swap books: Fred gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob gets The Odyssey.

Now, let's look at the last few trades:

- Dave had Moby Dick, then swapped with Gertrude and got The Great Gatsby.
- Then, Dave swapped with Alice and got Lolita.
- Then, Dave swapped with Eve and got The Odyssey.
- Then, Dave swapped with Fred and got Moby Dick.
- Then, Dave swapped with Claire and got The Fellowship of the Ring.

Gertrude and Eve switch first. Then Eve and Alice switch. Then Fred and Dave switch. Then Bob and Claire switch. Then Fred and Alice switch again. Then Claire and Eve switch. And finally, Eve and Bob switch.

I'm gonna try to keep track of who's dancin' with who. Claire starts with Helga. Then she switches with Bob, so she's dancin' with... um... whoever Bob was dancin' with. That's Ophelia. No, wait, that's not right. Bob was dancin' with Ophelia, but then he switched with Claire, so Claire's dancin' with... uh... whoever Bob was dancin' with before he switched with Claire. That's not Ophelia, 'cause Bob was already dancin' with Ophelia. I'm gettin' all confused.

Let me start over. Claire starts with Helga. Then she switches with Bob, so she's dancin' with... whoever Bob was dancin' with. That's not Helga, 'cause Claire already had Helga. And it's not Ophelia, 'cause Bob was already dancin' with Ophelia. I think I need to look at the other options.

I know! Let me try to figger out who Bob was dancin' with before he switched with Claire. If I can do that, I can figger out who Claire's dancin' with. Bob switches with Eve at the end, so before that, he must've been dancin' with... whoever Eve wasn't dancin' with. Eve was dancin' with Lola, so Bob must've been dancin' with... uh... not Lola. And not Ophelia, 'cause Bob was already dancin' with Ophelia. I'm gettin' all confused again.

Wait a minute... I think I got it! Bob switches with Claire, and then he switches with Eve. So before he switched with Eve, he must've been dancin' with... whoever Eve wasn't dancin' with. And before he switched with Claire, he must've been dancin' with... whoever Claire wasn't dancin' with. Claire was dancin' with Helga, so Bob must've been dancin' with... not Helga. And not Ophelia, 'cause Bob was already dancin' with Ophelia. But I think I can figger it out.

If Bob was dancin' with Ophelia, and then he switched with Claire, and then he switched with Eve, that means... uh... Claire must've been dancin' with... whoever Bob was dancin' with before he switched with Claire. And that's... uh... not Ophelia. But I think I can figger it out.

I'm gonna take a guess. I think Claire's dancin' with... Jamie. Yeah, that's right! The answer is (D)."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got a bunch of people playin' soccer, and they keep swappin' positions. 

First, Alice and Dave switch. Then Alice and Claire switch. Then Alice and Dave switch again. Then Claire and Fred switch. Then Dave and Eve switch. Then Gertrude and Bob switch. And finally, Gertrude and Dave switch.

Let's see... If we start with Gertrude, she's a fullback. Then she switches with Bob, so she's playin' whatever Bob was playin', which is striker. Then she switches with Dave, so now she's playin' whatever Dave was playin'. 

Now, let's go back to Dave. He started as center midfielder, then switched with Alice, then switched with Alice again, then switched with Claire, and then switched with Eve. So Dave was playin' cheerleader. 

So Gertrude switched with Dave, and Dave was playin' cheerleader. That means Gertrude is playin' cheerleader.

The correct answer is (B) cheerleader."
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got a bunch of people playin' soccer, and they keep swappin' positions. Let's see...

At first, we got:
- Right midfielder: Bob
- Cheerleader: Claire
- Striker: Dave
- Center midfielder: Eve
- Benchwarmer: Fred
- Left midfielder: Gertrude

Then they start swappin' positions:
1. Eve and Claire trade. Now Eve's cheerin' and Claire's in the middle.
- Right midfielder: Bob
- Cheerleader: Eve
- Striker: Dave
- Center midfielder: Claire
- Benchwarmer: Fred
- Left midfielder: Gertrude

2. Gertrude and Dave trade. Now Gertrude's strikin' and Dave's on the left.
- Right midfielder: Bob
- Cheerleader: Eve
- Striker: Gertrude
- Center midfielder: Claire
- Benchwarmer: Fred
- Left midfielder: Dave

3. Bob and Claire trade. Now Bob's in the middle and Claire's on the right.
- Right midfielder: Claire
- Cheerleader: Eve
- Striker: Gertrude
- Center midfielder: Bob
- Benchwarmer: Fred
- Left midfielder: Dave

4. Fred and Dave trade. Now Fred's on the left and Dave's on the bench.
- Right midfielder: Claire
- Cheerleader: Eve
- Striker: Gertrude
- Center midfielder: Bob
- Benchwarmer: Dave
- Left midfielder: Fred

5. Gertrude and Fred trade. Now Gertrude's on the left and Fred's strikin'.
- Right midfielder: Claire
- Cheerleader: Eve
- Striker: Fred
- Center midfielder: Bob
- Benchwarmer: Dave

6. Fred and Claire trade. Now Fred's on the right and Claire's strikin'.
- Right midfielder: Fred
- Cheerleader: Eve
- Striker: Claire
- Center midfielder: Bob
- Benchwarmer: Dave
- Left midfielder: Gertrude

I think that's it. So, at the end of the match, Fred is playin' right midfielder. The answer is (E) right midfielder."
"I'm gonna try to figger out what book Fred's got at the end of the semester. 

So, they all start with these books: Alice gets Ulysses, Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire gets The Odyssey, Dave gets Lolita, Eve gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Fred gets Frankenstein, and Gertrude gets The Great Gatsby.

Then they start swappin' books. First, Fred and Dave swap, so Fred gets Lolita and Dave gets Frankenstein. Then Alice and Claire swap, but that don't affect Fred. Then Eve and Dave swap, and Eve gets Frankenstein. Then Bob and Eve swap, but I don't know what Bob gets 'cause it don't say what book Bob had before. Then Gertrude and Claire swap, and that don't affect Fred neither. Then Eve and Gertrude swap, but I don't know what they get. Then Dave and Bob swap, and Dave gets Frankenstein again.

So, at the end, Fred's still got the book he got from Dave, which is Lolita. 

The answer is (F) Lolita."

Then Fred and Claire switch, so now Fred's up front and Claire's on the right in the middle.

Next, Dave and Gertrude switch, so now Dave's the goalie and Gertrude's on the left in the middle.

After that, Alice and Eve switch, so now Alice is in the middle and Eve's cheerin'.

Then Fred and Bob switch, so now Fred's on the left and Bob's up front.

Next, Claire and Gertrude switch, so now Claire's on the left in the middle and Gertrude's on the right in the middle.

Then Fred and Dave switch, so now Fred's the goalie and Dave's on the left.

Finally, Eve and Claire switch, so now Eve's on the left in the middle and Claire's cheerin'.

So, at the end of the game, Claire's playin' cheerleader.

The answer is (A) cheerleader."
"I'm gonna try to figger out who got which book. So, they all started with a book, and then they swapped 'em around. 

First, Bob and Alice swapped. So, Alice got Bob's book, which was Hound of the Baskervilles. Then, Bob swapped with Dave, so Bob got Dave's book, which was The Great Gatsby. 

Then, Fred and Dave swapped, so Fred got Dave's old book, which was The Pearl. But then Fred swapped with Claire, so Fred got The Odyssey, and Claire got The Pearl.

Next, Dave and Eve swapped, so Dave got Frankenstein, and Eve got The Fellowship of the Ring. Then, Bob and Eve swapped, so Bob got The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve got The Great Gatsby.

Finally, Gertrude and Eve swapped, so Gertrude got The Great Gatsby, and Eve got Ulysses.

So, let's see who got which book... Alice got Hound of the Baskervilles. That's the one.

The answer is (G) Hound of the Baskervilles."
"I'm gonna try to figger out who Dave is dancin' with. 

Alright, so at first, everyone's got a partner. Then they start swappin' partners. Eve and Dave switch, so now Dave's dancin' with Rodrigo. Then Fred and Eve switch, so now Dave's still dancin' with Rodrigo. 

Next, Alice and Gertrude switch, but that don't affect Dave. Then Dave and Bob switch, so now Dave's dancin' with... well, I don't know who Bob was dancin' with, but it ain't Rodrigo no more. 

Then Alice and Claire switch, and that don't affect Dave neither. Then Alice and Gertrude switch again, but that's just like before, so it don't change nothin' for Dave. Finally, Bob and Claire switch, but that don't tell me who Dave's dancin' with neither.

Now, I'm thinkin', who's left for Dave? I know it ain't Rodrigo, 'cause Claire's dancin' with him now. And it ain't Patrick, 'cause Fred's dancin' with him. And it ain't Melissa, 'cause Eve's dancin' with her. And it ain't Karl, 'cause Bob's dancin' with him. And it ain't Lola, 'cause Alice is dancin' with her. So, that leaves... Jamie.

The correct answer is (A) Jamie."

Then Eve and Gertrude swap. Eve had a ball, now she's got the purple present. Gertrude had the purple present, now she's got a ball.

Finally, Dave and Bob swap. Dave had a ball, now he's got the black ball. Bob had the black ball, now he's got a ball.

Now, let's see what Gertrude's got. She had a pink ball, then she got the purple present, then she swapped it for a ball. I think that ball's the orange one. I don't know how I figgered it out, but that's what I think.

The correct answer is (F) orange ball."

Then Bob and Dave swap. Bob had an orange ball, now he's got a pink ball. Dave had a pink ball, now he's got an orange ball.

Next, Dave and Alice swap. But wait, Alice had a white thing, not an orange ball. So Dave's still got an orange ball, and Alice is still got a white thing.

First, Bob and Fred switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Then, Fred and Bob switch partners again. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners.

Let's start with Fred. He starts with Helga. Then, he switches with Bob, so he's with Melissa. Then, he switches with Bob again, so he's back with Helga. Then, he switches with Claire, so he's with Lola. That's it for Fred.

Now, let's look at the options. We got Helga, Ophelia, Lola, Melissa, Rodrigo, Izzi, and Karl. We know Fred's not with Helga 'cause he switched with Claire. We know he's not with Melissa 'cause he switched with Bob and then switched back. We know he's not with Rodrigo, Izzi, or Karl 'cause they're not even in the mix. We know he's not with Ophelia 'cause she's not mentioned after the first switch.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of friends tradin' books, and we wanna know what book Dave ends up with.

Let's go through the trades:

1. Bob and Gertrude swap books. 
   Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring, and Gertrude gets Catch-22.

2. Eve and Dave swap books. 
   Eve gets Moby Dick, and Dave gets Lolita.

3. Alice and Gertrude swap books. 
   Alice gets Catch-22, and Gertrude gets The Great Gatsby.

4. Eve and Alice swap books. 
   Eve gets The Great Gatsby, and Alice gets Moby Dick.

5. Fred and Eve swap books. 
   Fred gets The Great Gatsby, and Eve gets The Pearl.

6. Alice and Bob swap books. 
   Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring, and Bob gets Moby Dick.

7. Claire and Alice swap books. 
   Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring, and Alice gets Ulysses.

Now, let's look at Dave. He swapped with Eve and got Lolita. Then, nobody else swapped with Dave. So, Dave still has Lolita.

The answer is (F) Lolita."
"Let's go through this step by step. 

First, we gotta figure out who's got what ball at the start. Alice has blue, Bob has red, Claire has brown, Dave has purple, Eve has black, Fred has pink, and Gertrude has green.

Now, let's do the swaps. Fred and Alice swap, so now Alice has pink and Fred has blue. Then Claire and Gertrude swap, so Claire has green and Gertrude has brown. Then Bob and Dave swap, so Bob has purple and Dave has red. Then Eve and Alice swap, so Eve has pink and Alice has black. Then Claire and Bob swap, so Claire has purple and Bob has green. Then Dave and Eve swap, so Dave has black and Eve has red. Then Claire and Bob swap again, so Claire has green and Bob has purple.

So, at the end, Claire has the green ball.

The answer is (F)."
"Let's go through this step by step. 

Gertrude and Alice swap balls first. So now Gertrude has the purple ball and Alice has the blue ball.

Then Fred and Bob swap. Now Fred has the pink ball and Bob has the green ball.

Next, Fred and Claire swap. Now Fred has the orange ball and Claire has the pink ball.

After that, Eve and Dave swap. Now Eve has the black ball and Dave has the brown ball.

Then Alice and Eve swap. Now Alice has the black ball and Eve has the blue ball.

Next, Alice and Claire swap. Now Alice has the pink ball and Claire has the black ball.

Finally, Claire and Fred swap. Now Claire has the orange ball and Fred has the black ball.

So, at the end of the game, Claire has the orange ball.

The answer is (C)."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of dancers, and they're all swappin' partners. I'm gonna follow along and see who ends up with who.

Okay, so first, Fred and Bob switch. Then Eve and Alice switch. Then Fred and Eve switch again. Then Claire and Fred switch. Then Gertrude and Alice switch. Then Alice and Bob switch. And finally, Dave and Fred switch.

Let's see... after all them switches, I think Alice ends up with... (C) Patrick."
"Let's break down them gift swaps. 

Gertrude and Eve swap gifts, so Gertrude gets the brown present and Eve gets the yellow present. 

Then, Gertrude and Bob swap gifts, so Gertrude gets the blue present and Bob gets the brown present. 

Next, Gertrude and Fred swap gifts, so Gertrude gets the white present and Fred gets the blue present. 

After that, Bob and Dave swap gifts, so Bob gets the purple present and Dave gets the brown present. 

Then, Alice and Bob swap gifts, so Alice gets the purple present and Bob gets the green present. 

Next, Dave and Claire swap gifts, so Dave gets the red present and Claire gets the brown present. 

Finally, Claire and Alice swap gifts, so Claire gets the purple present and Alice gets the red present.

So, at the end, Bob has the green present.

The final answer is: (F)"
"I'm gonna try to figger out who got which book. 

So, Alice and Bob swapped books first. That means Alice got Frankenstein and Bob got Catch-22.

Then Gertrude and Claire swapped books. Now Gertrude got Ulysses and Claire got The Odyssey.

Next, Dave and Gertrude swapped books. Now Gertrude got Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave got Ulysses.

After that, Alice and Fred swapped books. Now Alice got The Fellowship of the Ring and Fred got Frankenstein.

Then Dave and Eve swapped books. Now Dave got Moby Dick and Eve got Ulysses.

Next, Claire and Bob swapped books. Now Claire got Catch-22 and Bob got The Odyssey.

Finally, Eve and Bob swapped books. Now Eve got The Odyssey and Bob got Ulysses.

But wait, I made a mistake. I forgot to keep track of Gertrude's book after she swapped with Dave. So, let me go back. Gertrude had Hound of the Baskervilles, but then she didn't swap it with anyone else. Then I made another mistake, I said Gertrude got The Fellowship of the Ring, but that's not right. 

Let me start again from the beginning.

Alice and Bob swapped books. Alice got Frankenstein and Bob got Catch-22.

Gertrude and Claire swapped books. Gertrude got Ulysses and Claire got The Odyssey.

Dave and Gertrude swapped books. Gertrude got Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave got Ulysses.

Alice and Fred swapped books. Alice got The Fellowship of the Ring and Fred got Frankenstein.

Dave and Eve swapped books. Dave got Moby Dick and Eve got Ulysses.

Claire and Bob swapped books. Claire got Catch-22 and Bob got The Odyssey.

Eve and Bob swapped books. Eve got The Odyssey and Bob got Ulysses.

Now, I think I got it right. Gertrude got Hound of the Baskervilles.

The answer is (A) Hound of the Baskervilles."
"I'm gonna try to figger out where Fred's playin' at the end of the match. 

Alright, so we got a bunch of swaps happenin'. First, Alice and Dave trade spots. Then Alice and Claire trade. Then Alice and Dave trade again. Then Claire and Fred trade. Then Dave and Eve trade. Then Gertrude and Bob trade. And finally, Gertrude and Dave trade.

Let's see... Fred traded with Claire, and that's the only time Fred's name comes up. So we gotta figger out where Claire was playin' before she traded with Fred. 

We know Fred was playin' left winger, 'cause that's what it says. And we know Claire traded with Fred, so Claire's playin' left winger now. But we don't know what Claire was playin' before that.

Now, let's look at the other swaps. We got Eve tradin' with Dave, and then Gertrude tradin' with Bob, and then Gertrude tradin' with Dave. That's a lot of tradin' goin' on. But we don't know what Dave or Bob or Gertrude was playin' before all them trades.

We do know that Eve's playin' fullback now, and Gertrude's playin' cheerleader. But that don't help us figger out where Fred's playin'.

I'm gonna take a guess. Since Fred was playin' left winger, and Claire traded with Fred, maybe Claire was playin' center midfielder. That's the only spot that ain't been mentioned yet.

So, I'm gonna say Fred's playin' (B) center midfielder."
"Let's go through the trades step by step:

First, Eve and Bob swap books. Eve had The Great Gatsby, and Bob had Ulysses. Now Eve has Ulysses, and Bob has The Great Gatsby.

Then, Dave and Gertrude swap books. Dave had Catch-22, and Gertrude had Lolita. Now Dave has Lolita, and Gertrude has Catch-22.

Next, Bob and Dave swap books. Bob had The Great Gatsby, and Dave had Lolita. Now Bob has Lolita, and Dave has The Great Gatsby.

After that, Bob and Claire swap books. Bob had Lolita, and Claire had Hound of the Baskervilles. Now Bob has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire has Lolita.

Then, Fred and Claire swap books. Fred had Frankenstein, and Claire had Lolita. Now Fred has Lolita, and Claire has Frankenstein.

Next, Alice and Claire swap books. Alice had The Fellowship of the Ring, and Claire had Frankenstein. Now Alice has Frankenstein, and Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring.

Finally, Claire and Dave swap books. Claire had The Fellowship of the Ring, and Dave had The Great Gatsby. Now Claire has The Great Gatsby, and Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.

Gertrude still has Catch-22.

The correct answer is (F) Catch-22."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got a bunch of people tradin' books. Let's see...

At first, Alice gets Frankenstein, Bob gets Ulysses, Claire gets The Great Gatsby, Dave gets The Odyssey, Eve gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred gets Catch-22, and Gertrude gets Moby Dick.

Then, they start swappin' books. Claire and Gertrude swap, so now Claire's got Moby Dick and Gertrude's got The Great Gatsby.

Next, Fred and Dave swap, so now Fred's got The Odyssey and Dave's got Catch-22.

Then, Bob and Alice swap, so now Bob's got Frankenstein and Alice got Ulysses.

Then, Fred and Eve swap, so now Fred's got The Great Gatsby and Eve's got The Odyssey.

Finally, Bob and Fred swap, so now Bob's got The Great Gatsby and Fred's got Catch-22.

But wait, we're tryin' to figure out what Gertrude's got. Let's go back... Gertrude had Moby Dick, then she got The Great Gatsby, then she got The Fellowship of the Ring, and then... she got The Odyssey.

So, Gertrude's got The Odyssey.

The correct answer is (A) The Odyssey."
"Let's try to figure out what gift Fred ends up with. 

First, Alice and Fred swap gifts, so Alice gets the brown present and Fred gets the blue present.

Then, Claire and Bob swap gifts, but that doesn't affect Fred.

Next, Dave and Fred swap gifts, so Fred gets the black ball and Dave gets the blue present.

After that, Eve and Alice swap gifts, but that doesn't affect Fred.

Then, Bob and Alice swap gifts, but that doesn't affect Fred either.

Next, Eve and Gertrude swap gifts, but that doesn't affect Fred.

Finally, Fred and Alice swap gifts, so Fred gets the brown present and Alice gets the black ball.

Wait, that's not right. Let's go back to the beginning. 

First, Alice and Fred swap gifts, so Alice gets the brown present and Fred gets the blue present.

Then, Claire and Bob swap gifts, but that doesn't affect Fred.

Next, Dave and Fred swap gifts, so Fred gets the black ball and Dave gets the blue present.

Next, Eve and Gertrude swap gifts, so Eve gets the orange ball and Gertrude gets the white present.

Finally, Fred and Alice swap gifts, so Fred gets the yellow present and Alice gets the black ball.

So, Fred ends up with the yellow present.

The correct answer is (B) yellow present."

So, the answer is:
(F) blue ball"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got a bunch of people playin' soccer, and they keep swappin' positions. Let's see...

At first, we got:
- Alice: right midfielder

"I'm gonna try to figger out who got which book. So, they all started with a book, and then they started swappin' 'em around.

Gertrude had Frankenstein, but then she swapped with Fred, so she got The Pearl. Then she swapped with Dave, so she got The Odyssey. 

Then Dave swapped with Claire, but that don't matter to Gertrude. Then Alice and Bob swapped, but that don't matter neither. Then Eve and Claire swapped, but that don't matter to Gertrude neither.

The correct answer is (B)."
"I'm gonna try to figger out where Claire's playin' at the end of the game. So, we gotta keep track of all the swaps.

At first, everyone's in these positions:
- Alice: Striker
- Bob: Cheerleader
- Claire: Fullback
- Dave: Benchwarmer
- Eve: Left Winger
- Fred: Center Midfielder
- Gertrude: Right Winger

Then, Eve and Alice trade spots:
- Alice: Left Winger
- Bob: Cheerleader
- Claire: Fullback
- Dave: Benchwarmer
- Eve: Striker
- Fred: Center Midfielder
- Gertrude: Right Winger

Next, Alice and Bob trade spots:

Then, Fred and Alice trade spots:

I think that's it. I'm not really sure what happened at the end 'cause it got kinda confusing. But based on what I got, Claire's playin' Left Winger.

The final answer is (D)."
"I'm gonna try to figger out who Dave's dancin' with at the end. 

So, at first, Dave's dancin' with Patrick. Then, Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave's dancin' with Helga now.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got a bunch of dancers, and they're all switchin' partners. I'm only worried 'bout Gertrude, 'cause that's who the question's askin' about.

Okay, so Gertrude starts with Karl. Then, some other people switch, but it don't matter 'cause it ain't Gertrude. Then, Gertrude switches with Fred, so now she's with Helga. Then, some more people switch, but it still ain't Gertrude. Then, Gertrude switches with Dave, so now she's with... well, I gotta figger out who Dave was with. 

Let's see... Dave was with Ophelia, then he switched with Bob, so Dave was with Claire. Then, Gertrude switched with Dave, so Gertrude's with... Claire! But that ain't one of the choices. Wait, I made a mistake. I gotta go back and look again.

Okay, so Gertrude switches with Fred, and then Fred switches with Alice, and then Bob and Eve switch, and then Gertrude switches with Dave. And Dave was with... Ophelia! No, that's not right. Dave was with Claire, and then he switched with Gertrude, so Gertrude's with... Ophelia! No, that's not it either. 

Let me start again. Gertrude switches with Fred, so she's with Helga. Then, some other people switch, but it don't matter. Then, Gertrude switches with Dave, and Dave was with... Ophelia! No, that's not right. Dave was with Claire, but then he switched with Bob, and then Bob switched with Eve, so Dave was with... Ophelia! No, that's not it. 

I'm all confused now. Let me think... Gertrude switches with Fred, so she's with Helga. Then, some other people switch, but it don't matter. Then, Gertrude switches with Dave, and Dave was with... Claire! No, that's not one of the choices. 

I'm gonna take a guess. I think Gertrude's with... Ophelia! No, that's not it. I think Gertrude's with... Claire! No, that's not one of the choices. I think Gertrude's with... (C) Ophelia."

Finally, Fred and Bob swap balls. Fred had red, now he's got pink. Bob had pink, now he's got red.

Now, let's see... Claire's got the black ball. But the question's askin' what ball is to the left of Claire. I don't know the order of the people, so I'm just gonna look at the options. I see that the only ball that's not mentioned as bein' held by someone is the red ball, but that's held by Bob now. I don't know if Bob's to the left of Claire, but I'm gonna take a guess.

The correct answer is (G) black ball."
