"To determine how much Janet makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs used for breakfast and baking muffins from the total number of eggs laid.
3. Multiply the remaining number of eggs by the price per egg to find the daily earnings.

Let's go through the calculations:

1. Total number of eggs laid per day: \(16\)
2. Number of eggs used for breakfast and baking muffins: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
3. Remaining eggs to sell: \(16 - 7 = 9\)
4. Price per egg: \(2\) dollars

Therefore, the daily earnings from selling the eggs are:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"

3. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week (3 sessions): \(180 \times 3 = 540\) meters.

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to account for the pricing pattern where every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

This pattern repeats, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine the number of pairs by dividing 16 by 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

The total cost for 16 glasses is then \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, we need to calculate the total distance he covers and compare it to his initial distance from home.

1. **Initial Distance:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = \(60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = \(30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - He drives the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = \(80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered = \(0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = \(180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular and overtime pay separately and then sum them up.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = \( 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \).

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are \( 45 - 40 = 5 \) hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = \( 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12 \) per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = \( 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \).

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = \$400 + \$60 = \$460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we start by calculating the downloads for each month.

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 \times 0.70 = 126
   \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equation to find their current ages.

Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is given by:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week.

Each dog requires 0.5 hours per day. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

1. **Determine the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels is:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, Aaron has:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]

2. **Determine the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Therefore, Siobhan has:
     \[
     25 - 2 = 23
     \]

Thus, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

To find the points scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game, the total points scored is:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets.
2. Determine the total cost of the video games he buys.
3. Use the remaining money to find out how many lego sets he still has.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. Therefore, the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left should equal the total money he had from selling the lego sets:
\[ \$195 - \$160 - \$5 = \$30 \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{\$30}{\$15 \text{ per lego set}} = 2 \text{ lego sets} \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let his speed be \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.
- Her running speed is four times her walking speed.

First, calculate Dana's running speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, calculate her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a 6-hour period:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Calculate the distance traveled while running:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Calculate the distance traveled while walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Given the relationships between the ages of the iPhones:

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your remaining calorie target, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in the bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = \( 250 \, \text{calories/serving} \times 5 \, \text{servings} = 1250 \, \text{calories} \).

2. **Determine the calorie content per gram:**
   - The bag weighs 300 grams.
   - Calorie content per gram = \( \frac{1250 \, \text{calories}}{300 \, \text{grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \, \text{calories/gram} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = \( 2000 \, \text{calories} - 1800 \, \text{calories} = 200 \, \text{calories} \).

4. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Grams you can eat = \( \frac{200 \, \text{calories}}{4.17 \, \text{calories/gram}} \approx 48 \, \text{grams} \).

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how many potted plants Mary will have remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

   \]

2. Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will give away:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she already has:
   \[
   80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. Add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery:
   \[
   40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}
   \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(\boxed{58}\)."
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:

\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average each day for the next 4 days, we first calculate the total number of pages he needs to read:

\[ 4 \text{ (Science)} + 20 \text{ (Social Studies)} + 7 \text{ (History)} + 8 \text{ (Geography)} = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Given that he has 4 more days to complete his reading, the average number of pages he needs to read per day is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages/day} \]

Therefore, the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break down his consumption by days and then sum them up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed.
   - This amounts to 4 glasses of water per day.
   - Over 5 weekdays, this totals to \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner.
   - This amounts to 3 glasses of water per day.
   - Over 2 weekend days, this totals to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) glasses of water.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends:
\[20 \text{ (weekdays)} + 6 \text{ (weekends)} = 26 \text{ glasses of water}\]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We need to find the time \( x \) it takes to cover 42 miles. We can set up the proportion as follows:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \):
\[

\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

Given:
- Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour each night} \Rightarrow 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)
- Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Total hours watched: \(7 \text{ hours}\)

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours.

The equation for the total hours watched is:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplify the equation:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

"Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. This year, he intended to bake twice as many, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

First, we express the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."

"To solve the problem, we start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   The number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. The number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Given that Joseph's expenditure in May was $500 and it was $60 less in June, we can calculate his expenditure in June as follows:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, the total expenditure for May and June is \(\boxed{940}\)."
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred, we need to calculate the total number of rides they took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of roller coaster rides:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Total roller coaster rides = 2 + 4 = 6 rides.

Next, let's calculate the number of luge rides:
- Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each.
- Total luge rides = 2 + 2 = 4 rides.

Now, let's find the total number of rides:
- Total rides = 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (luge) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:

"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- The test consisted of 75 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

We need to work backwards from the end to find the initial number of fries.

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P_0 \) is the original price (\$20),
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20),
- \( n \) is the number of two-month periods in 36 months.

First, calculate the number of two-month periods in 36 months:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

Next, substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Now, multiply the original price by this factor:

\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget.

The costs of the items are as follows:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

First, we sum these costs:
\[
1090 + 157 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1580
\]

Elvira's budget is €1500. Since the total cost of the items is €1580, which exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €80.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each flan requires 3 eggs, so:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we can break it down as follows:

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. Therefore, the total miles for these 5 days is:
  \[
  20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. Therefore, the total miles for the weekend is:
  \[
  10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles}
  \]

- Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend gives the total miles walked in a week:
  \[
  100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}
  \]

Thus, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first calculate her total minimum monthly payment:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"
"Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:

"To determine the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:

   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

1. **Sentences Edited for Each Publisher:**
   Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and the total number of sentences is 1000, he edits:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher}
   \]

2. **Earnings from Publisher A:**
   Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Adding up all the slices of cheese used:

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is:
\[10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

\(\boxed{10}\)"
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour) into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day:
\[
500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250
\]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first calculate the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Given that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years. We start by determining their current ages based on the provided information.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

To find the average age in three years, we use the formula for the average:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Jojo scored. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Naomi's Points**: 
   \[ N = 68 \]

2. **Yuri's Points**: 
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Therefore,
   \[ Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10 = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

3. **Brianna's Points**: 
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore,
   \[ B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

4. **Total Points**: 
   The total points scored by the four students is 251. Let \( J \) be the points scored by Jojo. Then,
   \[ N + Y + B + J = 251 \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[ 68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251 \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[ 197 + J = 251 \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[ J = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"Given that Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and return by car, we need to calculate the total travel time.

1. The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days.
2. The car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half the time of the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

Therefore, the total travel time for the round trip is:
\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to update the counts of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The probability that a randomly picked card is a water type is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his burrito order and then subtract the value of the gift card.

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Count of Watermelons**: The farm initially produced 120 baby watermelons.

2. **Watermelons Ready After Two Months**: After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. Therefore, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   The remaining watermelons after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home are:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]

3. **Watermelons Ready After Two Weeks**: Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. Therefore, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   The remaining watermelons after harvesting these 63 are:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we start by calculating the daily tomato consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend. Given that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and his girlfriend eats half as much, we have:

\[ \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes consumed per day by both is:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per day} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed per week:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines required is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the redwood was eaten by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

\[ M_i + M_a + 20 = 20 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Step 2: Determine the number of trucks needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[
\boxed{16}

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total working time in minutes.
2. Determine the number of 10-minute intervals in the working time.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of intervals.

First, we find the total working time in minutes. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. She pauses for half an hour, so her actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Converting 2.5 hours to minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

\[ 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"Will buys 15 oranges. His sons will wash oranges based on their ages. The oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest is half as old, which is 4 years old. Therefore, the oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest will wash 4 oranges. The total number of oranges washed is \(8 + 4 = 12\).

The number of unwashed oranges is:
\[15 - 12 = 3\]

Thus, the final number of unwashed oranges is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Therefore, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.

Rice consumed per meal by the household = 5 members * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg per meal.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

Rice consumed per day = 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:

Rice consumed per week = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

Number of weeks = \(\frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}\).

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of her bids, which increase by $50 each time. Carmen makes 4 bids in total, starting from an opening bid of $200.

1. The first bid is $200.
2. The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

We sum these bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

Thus, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is:

"To determine the total annual cost John incurs for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost based on the miles driven and the monthly bonus.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven annually is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**

3. Find the number of books sold in the second year.
4. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

Given:
- Total books in the collection: 250
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books remaining unsold: 50
- Price per book: $20
- Books sold in the first year: twice the number sold in the current year

First, calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = \text{Total books in the collection} - \text{Books remaining unsold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Now, find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books sold} - \text{Books sold in the first year} - \text{Books sold this year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day for 5 days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. We need to calculate his total earnings for the month of April, assuming the company performed well for the entire month.

First, calculate Watson's daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Assuming April has 4 weeks, calculate his total earnings for the month:
\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]

   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
   \[
   5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total amount spent is:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The amount of money Dean has left after his purchases is:
   \[

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"

   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - He initially had $10.
   - Amount left after buying gumballs = \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had before buying candy:**
   - Billy spent half of his remaining money on gumballs.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{x}{2} = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount spent on candy = $6.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Thus, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one complete trip and then find out how many days it takes to accumulate 18,000 miles.

1. Calculate the distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Calculate the distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Calculate the distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

The total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

\(\boxed{20}\)"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we first calculate the amount required for a collie bed. Given that a collie bed uses the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds), we find the average as follows:

\[

"To determine the monthly payment Karan needs to make, we first calculate the total interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

The total interest on the principal amount of $3,650 is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services after the bundle discount.

1. **Calculate the total cost of streaming services before the discount:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu: $10 per month
   - Disney Plus: $10 per month
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount on the streaming services:**
   - The discount is 20%, so the cost after the discount is 80% of the original cost.
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

3. **Add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of streaming services} = 10 + 24 = 34 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

4. **Calculate the savings by comparing the cost of the cable package to the cost of the streaming services:**
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 60 - 34 = 26 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package is \(\boxed{26}\)."

"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to use the given probabilities and the total number of candles.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

"Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\(\boxed{350}\)"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtract 124 from both sides:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

\[ 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb:
\[ 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the number of feet Oliver must climb is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000, we get:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock. Four boats each carry away 5 cats, so the total number of cats carried away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats run after a mouse. The number of cats that run after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, the number of cats remaining on the rock is:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the sale price of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     28 - 6 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is:
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4
     \]

3. **Determine the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price.
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     x - 22 = 2 \implies x = 24
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - Therefore, the difference is:
     \[
     28 - 24 = 4
     \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
2. Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We can now calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder.

- Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

\[90 + 60 = 150\]

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is \(100 + 50 = 150\) dollars.

2. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: \(\frac{150}{1.5} = 100\) cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his cards and sells \(\frac{2}{3}\) of them.
   - Let \(x\) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He sells \(\frac{2}{3}x\) cards, which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150\).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

\(\boxed{150}\)"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog when 40 guests showed up, given the caterer's initial preparation.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - The first 18 guests each got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \(22 \times 1 = 22\) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \(36 + 22 = 58\) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6. 

Next, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, we add 4 more letters to this half to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Finally, we sum the number of letters in both names to get the total:
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy:

   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. **Prince Walter**: Slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. **Prince Bruce**: Slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we have:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many candy bars George bought, we start by calculating the total amount of money George spent. Given that he had 1% of his $5 left, the amount of money he spent is:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent gives us the amount spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we find the number of candy bars by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"To determine how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we start by calculating the number of lollipops Ray shared. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to distribute these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of shared lollipops by the number of friends:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Thus, each friend received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Therefore, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions needed.
2. Calculate the cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the cost of the beef stock.
4. Find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

First, Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives the total cost of the ingredients:
\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we start by calculating the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack} + 2 \text{ packs} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs} + 4 \text{ packs} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to follow the steps carefully:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time James took to complete the triathlon and determine the time he spent on the run.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time James took for each segment of the triathlon:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- Bike ride: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. The total time for James is the sum of the times for the swim, bike ride, and run:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, the time James took for the run is \(\boxed{59}\) minutes."

Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the change Michael receives after buying the hay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
2. Determine the amount of hay the horse eats.
3. Calculate the total cost of the hay.
4. Determine the total amount of money Michael has and the change he receives after buying the hay.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse runs.**
The horse runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. Therefore, the distance is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of hay the horse eats.**
For every mile the horse runs, it eats 0.5 bails of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times 0.5 \text{ bails/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hay.**
Each bail of hay costs $3. Therefore, the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total amount of money Michael has and the change he receives.**
Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

   - Total cost for the regular ticket option: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.
   - We can set up the equation: $21 - ($15 + \( P \)) = $2

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   21 - 15 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   6 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 6 - 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 4
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine the cost per balloon after the price increase, we start by finding the initial cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, the cost per balloon is:

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Daily Consumption per Horse:**
   Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Total Daily Consumption for All Horses:**
   Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Total Consumption for Five Days:**
   The total consumption for five days is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Number of Bags Needed:**
   Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

Thus, the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

\(\boxed{38}\)"
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{112}\)."

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

The total number of oranges they brought together is:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is:
\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we set up the cost equations for each venue and solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by calculating the amount each used individually.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Given that a skein contains 364 yards, the amount Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Therefore, the amount her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and stick yield of the available wood types. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Frederick has $24 to spend.

First, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will provide:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, we calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will provide:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, Frederick can make more sticks by buying 2 x 8 pieces. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined.

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 3, if the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
From point 4, if the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by finding the rate at which one person can paint a house.

Given:
- One person can paint half a house in 5 days.

First, calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house:
\[ \text{Time for one person to paint a whole house} = 5 \text{ days} \times 2 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Next, determine the combined rate for 5 people:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Convert this time into hours:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3 \times C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

Using the first piece of information, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ C_O = S_O + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Then, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find the cost of the headphone set. Given that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48, we can calculate the cost of the headphone set as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44
\]

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[
\text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
\]

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, we calculate the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. The number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. The number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin and then find the difference between their ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we start by identifying the thickness of each book:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Next, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Then, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to make in the fourth week to meet her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."

2. **Determine the amount each person pays:**
   - Since the bill is split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \)

Therefore, you end up paying \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step, using the expertise of a math expert.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:

"To determine how many cups of coffee Juan must reduce, we start by calculating Octavia's daily coffee intake. The recommended daily amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate Juan's current daily coffee intake. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's current daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find the ages of his sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since each son needs one candle per year, the first son needs 12 candles and the second son needs 8 candles. Therefore, the total number of candles needed is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required. We divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\). This means James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in each week and then sum them up.

**First Week:**
- Judy reads 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Total reading time in the first week: \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find her reading rate in pages per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \].

Now, calculate the total pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \].

**Second Week:**
- Judy read a total of 100 pages.

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps given in the problem can be broken down as follows:

1. Take the starting value \( x \) and add half of it: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
2. Divide the result by 5: \( \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \).
3. Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12: \( \left( \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \right) \times (x - 12) \).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into the expression and simplify step by step.

1. Calculate \( x + \frac{x}{2} \):
   \[
   20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of one box.
2. Determine the total cost for 2 boxes.
3. Find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.
4. Calculate the cost per contact.

First, the original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

"Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans. According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, we can express \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) as follows:
\[ R = 0.99B \]
\[ G = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to convert all his coins into nickels, since each gumball costs 1 nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equivalent to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equivalent to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equivalent to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels remain as 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equivalent to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equivalent to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, we sum up all the nickels:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.**
Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection.
\[ 4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.**
There are 4 intersections.
\[ 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.**
There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

The total number of functioning street lights is \(\boxed{76}\)."

Thus, the total cost of John's physical therapy is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[
\text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
\]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

1. First, calculate the number of surfers who can stay upright:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

2. Next, determine the percentage of these surfers who are men. Since 60% of the surfers who can stay upright are women, the remaining 40% must be men:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by setting up the inequality based on the given information.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss.

The number of classes Manny attends is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

3. Find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.**

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.**

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.**

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the difference is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Given that the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, and this amount is half of the total earnings from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month are \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month are \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\)."
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

Step 1: Calculate the new price of each computer.
The original price per computer is $700. A 10% increase means we need to find 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]
So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 500 computers.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To determine the total calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each ingredient and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses 2 oz of ham.
   - Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up the calories from all the ingredients:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:

\[150 + 10 = 160\]

Therefore, the number of chairs left in the restaurant is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices were eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we start by determining the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. Given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that time:

\[
\text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time by finding the mean of the times taken by the cat and the dog:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Given that 8 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 9x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of students per group when 54 students are divided into 6 equal groups:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]
Each of the 6 groups will have 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many groups are required if the activity needs 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains 54, we divide 54 by the number of students per group needed for 12 groups:
\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]
This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed (6) from the total number of groups required (12):
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then sum them up.

1. **Weekdays Calculation:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekend Calculation:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total Chairs in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total Chairs in Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is \(\boxed{4000}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

"To solve the problem, we need to carefully track the trades and conversions of stickers and buttons.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

6. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 27 (small) + 20 (large) + 60 (small) = 107

"Let \( x \) represent the number of votes against the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of council members is 33, so the sum of the votes in favor and against is 33. This gives us the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"To determine the total number of bike rides Chase and Rider take in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the number of rides on the 5 usual days:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

2. Calculate the number of rides on the 2 special days:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

3. Add the rides from both sets of days:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \(W\). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\), we get:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Given that he charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 in a week, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7):

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower Rose initially picks.
2. Subtract the petals from the flowers she drops.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower:

- For the 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Next, we sum these values to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she loses:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.

The total number of petals lost is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtract the lost petals from the initial total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many S'mores each person can have after accounting for the marshmallows used and those dropped on the ground.

1. Calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean:
   \[
   9 \text{ (John's S'mores)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean's S'mores)} = 18 \text{ marshmallows}
   \]

2. Add the marshmallows dropped on the ground:
   \[
   18 \text{ (used marshmallows)} + 3 \text{ (dropped marshmallows)} = 21 \text{ marshmallows}
   \]

3. Subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the original amount:
   \[
   35 \text{ (original marshmallows)} - 21 \text{ (used and dropped marshmallows)} = 14 \text{ marshmallows}
   \]

4. Divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
   \[
   \frac{14 \text{ marshmallows}}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows per person}
   \]

Therefore, each person can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then sum these values.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - The two friends together use \(48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money John spent is \(\boxed{4500}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of cupcakes he already has:

\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate cupcakes)} + 40 \text{ (toffee cupcakes)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of cupcakes Paul should buy is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate the initial number of cars Joe has as follows:

\[ \text{Joe's cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much each student raised, we start by calculating the total amount of money raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day and half as many hours on the second day, which is 4 hours. Therefore, the total time she walked over the two days is:

\[8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours}\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in minutes is:

\[12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes}\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is \(\boxed{720}\) minutes."
"Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total number of cars:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. The number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. The number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. The number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[ 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy had is \(\boxed{27}\)."

"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we start by calculating the total distance \(D\) that the three kangaroos cover.

Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed \(v\) take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we consider the speed of the four turtles. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). Therefore, the combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[
\text{Money from working} = \$5000
\]
\[
\text{Money from brother} = \$200
\]
\[
\text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200
\]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[
\text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"To determine the change Thea received, we start by calculating the total amount of money she gave to the craftsman. Since she gave four $20 bills, the total amount is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the hat is $70. Therefore, the change Thea received is:
\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
10
\]"
"To determine how much money Craig has left, we start by calculating the total amount of money he initially has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons gives us the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Given the problem, we can summarize the information as follows:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for sets.

Let:
- \( M \) be the set of students good at math.
- \( E \) be the set of students good at English.
- \( |M| \) be the number of students good at math.
- \( |E| \) be the number of students good at English.
- \( |M \cap E| \) be the number of students good at both math and English.
- \( |M \cup E| \) be the total number of students.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |M \cup E| = 20 \) (total number of students).
- \( |M - E| = 5 \) (students good at math only).
- \( |E - M| = 8 \) (students good at English only).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:
\[ |M \cup E| = |M| + |E| - |M \cap E| \]

We can express \( |M| \) and \( |E| \) in terms of the given values:
\[ |M| = |M - E| + |M \cap E| = 5 + |M \cap E| \]
\[ |E| = |E - M| + |M \cap E| = 8 + |M \cap E| \]

Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\[ 20 = (5 + |M \cap E|) + (8 + |M \cap E|) - |M \cap E| \]
\[ 20 = 13 + |M \cap E| \]
\[ |M \cap E| = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( |M| \):
\[ |M| = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\(\boxed{11}\)"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - White shirts with collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - White shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference Calculation:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Therefore, there are \(\boxed{10}\) more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trays required to hold 900 eggs.
2. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of trays required.**

Each tray holds 30 eggs. Therefore, the number of trays needed is:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

The price per tray is $2.5. Therefore, the total earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine the number of goats left in both farms, we start by calculating the number of goats sold from each farm:

- From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm:

- In Farm X, the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- In Farm Y, the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we add the number of goats left in both farms to get the total:

\[45 + 25 = 70\]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, the total number of pairs he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a discount applied to the red food.

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the cost per basket of red food is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of the person asking the question is \(\boxed{13}\)."

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects 6 others every day.

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. Therefore, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtracting this from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ badges}
\]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
\[
3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges}
\]

The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year is:
\[
36 - 6 = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
   \[
   \text{Leftover burritos} = 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine the number of 3-ounce boxes required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids, with each kid having 4 jello cups:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of 3-ounce boxes required.**

Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we need to find out how many 3-ounce boxes are required to make 120 cups:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each 3-ounce box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Bacon**: Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon for a total of $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $4. Kelly buys 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly buys 3 packs of strawberries.
   \[

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we start by calculating the number of indoor plants. Given that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Then:
- The number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- The number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. According to the problem, the total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80. Therefore, we have:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). Since \( J \) must be a non-negative integer, we can test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Total Soup Capacity**: The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. **Family's Soup Consumption**: Calvin and his wife (2 adults) and their 2 children will each have 1 bowl of soup for dinner. This totals to 4 bowls (2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls).

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can also fill 8 child bowls. After the family has eaten their 4 bowls, we need to determine how much soup is left.

3. **Soup Left After Dinner**: The pot originally had enough soup for 4 adult bowls, and the family consumed 2 adult bowls. Therefore, the remaining soup is equivalent to 2 adult bowls.

4. **Converting Remaining Soup to Child Bowls**: Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ adult bowls}}{4 \text{ adult bowls}} \times 8 \text{ child bowls} = 4 \text{ child bowls}

"Given the problem, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

The relationship given is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:

"To find the total number of acres for both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms, we start by determining the size of each farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Therefore, we calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:
\[ 2 \times 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add the sizes of both farms together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Thus, the total number of acres for both farms is \(\boxed{700}\)."

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is \(\boxed{64}\) dollars."
"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
2. Determine how many bottles of water John drinks in that time.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs, we start by calculating the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   We sum the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks per trip. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"Given the initial conditions, we start by calculating the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10,000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days if it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water that will be emptied in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning is 17 hours total, so 17 - 12 = 5 hours).
- The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:

"To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons.
2. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.
3. Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has.

First, the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from coupons is:
\[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, there are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:
\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount.
2. Apply the 40% discount to find the total cost after the discount.
3. Calculate the total amount James gets from selling 5 of the CDs.
4. Determine the net amount James is out after selling the CDs.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount is:
   \[
   10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
   \]

2. Applying the 40% discount:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60
   \]
   So, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   \$150 - \$60 = \$90
   \]

3. James sells 5 of the CDs for \$40 each:
   \[
   5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
   \]

4. The net amount James is out after selling the CDs is:
   \[
   \$90 - \$200 = -\$110
   \]
   Since the result is negative, it means James made a profit of \$110. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context means the initial expenditure. Therefore, the amount he was out is:
   \[
   \boxed{\$90}
   \]"

   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - Original speed: 2 miles per hour
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \)

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance: 8 miles
   - New speed: 1 mile per hour
   - Time to swim 8 miles: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours
   - Rest time: 3 hours
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Given that the paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first calculate the total time he spent stapling in minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each interval, the total number of reports stapled is:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Occupancy Calculation:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \(\frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200\) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \(1000 - 200 = 800\) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \(50 \times 14 = 700\) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \(200 + 700 = 900\) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can determine his age as:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, the age of Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Given that Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly stated that this number was 20% higher than the actual number of attendees, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of attendees. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

According to the problem, Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey. Therefore, the number of corn chips Collins received is:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the total cost of travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.

\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can determine the number of episodes as follows:

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."

To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we start by calculating the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"Let \( x \) represent the number of states in the USA. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

Given that the USA has 50 states, we substitute \( x = 50 \) into the expression:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the books:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from his total savings:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = 39 - 14 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we calculate the number of hours he needs to work to earn the remaining amount:

\[
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the number of hours Tyler needs to work is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

1. We know Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries}
   \]
3. The total number of cherries is 60. Therefore, the number of cherries Jerry has is:
   \[
   60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries}
   \]
4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we calculate:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

Thus, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"To determine the number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of crawfish caught on each day.
2. Sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days.
3. Divide the total amount by the serving size to find the number of servings.

First, we know that on Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we determine the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we have:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Next, we find the number of students remaining after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the number of cheerleaders and band members is:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Thus, the number of students leaving early is:

"Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we use the formula for the average:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]"

2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and there are 5 baskets:
   \[
   \text{Total petunias} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

2. Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines, and there are 5 baskets:
   \[
   \text{Total sweet potato vines} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. The cost of each petunia is $3.00:
   \[
   \text{Cost of petunias} = 15 \times 3 = 45
   \]

4. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50:
   \[
   \text{Cost of sweet potato vines} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25
   \]

5. Adding the costs together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 45 + 25 = 70
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"To determine how many roses can be planted, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil. Since 4 sunflowers are planted, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. Since 10 carnations are planted, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations gives:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of roses that can be planted is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first calculate her monthly savings for shoes. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. Therefore, her monthly savings for shoes is:

\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we calculate her total savings for shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, her annual savings for shoes is:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

\(\boxed{6}\)"
"To determine the total time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes separately and then sum the times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily sautés 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she sautés 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since the peeling and sautering processes are sequential, the total time is the sum of the individual times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"To determine the final temperature change, we need to account for the cooling and warming effects step by step.

1. **Cooling on Low Setting for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High Setting for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming for 2 Hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To determine Bill's age when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age at the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Summing up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the howls of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous in minutes.

1. **Tobias's Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howl Duration:**
   - The total duration of the howls is the sum of the individual durations:
   \[
   20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert Total Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the total duration in minutes is:
   \[
   \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."

"Given the problem, we need to find the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are provided with the following information:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the reception. Given that there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we start by defining the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Consequently, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is:
\[2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\]

The total size of the watermelon is \(8x\). Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   - Total population of porcupines = 50.
   - Number of female porcupines = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30\).

2. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Number of baby porcupines born each month = \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

3. **Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of baby porcupines born in a year = \(120 \times 12 = 1440\).

4. **Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:**
   - Initial number of porcupines = 50.
   - Number of baby porcupines born in a year = 1440.
   - Total number of porcupines after a year = \(50 + 1440 = 1490\).

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is \(\boxed{1490}\)."
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substitute the values:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculate the product:
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculate the cost:
\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Given the problem, we can determine the total number of sticks as follows:

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of red sticks. We are given \( R = 9 \).
2. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we have \( B = R + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \).
3. Let \( Y \) represent the number of yellow sticks. Since there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, we have \( Y = B - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \).

To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
\[ \text{Total sticks} = R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each person traveled using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

\[
\boxed{230}

   \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we will follow these steps:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

\[

"To determine the remaining capacity of the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to account for the charge loss over the 8-hour period.

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the remaining charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the remaining charge is \( x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \).

3. **Final charge:**
   - After 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28% of the initial charge.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

Now, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Substituting these values into the equation:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we first calculate her total hourly earnings from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we calculate the amount she needs to save for the down payment, which is 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Janet works 40 hours a week, so her weekly earnings are:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we start by calculating the total number of sweets Anne purchased:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of sweets given to her friends:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we divide the total number of sweets given to her friends by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia has, we start by calculating the number of pictures per album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them evenly into 8 albums, we find:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

Next, we know that 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[
\text{Selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[
\text{Portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is \(\boxed{98}\)."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold \(\boxed{12}\) small stuffed animals."

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the complementary probability of him not having to turn it in.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

The total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is \(\boxed{89.8\%}\)."
"To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find the number of seats available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Thus, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the answer.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium jelly bean is:
     \[
     3 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

"Let \( x \) represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, calculate the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles required.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles required.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

"To determine the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost for both small and big coupons and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times \text{Number of small coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for small coupons:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for small coupons} = \text{Number of small coupons} \times \text{Cost per small coupon} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for big coupons:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for big coupons} = \text{Number of big coupons} \times \text{Cost per big coupon} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for small coupons} + \text{Cost for big coupons} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500 \text{ cents}}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza originally had and then find out how much they have left after spending a portion of their money.

Let's start with Maggie:
- Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left.
- This means that $60 is three-quarters of her original amount of money.
- Let \( M \) be Maggie's original amount of money. We can write the equation:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4}M = 60
  \]
- Solving for \( M \):
  \[
  M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
  \]
- So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, let's consider Riza:
- Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left.
- This means that $60 is two-thirds of her original amount of money.
- Let \( R \) be Riza's original amount of money. We can write the equation:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3}R = 60
  \]
- Solving for \( R \):
  \[
  R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
  \]
- So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Over a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   Over a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315. Therefore, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas per day}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

2. He then completed another 500-piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of that puzzle.

Adding these together, the total number of pieces Teddy placed is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Each rose costs $1.25, so the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes from the start).
   - Stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Leaves after 45 minutes (30 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (60 minutes from the start).
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it leaves at 60 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (80 minutes from the start).
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Since Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes) and the fourth train arrives at 80 minutes, Paul will wait for 80 minutes.

"Let \( x \) be the initial amount of meat on the triceratops in kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first calculate the total area of the walls.

The north and south walls each have an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, their combined area is:
\[2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}.\]

The east and west walls each have an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, their combined area is:
\[2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet}.\]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}.\]

Next, we calculate the number of gallons of paint needed. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}.\]

Given that each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we first calculate the distance each train travels in that time.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it covers:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it covers:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[
180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. However, the problem does not provide the number of people in each car or bus that actually attended the ceremony. Therefore, based on the information given, we can only calculate the maximum possible number of people that could have been transported by the vehicles.

Given:
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- There were 12 buses.
- There were 20 cars.

First, calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Since the problem does not specify how many of these people actually attended the ceremony, the final numerical answer based on the given information is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"

- Speed = 80 feet/minute
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

The difference in time is:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it takes \(\boxed{2}\) minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days, we start by calculating the daily time spent:

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, totaling \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes

Thus, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour, the total time spent over 5 days is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"Given that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles, and knowing that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran \(\boxed{16}\) miles."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00

"Let \( J \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we start by calculating the total production of the first four workers.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total production of all five workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ 180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"Let's define the number of eggs painted by each person with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Finally, we find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).
2. For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. The additional number of bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:**
   - Total number of octuplets = 8
   - Number dressed in purple = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
   - Number dressed in blue = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

2. **Calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
   - \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\).

3. **Find the total number of bow-wearers:**
   - Total number of bow-wearers = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

4. **Determine the probability that a bow-wearer is wearing purple:**
   - Number of purple-wearers wearing bows = 2
   - Total number of bow-wearers = 4
   - Probability = \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)

5. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - \(\frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%\)

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \(\boxed{170}\)."
"Given that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, and Haley is 26 years old, we can express Geb's age mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Haley's age} - 10
\]

Substituting Haley's age into the equation:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 - 10
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = 13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Face masks per outing**: Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out.
2. **Outings per day**: Tyrion goes out 3 times a day.
3. **Face masks per day**: Since he changes his face mask 2 times per outing and goes out 3 times a day, the number of face masks used per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outtings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]
4. **Face masks in 2 days**: If he uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days he will use:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each person found and then subtract the total number of found eggs from the initial number of hidden eggs.

1. Cole hid a total of \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
2. Lamar found 5 eggs.
3. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
4. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
5. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, we sum the number of eggs found by all the participants:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of found eggs from the initial number of hidden eggs:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments across all three complexes.
3. Determine the total number of collections per week.
4. Calculate the total earnings based on the payment per collection.

First, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, the total number of apartments in all three complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

Given that he gets paid $0.40 per collection, his total earnings in a week are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the production for each year based on the given information.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). Thus, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1650}\)."

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28, \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and half of it is yellow, we can determine that 6 pints of the paint are yellow. The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. Therefore, the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is \(12 - 6 = 6\) pints. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3:

\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Thus, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can use the concept of geometric progression. Each day, the number of puffs doubles from the previous day.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

The sequence of puffs is: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. This is a geometric sequence with the first term \(a = 3\) and common ratio \(r = 2\).

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

For \(n = 5\), \(a = 3\), and \(r = 2\):
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{2^5 - 1}{2 - 1} = 3 \frac{32 - 1}{1} = 3 \times 31 = 93 \]

Therefore, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
3. Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1.

First, the special size box contains 20% more pods than the regular box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach, ensuring each step is clear and logical.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we start with the initial length of the chalk, which is 5 inches. On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, leaving 55% of the chalk.

The remaining chalk after Monday is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let \( C_n \) be the length of the chalk after \( n \) days. The length of the chalk after each day can be expressed as:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n \times 0.80 \]

We start with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches. We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[ C_n < 2 \text{ inches} \]

Calculating the length of the chalk each day:
\[ C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]
\[ C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]
\[ C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches} \]
\[ C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches} \]
\[ C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches} \]

Since \( C_5 = 0.90112 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we start by calculating the number of girls and boys on varsity.

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Determine the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is \(4 + 7 = 11\).
3. The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
4. The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since each set of 100 books costs $500, the number of sets he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Therefore, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine the number of apples Newton brought home, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up both apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so he now has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so he now has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices required for her 6 friends.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Thus, the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of whole cheese and pepperoni pizza pies required.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate the net gain of snowballs per 15-minute interval and then find the total time required.

1. **Net Gain per 15 Minutes:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals needed is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we find the number of fish remaining after removing those with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

From the remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes, we add the two quantities:

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles required for all four dogs based on the given average.

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:

3. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ people}
   \]

To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the bus's capacity:
\[
200 - 180 = 20 \text{ people}
\]

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new cost of one visit after the increase.
2. Determine the total number of visits over the 8 years.
3. Calculate the total expenditure based on the new cost and the total number of visits.

**Step 1: Calculate the new cost of one visit.**
The original cost of one visit is $2. The cost increased by 150%, so the increase is:
\[ 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]
Thus, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of visits.**
Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she made:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits} \]
Over the next 3 years, she made:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]
So, the total number of visits is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ visits} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total expenditure.**
The total amount spent is the number of visits multiplied by the cost per visit:
\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for all students to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.**

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube by summing the time taken for each side.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not explicitly mentioned, but since the problem states that once the fifth side is solved, all six sides are solved, we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time and takes the same time as the fourth and fifth sides, which is 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is:

\[

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. The selling price is the cost price plus 25% of the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's current age.
2. Use Dora's age to find James's current age.
3. Calculate John's current age.
4. Determine the age of the youngest son when John was 32.
5. Calculate the youngest son's age in 3 years.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.
2. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.
4. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of John's youngest son in 3 years is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 - 15 = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the discounted cost of the radiator:**
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: \( 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \)

2. **Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours required: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices available. Given that there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among the 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends). Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
