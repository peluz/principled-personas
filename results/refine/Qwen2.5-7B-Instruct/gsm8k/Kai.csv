"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"Kai: 

To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the distance James runs in one sprint session:
   - James runs 3 sprints in one session.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Therefore, the distance for one session is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters.

2. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Each session is 180 meters.
   - Therefore, the total distance for the week is \(3 \times 180 = 540\) meters.

So, the total meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total feed given in these two meals is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Each pair of glasses (one at full price and one at 60% of the full price) costs $8.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

So, the cost for each pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we have:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

The total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to account for the download speed, the restart, and the subsequent download from the beginning.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of \(60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

On his return trip, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering \(30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}\). Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering \(80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance covered on the return trip is \(0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}\).

\(\boxed{45}\)"
"Given Eliza's work schedule and pay rates, we can calculate her total earnings for the week as follows:

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{460}

"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

It is also given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equation to find their current ages:

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Therefore, Allen's current age is:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"

"Given that John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate his speed as follows:

1. Let \( v \) be John's speed in miles per hour.
2. On the first day, he runs \( 3v \) miles.
3. On the other two days, he runs \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles each day.
4. The total distance run in a week is:
   \[
   3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]
5. We know the total distance is 60 miles, so:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]
6. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, the number of teachers is:

\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Kai: To determine how much money Bailey started with, we need to account for the total amount she received from her weekly allowance and subtract it from her final total.

Bailey received $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with \(\boxed{60}\) dollars."
"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching these students.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes in a week.**

- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday).
- There are 5 weekdays, so the total number of classes from Monday to Friday is:
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
  \]
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is:
  \[
  25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.**

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students in a week is:
  \[
  33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching these students.**

- Judy charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is:
  \[
  495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}
  \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7425}

\[ 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

The total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
\[ 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"Kai: 

To determine the monthly payment for Shiela, we first calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{255} \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we start by determining the square footage of each level. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. **Top level (Level 1):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 2:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 3:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 4:** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ \boxed{7.5} \]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \(180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

2. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed for the first 180 days:
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \(\frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636\).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
3. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4D = 400
   \]
4. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
   Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.
5. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
   \[
   \frac{400}{2} = 200
   \]
   So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
6. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100
   \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"To determine the savings, let's first calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way.

   \]
2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. A boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:
   \[
   8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the second equation to find \( W \):
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam at all.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"Kai: 

To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box to find the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

Since Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, the amount he would earn if he spent his video game time working instead is:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{\$140}\)"
"Kai: 

The total cost of the food items is $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5. 

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10. 

With a 10% tax on the non-food items, the tax amount is $10 * 0.10 = $1. 

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is $10 + $1 = $11. 

Adding the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax, the total cost is $5 + $11 = $16.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

1. **Total Number of Clients:**
   Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients is:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]

2. **Expenses per Client:**
   Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for each client is:
   \[
   2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9
   \]

3. **Total Expenses:**
   For 8 clients, the total expenses are:
   \[
   8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72
   \]

4. **Total Income:**
   Kim's total income each week is given as \$92.

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses:
   \[
   \$92 - \$72 = \$20
   \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Kai: Given the details, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.
2. There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
3. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.

First, calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \]

Since John has 10 hectares:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, determine how many harvests John can make in a year. There are 12 months in a year, and he harvests every 3 months:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Kai: Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up from the floor. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces.

\(\boxed{2125}\)"
"To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 30 bees return. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. **Last 6 hours**: All the bees that left in the first 12 hours (30 + 60 = 90) return to the hive.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

**Final Answer:**
90"
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:

Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we calculate the number of friends James has as follows:
\[4D = 4 \times 4 = 16\]

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came to inflate all their tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came to inflate their tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Converting cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

   \[
   1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert the total length to feet:**
   \[
   3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2-month period:

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances they run:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.
- The difference is \(3000 - 2720 = 280\) yards.

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given a 20% increase every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20),
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20),
- \( n \) is the number of periods (18).

First, calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Now, multiply the original price by this factor:

\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

"The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?

Let's break it down:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"Given the ages of the birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
- Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
- Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
- Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

The total age of the four birds is:
\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first calculate her total minimum monthly payment:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the total amount Jessica pays in a year is \boxed{18000}."

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Calculate the revenue per gallon of lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons they sold to make $25 in profit:**
   - Total profit: $25
   - Number of gallons sold = Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Given Zaid's monthly salary of $6000, we can calculate his expenses and remaining amount step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount given to wife} = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver, we start by finding the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. Given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation:

\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses. Therefore:

\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):

\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can determine Jean's age by first finding Mark's age.

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 212 \text{ seconds} = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"
"Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly consumption for the flock. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks, the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly consumption into a daily consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Kai, with a background in forestry, can provide a detailed analysis of the tree population over the given period.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:

"Kai, the copy-editor, edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Kai edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, with Publisher A paying 5 cents per sentence.

First, we calculate the number of sentences edited for each publisher:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Kai earns:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives Kai's total weekly earnings:

"Given the problem, we need to find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy. The bag contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we determine the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \text{g} \]"
"Kai: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to find the cost per cup. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Half a Dozen Plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Cost of Twenty Dozen Cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Cost per Cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the costs and earnings step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Items:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - Shoes (2 pairs): $20 each, so $20 * 2 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Earnings from Babysitting:**
   - Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20

3. **Initial Savings:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved.

4. **Total Money Needed:**
   - Total money needed: $70 (cost of items)
   - Money Sara already has: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (earnings from babysitting) = $30
   - Additional money needed: $70 - $30 = $40

5. **Earnings from Mowing the Lawn:**
   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
   - To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the additional money needed by the earnings per mow: $40 / $4 = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, the number of hours Lori needs to work is \(\boxed{44}\)."
"Kai, with a background in financial planning, can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Given that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we use the formula for the average:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Naomi's Points**: 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Points**: 10 more than half of Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. **Brianna's Points**: 17 points more than Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. **Total Points**: 251 points.

To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

"Given the scenario, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21

1. **Number of pen pals left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters sent and received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters.

3. **Letters Mike sends**: Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

4. **Total pages written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

5. **Time spent writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

6. **Convert minutes to hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3.6}

"Kai: 

Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. He makes 15-minute calls with his boss every day for 30 days, which totals to \(15 \times 30 = 450\) minutes. Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other calls. Therefore, the total minutes used this month is \(450 + 300 = 750\) minutes. 

Subtracting the total minutes used from his monthly plan, we get \(1000 - 750 = 250\) minutes left.

Final answer: 250 minutes."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, let's break down the calculation step by step.

1. **Daily Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Total Cost for 5 Weeks:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Total cost before discount = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

4. **Applying the 10% Discount:**
   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
   - Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each ate over the two days and then convert that into calories.

First, let's find out the number of cookies each ate on Monday and Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so in total, she ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies. Therefore, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Each cookie has 200 calories.
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories:
- The difference is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

\[
\boxed{5600}

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Last Night's Hunt:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Hunt:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cougars killed today.
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night, so \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Hunt:**
   - Cougars: \( C = 12 \)
   - Wolves: \( 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \)

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves: \( 10 + 36 = 46 \)

"To determine the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the total time for digging the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for digging the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

3. Calculate the total time for both small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."

"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. With 40 cobras, each having 70 spots, the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. With 60 mambas, each having 35 spots, the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members, each bringing 2 guests, and 3 coaches. So, the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\). Adding the team members and coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas required is \(\frac{39}{3} = 13\). Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is \(13 \times 15 = 195\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{195}\)."
"Kai, a jewelry designer with expertise in topaz necklaces, can provide the following detailed solution:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:**
   The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length:**
   Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
   \[
   17 \text{ inches} \div \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:

"Kai: Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, Kelly has \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

So, \(145 - 55 = 90\) cents.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

This means there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars. The total number of stars on the flag is 76, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

\(\boxed{8}\)"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{kg per meal} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The population six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"Kai, with a background in mathematics and problem-solving, can provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.

First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kgs/marble} = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

"To determine how much Shannon’s iced coffee is weakened, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional weakening from the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, let's calculate the net pay for both jobs step by step.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
2. Find the total number of plant pots needed.
3. Subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots April bought.

First, the school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. Therefore, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then find out how many days it takes to reach the service interval.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

Given that Sara currently has 8 points, and Erin now has three times more points than Sara after scoring 14 points, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total, we can find her points before scoring by subtracting 14 from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan needs to make, we first calculate the total interest for the five months. Given the annual interest rate of 10%, the interest for five months is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times \left(\frac{10\% \times 5}{12}\right) = 3650 \times \frac{50}{1200} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{24} \approx 152.08 \]

Adding this interest to the principal amount gives the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Additionally, Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add Axel's and Anna's silver and gold pesos:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos:

\[150 + 200 = 350\]

"Kai, with a background in business and economics, can provide a refined response to the lemonade stand scenario.

First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total time:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

"The choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 0.5 \times 26 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of girls who perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

"To determine the energy savings, we first calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when used for 8 hours a day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, so for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the energy consumption if the usage is reduced to 3 hours a day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles will explode.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of candles**: 50,000
2. **Percentage of candles that will explode**: 1%
3. **Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog**: 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode. Assuming the defects are independent, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\(\boxed{350}\)"

1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each segment of the trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Total distance: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Distance: 30% of the first 4 days' total distance
   - Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next day (no travel):**
   - Distance: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Total distance: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Given the relationships between the lockers' sizes, we can determine the size of Timothy's locker step by step.

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker size is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker size is:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between where Oliver is standing and where the comb is located.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet), and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, the distance Oliver needs to climb is:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \boxed{3000} \]"
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000, we get:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years total 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:

"Kai: Given the information, we can calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. Let's calculate the total number of birds:

- Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

\[90 + 60 = 150\]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{150}\)."

   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He sells 2/3 of \( x \), which is 100 cards.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Kai: 

To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. Indras' name has 6 letters.
2. Half of Indras' name is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) letters.
3. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so it has \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) letters.
4. The total number of letters in both names is \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To find the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars

Adding these together gives:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount, which means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

The number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Kai: 

To determine how much gasoline Josey needed, we start by finding the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gasoline she needed in gallons:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the amount of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \text{ pints} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total money spent:**
   George had $5 and had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05. Therefore, the amount spent is:

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions needed.
2. Calculate the cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the cost of the beef stock.
4. Find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

First, Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:
\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the total time each person takes to reach the theater and then find the difference.

"Given the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we first convert the length to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle, \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \), we can find the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"

"Given the scenario, let's calculate the final temperature step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Kai, with my expertise in triathlon times and performance analysis, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer: \(\boxed{59}\)"

"Kai, with a background in horse racing and logistics, can provide a detailed and accurate response.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH):
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we determine the amount of hay the horse consumes. Given that the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

After the price increase of $20 per balloon, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

To find the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price, we calculate:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

Therefore, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. Calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Calculate the total distance traveled:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. Calculate the total time taken:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
   \]

5. Calculate the average speed:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
   \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."

"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
3. Add the two amounts together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to find the total number of cards of three colors: red, green, and yellow.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we first calculate the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**:

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Daily Oat Consumption per Horse:**
   Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Oat Consumption for All Horses:**
   Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Total Oat Consumption for Five Days:**
   The total consumption for five days is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Number of Bags Needed:**
   Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. Therefore, the number of bags required is:

"Kai: Given that Jana has 27 puppies and two thirds of them are Pomeranians, we can calculate the number of Pomeranians as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate the number of girl Pomeranians as:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first sum the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Summing these temperatures:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
\]

Dividing the sum by the number of countries (3):
\[
\frac{-30}{3} = -10
\]

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit.

\[
\boxed{-10}

"Kai: Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - With the ""buy one get one free"" sale, buying 2 packs means only paying for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost for both morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by calculating the amount each used individually.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein, and since a skein contains 364 yards, the amount Mariah used is:

\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein, so the amount her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total yards of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}

   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Adding 2 feet to this value gives the length of the couch:
   \[
   16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is \(\boxed{18}\) feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."

"Given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can determine the rate at which one person paints a house. The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting days into hours:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:

- Total sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\)
- Total chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Current Age:**
   - Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Determine the Age Difference Between Jame and His Cousin:**
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, find the total cost of the 2 monitors:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Adding these values together:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to make in the fourth week to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"The total bill including the 20% tip is $60. Since the bill is split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill, which is $30.

Final amount paid: $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Days in April**: 30 days.
2. **First Half of April**: 15 days.
3. **Second Half of April**: 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2x \) each day.

The total savings for the first half of April is:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April is:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings target is:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Given that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis saves each day in the second half of April is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).

Let's express the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

"Given that 90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days, and each box is $100.00 with a current 10% discount, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts if Pete buys 2 boxes.

First, calculate the discounted price of one box:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
\[ \text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \text{Cost per contact} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

Given the conditions:
- The number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( R = 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( G = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we have:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

   - Remaining amount: \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \)

3. Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:
   - George earns \$15 per hour
   - Hours needed: \( \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \)

Therefore, the number of hours George needs to work is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"Kai: Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to convert all of Colby's coins into nickels:
- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equivalent to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equivalent to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equivalent to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels remain as 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equivalent to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equivalent to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**
69"
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Next, we add the number of legs from all the pets together:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is:

\(\boxed{48}\)"
"Kai: 

Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 + 0.5 \times 8 = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. Therefore, the weight he now uses is:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that Jamaal now uses is \(\boxed{10}\) pounds."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ruiz's hourly production rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's hourly production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Marissa's hourly production rate:**
   - Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, so Marissa's hourly production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total production for 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's total production in 12 hours is:
     \[
     60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Marissa's total production in 12 hours is:
     \[
     90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
     \]

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we can break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

1. **First Four Hours:**
   - Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
   - Price per cup was $0.50.
   - Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
   - Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

2. **Next Two Hours:**
   - Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
   - Price per cup was $0.60.
   - Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
   - Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Given the constraints and the persona of Kai, let's refine the response:

Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out have a price of $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase.

First, calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost before tax:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will not be able to make the purchase.

The final amount of money Joe will have left is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

   - Total cost = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

2. **Cost to repave Lewis' street:**
   - Length = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

3. **Difference in cost:**
   - Difference = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is \(\boxed{65960}\)."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40\) months.
   - However, the problem states that the cost for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding per month.
   - The cost per month for the remaining 5 months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\)
   - Cost for the remaining 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\)
   - Total cost: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\)

The total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."

   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. Converting this to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. The height difference is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year. Converting this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much James made, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}
\]"

"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[

   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. 

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is \(\boxed{5}\) hours."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

   \]
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish Tommy caught} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by setting up the inequality based on the given information.

1. Total cost for the Karate classes: $60
2. Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

"To determine the time it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- Therefore, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"By 8:00, 5000 people lined up at the polling station. By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. This means:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \text{ people voted by midday.}
\]

So, the number of people remaining after midday is:

\[
5000 - 2000 = 3000 \text{ people.}
\]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. This means:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles as well (since it needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is 490."

For Ava:
- Enemies: \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- Berries: \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- Time: \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The scoring system is:
- 10 points per enemy
- 5 points per berry
- 30 points per second left on the timer

Emma's score:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

Ava's score:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish as \(W\). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\), we get:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total salary expense for all employees after three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:

   - Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 2 × 150 seconds = 300 seconds.

2. Calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
   - ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and it takes 240 seconds.
   - Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 1 × 240 seconds = 240 seconds.

3. Add the total times for both songs to get the overall caroling time:
   - Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds. 

\boxed{540}"
"To determine how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we need to calculate their respective earnings based on their hourly wages and the number of hours they work.

1. **Billy's Wages:**
   - Starting wage: $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.
   - Earnings for 20 hours: $11.50 \times 20 = $230.

2. **Sally's Wages:**
   - Starting wage: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour (since Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary).
   - Earnings for 20 hours: $10.50 \times 20 = $210.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - Billy's earnings: $230.
   - Sally's earnings: $210.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first calculate the total number of her current stuffed animals:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kai, with expertise in mosaic artistry, can provide a refined response:

Milo is making a mosaic using glass chips. Each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 glass chips. A bag of glass chips contains 72 chips, and Milo has two bags. Therefore, the total number of glass chips Milo has is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

To determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed per square inch:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to account for the tea consumed and the tea remaining.

First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
  \[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts:
  \[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:

"Given the scenario where the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[

   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**

"To determine the total amount of money used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"Kai: To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

"Kai, the chocolate factory expert, can provide the following refined response:

Boris owns a chocolate factory and produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. The production for the first three weeks is as follows:

1. **First week production:** 8,000 bars
2. **Second week production:** Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third week production:** Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

The total production for the first three weeks is:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Given the total monthly production is 50,000 bars, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:

"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we start by calculating the total distance \(D\) the kangaroos travel.

Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times v \times 18 = 54v \]
where \(v\) is the speed of one kangaroo.

Next, we calculate the speed of the turtles. Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, we add up the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. She also has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
   \[
   x + 150 + 80 = x + 230
   \]

3. We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Setting up the equation:
   \[
   x + 230 = 350

To determine the number of apple slices left, we first calculate the total number of slices from the apples Adam slices. 

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we start by calculating the current milk production. With 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day, the total production is:

\[ 3 \, \text{cows} \times 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer aims to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to meet his goal."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:

   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of Kai.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Kai is three years younger than his brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. Kai is two years older than his sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Their mom's age is one less than three times the brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, Kai is \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects 6 others every day.

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."

From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, Paige bakes for 5 hours. Given that she can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour, the total number of loaves baked is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ loaves/hour} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised is:

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount raised is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can determine the number of silver coins as follows:

\[ \text{Number of silver coins} = 70 - 30 = 40 \]

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"To determine the number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is \(500 + 20 = 520\).

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
- The initial number of burritos ordered is 600.
- The total number of burritos consumed is 520.
- Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Given the information:

- There are 12 red cars.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

**Final Answer:**

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
2. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so \( K = 3J \).
3. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so \( A = 5J \).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A = 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). Since \( J \) must be a non-negative integer, let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"Given the constraints and the persona of Kai, let's refine the response:

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed is:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, the total amount of soup in the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls. After the family eats their bowls, the remaining soup is:
- 4 adult bowls - 4 bowls eaten = 0 adult bowls

Since there are no adult bowls left, there is also no soup left for the children to have additional bowls for lunch. Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine how much William spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50. Since William bought five notebooks, the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]

2. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. Since William bought one ballpen, the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]

3. Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00. 

\[
\boxed{8.00}

"To determine the amount of material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down step by step.

First, calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material required = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is \( \boxed{16} \) yards."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, we calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Next, we calculate the average price per ticket:
- Deepa spent $216 in total.
- The total number of tickets is 27.
- Therefore, the average price per ticket is \(\frac{216}{27} = 8\).

The average price she paid per ticket is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Kai: 

To determine Harold's free time, we need to account for his daily activities and subtract them from the total hours in a day.

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Adding up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ (working)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. Subtracting the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"Kai here. Let's break down the problem step by step.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.
2. We know Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
4. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
5. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
6. Solving for \( A \):
   \[
   52 = 2A - 8
   \]
   \[
   52 + 8 = 2A
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2A
   \]
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
7. Adam's current age is 30. In 8 years, Adam will be:
   \[

"Given the problem, let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

"Kai: Given that Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles and he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, we can calculate the total miles driven in a month as follows:

\[ \text{Total miles driven} = 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{miles} \]

Since a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups required:

\[ \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Kai: To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   We sum the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days is:

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by two.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2:

"To determine the profit from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - The total calories from all pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories from the pastries is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

"Given the problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes of stuff. Therefore, the total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Thus, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue generated by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

   \]

Therefore, Cameron would save \(\boxed{250}\) pesos."
"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the hay requirement for each type of animal.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives the total hay required:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"Kai, with a background in financial planning and budgeting, can provide a detailed and accurate response.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount spent on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   \[
   10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
   \]

2. **Apply the 40% discount:**
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \$150 - \$60 = \$90
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount James gets from selling 5 CDs:**
   \[
   5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
   \]

4. **Determine the net amount James is out:**
   \[
   \text{Net amount} = \text{Total cost after discount} - \text{Amount from selling CDs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net amount} = \$90 - \$200 = -\$110
   \]

Since the net amount is negative, it means James made a profit of \$110. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context means the initial expenditure.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$90}
\]"

"Given the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Thus, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

"Given the hospital's capacity of 1000 beds, initially 1/5 of the beds are occupied. This means:
\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]
Thus, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Over 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. Therefore, the total number of new admissions is:
\[ \text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Adding these new admissions to the initially occupied beds gives the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:
\[ \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
\[ \text{Total unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of attendees. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be written as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

4. **Fourth Day**: The number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

The correct answer is:

Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so together they received:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the total cost of travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the $400 cost of supplies.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original cost of supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:

"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."

- Nani is 8 years old.
- Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so he is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.
- Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age, so she is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \[
   3 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \[
   5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \[
   4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up all the times:
\[
45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"Kai here. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The price of each phone is $600.

1. The first two phones are at full price:
   \[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

2. The remaining two phones are at half price:
   \[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]
   \[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

3. Adding the cost of all four phones:
   \[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Given that Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Kai: Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, totaling 4 boxes given away.
3. Therefore, the number of boxes left is \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes.
4. She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) boxes.
5. The number of boxes she sold is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.
6. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the books:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work is:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, the number of hours Tyler needs to work is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Both cars cost a total of $160.

"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find the current ages:

- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

- **Thursday**: Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- **Friday**: Joe caught 4 times the amount from Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- **Saturday**: Joe caught half the amount from Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Given that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the total number of servings:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

"To determine the number of students leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we have:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Next, we find the number of remaining students after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the number of cheerleaders and band members is:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Thus, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we use the formula for the average:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the number of each type of plant required and then find the total cost based on their respective prices.

1. **Calculate the total number of petunias needed:**
   - Each basket requires 3 petunias.
   - Total baskets = 5.
   - Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:**
   - Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Total baskets = 5.
   - Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

3. **Determine the cost of the petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

4. **Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
   - Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:

"Kai: 

To determine how many roses can be planted, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil. With 4 sunflowers, the total soil used is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. With 10 carnations, the total soil used is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

Since they started with a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil available for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

So, the final answer is:
\[

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily sautés 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she sautés 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be done sequentially, the total time is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \boxed{45} minutes."
"The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. It ran on low for 3 hours and then on high for 4 hours. After that, it was turned off for 2 hours.

"Given that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we need to determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age at the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to account for each type of check he writes and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.
4. We need to find Wilfred's age.

First, let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we have:
\[ A = 3 \]
\[ B = 4 \]
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \(H = 2 \times \text{Average age}\), we can write:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now, substituting \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is \(\boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}}\)."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of chocolate bars per box.

First, let's find the total number of boxes sold:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
- Together, they sold \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

Next, we know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes in total, we can find the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost per session, per day, per week, and then per month.

1. **Cost per session:**
   - Studio rental: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total cost per session for students: \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars
   - Total cost per session: \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars

2. **Cost per day:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Total cost per day: \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars

3. **Cost per week:**
   - Number of days per week: 4 (assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks)
   - Total cost per week: \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars

4. **Cost per month:**
   - Total cost per month: \(480\) dollars

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

For Peter:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
Solving for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

For Martha:
\[ 7m = 56 \]
Solving for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"Given the initial population of porcupines in the park is 50, and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of baby porcupines born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Adding the initial population of porcupines to the total number of baby porcupines born in a year, we get the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Given the problem, let's calculate the total number of sticks:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Adding these together, the total number of sticks is:
\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we calculate the distance each traveled using the formula: distance = speed × time.

For Matteo:

   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"Kai: Given the information, let's break down the laps each person can run in one hour:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

\[
\boxed{5}

   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge. Let's denote the initial charge as \( x \).

After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

After the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"Kai: To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we first calculate her total hourly earnings from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we calculate the amount she needs to save for the down payment:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate her weekly earnings based on her 40-hour workweek:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Kai, with a background in economics and budgeting, can provide a refined response to the question.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars (initial price),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculating \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiplying by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the soda bottles and drop the candy.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the number of bottles is:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. The number of pizzas eaten by the glee club is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Adding the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:

"To determine the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost for both small and big coupons and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times \text{Number of small coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for small coupons:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for small coupons} = \text{Number of small coupons} \times \text{Cost per small coupon} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for big coupons:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for big coupons} = \text{Number of big coupons} \times \text{Cost per big coupon} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for small coupons} + \text{Cost for big coupons} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500 \text{ cents}}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is \(\boxed{245}\) dollars."

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:

"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Each rose costs $1.25, so the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals $25. The change she should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}

"Kai: To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first calculate the number of toothpicks she has already saved. Given that she saves 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, the total number of toothpicks saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to save 200 toothpicks is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount amount and then the percentage discount.

First, the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for is 75% of the original price:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for is 120% of the price he bought it for:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

The discount amount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas in 10 bunches:**
   - Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
   - Therefore, the total number of bananas is \(10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}\).

2. **Calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually:**
   - The cost per banana is $0.80.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00\).

3. **Calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:**
   - The cost per bunch is $3.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00\).

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of buying bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches.

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first calculate the total area of the walls.

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area for these two walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area for these two walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Given the information, we need to determine the number of people inside the church after the ceremony. The problem states that there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. Each bus carried 35 people, and each car carried 3 people. However, the problem does not specify the number of people in each vehicle that actually attended the ceremony.

To find the maximum possible number of people that could have been transported, we calculate:

- Total people transported by buses: \(12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people}\)
- Total people transported by cars: \(20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people}\)

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people}\]

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of people who attended the ceremony, the maximum possible number of people inside the church is:
\(\boxed{480}\)"
"Given the relationships and ages provided:

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

"The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Kai: After reviewing the details provided, we can calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day. 

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks. Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, over 5 days, the total time spent is:

\[60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}.\]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

\[300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}.\]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

**Final Answer:**

"Given the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles, while Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Kai: 

Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **New Balance:**
   Add the total new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce 400 toys in total and still needs 20 more toys after the first four workers have finished their shift. This means the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so if Arnold painted \( A \) eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted is 56.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Substituting \( S = 9 \) into \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

The number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Given the information, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Her brother earns twice what Valerie earns, so her brother earns:
   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]
3. Their combined salary is:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]
5. The total amount of money they all have together is:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is \(\boxed{45000}\)."
"Given that Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and knowing that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, we can determine the total time for her walk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Given: 40 minutes.

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so \( 40 = \frac{2}{v} \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

5. **Distance on the sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

6. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \) minutes.

7. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"Kai: To determine how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first calculate her current savings. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks, so her total savings so far are:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. Therefore, the additional amount she needs to save is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60 is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"Kai: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has:
   \[
   \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60
   \]
   Solving for the original number of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Kai pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Kai to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This simplifies to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Kai, with a background in real estate and land valuation, can provide a detailed analysis of the problem.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes have 200 apartments each.
   - Combined, they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections per week = \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money made in a week:**
   - He gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total money made in a week = \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). Thus, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, summing up the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{1650}

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( R \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we get:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, this amount is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Additional pods = \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Total pods in the special size box = \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - Cost per pod = \( \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \).

3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles for $1 is:
   - Number of cycles = \( \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \).

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we start with the initial length of the chalk, which is 5 inches. On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, leaving 55% of the chalk. This can be calculated as:

\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher then uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches. Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \). We start with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.

- After the first day, \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
- After the second day, \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.
- After the third day, \( C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \) inches.
- After the fourth day, \( C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \) inches.
- After the fifth day, \( C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \) inches.

Since \( C_5 = 0.90112 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since 100 books cost $500, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]

Finally, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies to find the total number of pizza pies:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens:
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

2. Calculate the number of black pens:
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
   - Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}\).

3. Calculate the total number of pens:
   - The total number of pens is the sum of the red pens and the black pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of pens is \(25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}\).

"Kai: 

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = \( \frac{600}{10} = 60 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) bottles of cognac.
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = \( 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost of Cognac:**
   - Total cost for 20 bottles of cognac = \( 20 \times 90 = 1800 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for scotch and cognac = \( 600 + 1800 = 2400 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is \( \boxed{2400} \) dollars."
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days, let's break down the information step by step.

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we start by calculating the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we determine the number of remaining fish after removing those with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Then, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes, which is \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining 44 fish:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Therefore, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Kai: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles required for all four dogs based on the average:

\[
\text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per day} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we sum the miles needed for the first three dogs:

\[
1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
\]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the overall total:

\[
12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"Kai here. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the loan amount:**
   - The house is worth $250,000.
   - John gets a loan worth 40% of the house's value.
   \[
   \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount used to pay off debts:**
   - John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.
   \[
   \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the leftover amount:**
   - Subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost Karen would pay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.
3. Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

"The toy's price in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Kai, the tennis pro, has a standard rate of $80 per hour for lessons. For veteran players, he reduces his rate by 25%, which means the rate for veterans is 75% of $80.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"To determine the total number of popped kernels, let's break down the popping rates and calculate step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels} \]

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \).
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \).

4. Subtract the first equation from the simplified second equation to eliminate \( c \):
   - \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \).
   - This simplifies to \( k = 15 \).

5. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   - \( c + 15 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, \( c = 5 \).

The number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
