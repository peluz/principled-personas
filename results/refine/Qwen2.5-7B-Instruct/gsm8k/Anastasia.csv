"Anastasia, with her expertise in farm management and economics, can provide a detailed analysis of Janet's egg sales.

First, let's break down the daily egg production and usage:

- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, totaling 7 eggs used per day.

Subtracting the used eggs from the total production gives us the number of eggs available for sale:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since each egg is sold for $2, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. Therefore, it requires 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, the robe requires:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"Anastasia, with her background in physical training and sports science, can provide a detailed analysis of James's weekly running routine.

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, the distance he covers in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Thus, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total feed given in these two meals is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to account for the pricing pattern: the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

1. Cost of the first glass: $5
2. Cost of the second glass: $3

So, the cost for each pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we calculate the number of pairs:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = \(60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = \(30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).
     - Distance covered = \(80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered = \(0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = \(180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"Eliza's earnings for the week can be calculated as follows:

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \boxed{460}."
"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we start by calculating the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Given that 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of remaining students after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we calculate the number of students left to enroll in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can follow these steps:

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

It is also given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equation to find their current ages:

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Therefore, Allen's current age is:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:

"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."

   \]
3. Aaron has 5 more than this amount:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find the points scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game gives the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
     \[
     3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the initial number of pieces minus the remaining pieces:
\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and current consumption, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate the grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips contains 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step:

   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

"Anastasia:

To determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time.
2. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.
3. Therefore, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.
4. He does this 3 times a week, so the total time spent in a week is \(3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\).
5. To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4: \(9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\).

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching these students.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes in a week.**

- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday).
- There are 5 weekdays, so the total number of classes from Monday to Friday is:
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"To determine the monthly payment for Shiela, we first calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, the monthly payment Shiela will make for 3 months is:

\[ \boxed{255} \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we start by determining the square footage of each level. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. **Top level (Level 1):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 2:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 3:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 4:** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ \boxed{7.5} \]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \(180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

2. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed for the first 180 days:
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \(\frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636\).

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
3. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4D = 400
   \]
4. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
   Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.
5. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
   \[
   \frac{400}{2} = 200
   \]
   Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
6. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100
   \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."

"Given the scenario, let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This can be expressed as:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

Thus, the average number of pages Solo needs to read each day is 6.

"Anastasia:

John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed, every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On weekends, he still has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together: 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We need to find the time \( x \) it will take to cover 42 miles. We can set up the proportion as follows:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \):
\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pieces**: Poppy starts with 1000 pieces.
2. **Poppy's Placement**: She places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy**: 
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. **Mom's Placement**: Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
5. **Remaining Pieces After Mom**: 
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

Given:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 one-hour episodes, so \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- Total hours watched: 7 hours.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

Therefore, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]
\[ 300 = 50D \]
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber she has.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Sasha bought ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 2x4x10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Sasha bought five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 4x4x10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total cost of all lumber:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total selling price:
- The price of 2x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is:
  \[
  10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total selling price for 2x4x10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The price of 4x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is:
  \[
  16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total selling price for 4x4x10 boards:
  \[
  5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total selling price of all lumber:
  \[
  150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, the profit is calculated as:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total selling price} - \text{Total cost} = 270 - 180 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."

   - Bags of chips: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)
   - Cookies: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

2. Sum the costs of the items:
   \[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

3. Calculate the 20% delivery fee:
   \[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

4. Add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
   \[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

5. Add the $5.00 tip:
   \[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- The test consisted of 75 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to find the number of pink gumballs in a candy machine. The relationship between the number of pink gumballs (\(P\)) and blue gumballs (\(B\)) is given by the equation:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are told that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Given the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Given the problem, let's define the variables and relationships:

- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queens).
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

Substitute \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"The total cost of the items before tax is calculated as follows:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Summing these amounts gives:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to identify which items are non-food:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of non-food items is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on these non-food items is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Adding the tax to the non-food items gives:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Anastasia, with her expertise in agricultural management, can provide a refined response to the question.

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up from the floor. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces.

"To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 30 bees return. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. **Last 6 hours**: All the bees that left in the first 12 hours (30 + 60 = 90) return to the hive.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:

"To determine how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[

  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. 

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
- \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

First, calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Next, multiply the original price by this factor:

\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of all the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €157 = €1404
3. €1404 + €74 = €1478
4. €1478 + €102 = €1580

The total cost of the items is €1580. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €80.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"Anastasia calculates the total minimum monthly payment for Jessica's debts as follows:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, she will pay:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
\[14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31\]

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has, we need to account for all the pens she initially had and the pens she bought.

"To determine the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- There are 80 candied apples.

First, we find the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \text{g} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we can break it down as follows:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Adding these together, the total number of cakes bought over the three days is:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To determine the cost per cup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Half a Dozen Plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Cost of Twenty Dozen Cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Cost per Cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first calculate the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Given that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Given the information, we can determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack as follows:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we calculate:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate Yuri's points:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we start by calculating the number of petunias. Given that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can find the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]

3. **Total Pens After First Cycle**: After using the 25 pens to make 5 new pens, Ram now has:
   \[
   25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]

4. **Using Remaining Pens to Make More Pens**: Now, Ram has 5 pens. He can use these 5 pens to make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]

5. **Total Pens After Second Cycle**: After using the 5 pens to make 1 new pen, Ram now has:
   \[
   5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \text{ pen}
   \]

6. **Final Check**: With 1 pen left, he cannot make any more new pens since he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:
\[
25 + 5 + 1 = 31
\]

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C from the remaining students after exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of 1000.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. The number of students who went out through exit B is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, and we know John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54

4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we calculate the difference:
   \[
   54 - 33 = 21
   \]

The final answer is:
\[

"Anastasia:

To determine how many hours Mike spends writing a week, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Pen Pals Left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters Sent and Received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters. Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

3. **Total Pages Written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

4. **Time Spent Writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

5. **Convert Minutes to Hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

"Anastasia:

Given that Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month, and he uses 15 minutes each day for a call with his boss, we can calculate the total minutes used for these calls over 30 days as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people. Therefore, the total minutes used this month is:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes, we get:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Total Cost for 5 Weeks:**

1. Calculate the number of cookies each ate on Monday and Tuesday.
2. Sum the total number of cookies for each.
3. Convert the total number of cookies into calories.
4. Find the difference in calories consumed.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies each ate on Monday and Tuesday.**

- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Sum the total number of cookies for each.**

- Sue's sister's total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue's total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) bedroom windows.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

The total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."

   \]

5. **Total stitches for the sleeves**:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. **Stitches for each sleeve**:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Therefore, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost for both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."

"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

First, we calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we first calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"Anastasia, with her expertise in time management and financial calculations, can provide a refined response as follows:

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which totals 3 hours. She takes a 30-minute break, so her actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Converting this to minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Therefore, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final amount Susan earns for the online task is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.

Rice consumed per meal by the household = 5 members * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg per meal.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

Rice consumed per day = 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:

Rice consumed per week = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

Number of weeks = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:

\[ \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Now, find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books sold} - \text{Books sold in the first year} - \text{Books sold this year} \]
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} \]
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?

To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings:
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day}
   \]

2. Calculate Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus:
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week}
   \]

3. Add the weekly bonus to the weekly earnings:
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week}
   \]

4. Calculate Watson's total earnings for April (assuming April has 4 weeks):
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for April} = \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200
   \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."

"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals as follows:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so:
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds

2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds
- Container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds.

\[

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

"To determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 she was given.

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal.
   - For 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).
   - Total cost for taffy: \(3 + 1.50 = 4.50\)

2. **Cost of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is: \(10 - 7 = 3\)

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies that total is.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to use the given percentages and the total number of candles.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is the product of the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle exploding:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 5\% \times 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of one blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

First, we calculate the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\(\boxed{350}\)"
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each segment of the trip.

1. **First 4 Days:**
   Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   Tom traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   \[
   800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next Day:**
   Tom did not travel at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second Week:**
   Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
\boxed{3140}

"Given the relationships between the lockers' sizes, we can determine the size of Timothy's locker step by step.

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker size is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker size is:

2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000, we get:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name:**

2. **Calculate the number of letters in Indras' sister's name:**
   - Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.
   - Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is \( 3 + 4 = 7 \).

3. **Find the total number of letters in both names:**
   - Indras' name has 6 letters.
   - Her sister's name has 7 letters.
   - The total number of letters is \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

"To determine how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we have:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

1. **Determine the total amount spent on chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.
   - Total cost for chips = \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying chips:**
   - George initially had $5.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - Remaining money = \(5 - 1.20 = 3.80\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount of money left after all purchases:**
   - George had 1% of his initial money left.
   - 1% of $5 = \(0.05\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars = \(3.80 - 0.05 = 3.75\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - Number of candy bars = \(\frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5\).

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack} + 2 \text{ packs} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate Jon's total time:**
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes

   Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. **Determine James's time for each segment:**
   - Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so James's time = 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes
   - Bike ride: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so James's time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes
   - Run: Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run.

3. **Set up the equation for James's total time:**
   James's total time = 36 + 85 + \( x \)

4. **Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:**
   \[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
   \[ 121 + x = 180 \]
   \[ x = 180 - 121 \]
   \[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."

- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."

4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's sorted play set.
2. Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information given.

Given that James's play set has 80 toys, and Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set, the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan currently has is \(\boxed{398}\)."
"To determine how much Daniel has to spend, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the amount Daniel has to spend is \(\boxed{27.00}\)."

"To determine how many cups of coffee Juan must reduce, we start by calculating Octavia's daily coffee intake. The recommended daily amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate Juan's current daily coffee intake. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's current daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is:

"Anastasia, with her expertise in budgeting and financial planning, can provide a detailed breakdown of Peter's spending and action figure purchases.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 for the week and he spends an equal amount each day, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

"To find the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating 30% of the price Herb paid for his house, which is $76,000.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

3. Add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
   - She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

2. **Determine the number of cups and dishes her friend brought:**
   - Her friend brought 40 cups.
   - Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so she brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

3. **Calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both:**
   - Total cups brought = Judy's cups + Friend's cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\)
   - Total dishes brought = Judy's dishes + Friend's dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\)

4. **Calculate the total number of utensils:**
   - Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = \(52 + 68 = 120\)

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Anastasia, with her expertise in optics and contact lens usage, can provide a detailed and accurate response.

First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
   - Saturday: 2 hours
   - Sunday: 1 hour
   - Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

2. Calculate the total hours worked by John:
   - Saturday: Twice as long as Jill, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns:

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Total calories burned: \(1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, we calculate the amount of water needed based on the calories burned:

- Water needed: \(\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\)

Therefore, the amount of water Hannah needs to drink is \(\boxed{800 \, \text{ml}}\)."
"Given the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

The number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

The number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}

"Given the constraints and the persona of Anastasia, let's refine the response:

Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out have a price of $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase.

First, calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost before tax:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will not be able to make the purchase with the given budget.

Thus, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by calculating the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
79 miles"
"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required for each type of digging and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half his soil digging rate through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Finally, we sum the time required for both the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time through soil + time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine the time it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum them up.

1. **Mowing Rate Calculation:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Time to Mow Half the Lawn:**
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Total time to mow the entire lawn: \(30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for apples is \(1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4\).

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4\).

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\)."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, we find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over ten years, we first need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend that to the total period.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years (120 months), Rong's total savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left(20 \text{ coins} \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), Neil's total savings are:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together, we get:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have saved together is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"To determine how much money John leaves with after his visit to the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the services and then subtract this from the amount he brought.

1. The cost of the vaccines is $20 each, and the dog needs 2 vaccines:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
   \[
   \text{Heartworm check} = 0.6x
   \]

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
   \[
   125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is \(\boxed{25}\)."

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Calculate the total cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
   \[

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches, which converts to:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation becomes:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles as well (since it needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:

- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the four pizzas, which is $64.
2. Subtract the cost of the two pizzas that are already known, which is $30. So, the cost of the other two pizzas combined is:
   \[
   64 - 30 = 34
   \]
3. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   34 \div 2 = 17
   \]

Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes \(\boxed{27}\) times a week."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish as \(W\). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\), we get:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = 5 - 17\]

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the additional students by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

**310**"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.
   - Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

4. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{79}\)."

"To determine the total amount of money used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - The amount of fragrance is the same as citrus zest, so it is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - The amount of sugar is the same as salt, so it is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it is \( 2s \) ounces.

2. Write the equation for the total amount of the salt scrub:
   \[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
   Divide the entire equation by 2:
   \[ z + 2s = 5 \]

3. Solve for \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
   \[ z = 5 - 2s \]

4. Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) positive. For example, if \( s = 1 \):
   \[ z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
   This satisfies the equation.

5. The amount of oil is \( 2s \):
   \[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate the initial number of cars Joe has as follows:

\[ \text{Joe's cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Joe then sells 20% of his cars:

\[ \text{Cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother:

\[ \text{Cars given away} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars:

\[ \text{Cars remaining} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much each student raised, we first need to find out the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we start by calculating the total distance \(D\) the kangaroos travel.

Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current milk production. With 3 cows, each producing 5 liters a day, the total production is:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to increase this to 25 liters a day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5600\)."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\(\boxed{11}\)"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the cumulative infections each day. 

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To find the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela, we start by calculating Rafaela's total tips. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, we have:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. Therefore, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtracting this from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Adding Rafaela's and Julieta's total tips together, we get:

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Anastasia:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the rope:**
   - The rope is 20 meters long.
   - The selling price is $2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \( 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \).

2. **Calculate the cost of the new rope:**
   - The new rope is also 20 meters long.
   - The cost price is $1.5 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \).

3. **Calculate the leftover money after buying the new rope:**
   - Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total revenue.
   - Therefore, the leftover money is \( \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \).

Thus, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine in how many years Melanie's age will be thrice her current age, we start by finding her current age. Given that in 10 years she will be 18 years old, her current age is:

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we start by calculating the number of indoor plants. Given that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we have:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Thus, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

2. **Establish Relationships:**
   - \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
   - \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

3. **Calculate Total Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 per mow.
   - Total earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6J \).
   - Total earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \( 6K = 6(3J) = 18J \).
   - Total earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \( 6A = 6(5J) = 30J \).

   Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns is:
   \[
   6J + 18J + 30J = 54J
   \]

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - The equation for total earnings is:
   \[
   L + 54J = 80
   \]

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). Since \( J \) must be an integer and \( L \) must be non-negative, we solve:
   \[
   L = 80 - 54J
   \]

6. **Determine Feasible \( J \):**
   - The smallest integer \( J \) that keeps \( L \) non-negative is \( J = 1 \):
   \[
   L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26
   \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{26}\)."

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   We sum the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days is:

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by two since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount each received from their mother is \(\boxed{14}\)."

"To determine the profit the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

The profit is:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{47}\)."
"Given that a loaf of bread has 24 slices, and considering that Abby can eat 2 slices a day while Josh can eat twice as much, we need to determine how many days the loaf will last.

First, calculate the daily consumption:
- Abby eats 2 slices per day.
- Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.

Together, they consume \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Now, to find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for \(\boxed{4}\) days."

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

Final answer: \(\boxed{4.5}\)"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks per trip. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"Given the initial conditions, the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half of this amount, which is:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

The tank is then emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the total amount emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \]

Therefore, the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Given the problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - Total distance of the lake: 20 miles
   - Percentage of the distance he swims: 60%
   - Distance swum initially: \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   - Speed: 2 miles per hour
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - Rest time is half the swimming time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - Original speed: 2 miles per hour
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \)

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance: 8 miles
   - New speed: 1 mile per hour
   - Time to swim 8 miles: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours
   - Rest time: 3 hours
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the New York Times.**

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.**

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.**

The total commission is:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Given that the book is printed on paper where 100 pages occupy 1 inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}

"Anastasia:

To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first calculate the total time he spent stapling in minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each interval, the total number of reports stapled is:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we first calculate the number of measuring cups:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we determine the number of measuring spoons he has:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. This means initially, 200 beds are occupied, leaving 800 unoccupied. Over 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day, resulting in a total of 700 new admissions. Therefore, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds. The total number of unoccupied beds is then 1000 (total capacity) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we can break down the problem step by step.

"Given that Courtney reported 48 people at the concert and Kelly stated that this number was 20% higher than the actual number, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be written as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Given the problem, let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

The correct answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

According to the problem, Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey. Therefore, the number of corn chips Collins received is:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the total cost of travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."

3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

First, calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Given the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we can calculate the total age of the family members as follows:

- Nani is 8 years old.
- His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.
- Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:

   \]

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \[
   4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up all the times:
\[
45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is $600 each, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, let's break down the problem step by step.

- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To determine the number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of crawfish caught on each day.
2. Sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days.
3. Divide the total amount by the serving size to find the number of servings.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we have:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of remaining students after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we use the formula for the average:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]"
"Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{63} \)."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed.
2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

Let's start with the petunias:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

Next, the sweet potato vines:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

Now, the cost of the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

Next, the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Finally, the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
- Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil for planting roses is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Anastasia, with her background in financial planning, can provide a detailed analysis of Jessica's budget and spending habits.

First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we determine her annual savings for shoes:
\[ \$500.00 \text{ per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = \$6,000.00 \]

Given that each pair of shoes costs \$1,000.00, we can calculate the number of pairs she can buy in a year:
\[ \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00 \text{ per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be done sequentially, the total time required is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \boxed{45} minutes."
"The air conditioner cools the room at different rates depending on the setting. On low, it cools the room at 2 degrees per hour, and on high, it cools the room at 3 degrees per hour. The room also warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is off.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees

The net change in temperature is calculated as follows:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees
- Total warming: \(-4\) degrees

Net change in temperature: \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to account for each type of check he writes and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howl Duration:**
   - The total howl duration is the sum of the howls of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.
   - Total howl duration = \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

5. **Convert Total Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, \(120\) seconds is \(\frac{120}{60} = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."

"Given the information, we need to find Wilfred's age. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are provided with the following details:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"

"To determine the remaining capacity of the tank, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to account for the charge loss over the 8-hour period.

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the remaining charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the remaining charge is \( x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \).

3. **Final charge:**
   - After 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28% of the initial charge.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

Now, let's calculate the values:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Substituting these values into the equation:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of each fabric piece. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the dimensions of each piece are:

Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

The area of one fabric piece is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the deliveries for each day and then sum them up.

"To determine the average loss per race, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Win: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Loss: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total loss and total win:

- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total win: \(11\).

Net result:
- Net loss: \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\).

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

Thus, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert his height as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours each painter worked, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"Given the total number of books in the library is 50, we can determine the number of books written in each language as follows:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.
2. Determine how many loads of laundry are needed based on the machine's capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year.**

- Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
- Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

**Step 2: Determine the number of loads needed.**

- The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
- The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

**Step 3: Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year.**

- Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food for all three cats.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so the daily consumption for one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}

   - Total cost: \(125 + 126 = 251\)

Therefore, the total cost of the party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's first determine the original amounts of money that Maggie and Riza had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. Let \( M \) be Maggie's original amount of money. We can write the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80.

Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. Let \( R \) be Riza's original amount of money. We can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week, it eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   Therefore, in a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas per day}
   \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

Therefore, the final answer is 750 pieces."
"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 15 roses.
2. Determine the total amount of money Jenny has.
3. Calculate the change in dollars.
4. Convert the change into quarters.

First, the cost of one rose is $1.25 (since a dozen roses cost $15, and \( \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \)).

The cost of 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:
\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:
\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas:**
   - Jenny buys 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas.
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

2. **Calculate the total cost if bought individually:**
   - The cost per banana is $0.80.
   - Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost if bought in bunches:**
   - The cost per bunch is $3.00.
   - Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost for individual bananas - Total cost for bunches
   - Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, let's denote the initial amount as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls.

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area for each is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area for each is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

"The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"Anastasia:

To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first calculate the daily total:

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, totaling \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes

So, each day, Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, over 5 days, the total time spent is:

\[60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}\]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

\[300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\]

"Given that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles, and knowing that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00, reducing her balance to:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, she bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:
\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
So, the cost of the frying pan is:
\[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The discount on the set of towels is:
\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]
So, the cost of the set of towels is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total production of all five workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"Given the problem, let's define the number of eggs each person painted:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40

"To determine the cost per single bagel after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   Each pack of bagels costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   Russell receives a 10% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bagels:**
   Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per single bagel:**
   Divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels.
   \[
   \text{Cost per single bagel} = \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This simplifies to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the first ticket.
2. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
3. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

Given:
- The probability of winning for the first ticket, \( P_1 \), is 20% or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so the probability of winning for the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments across all three complexes.
3. Determine the total number of collections per week.
4. Calculate the total earnings based on the payment per collection.

First, the third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined number of the first two complexes. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined number is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has:
\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). Thus, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, summing up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( R \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we get:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Define the amount given to their little sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount each of them gave to their little sister.

3. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

5. **Determine the amount left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and half of it is yellow, we can determine that 6 pints of the paint are yellow. The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. The total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is \(12 - 6 = 6\) pints. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3:

\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To find the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Additional pods = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods.
   - Total pods in the special size box = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod runs one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is the same as the number of pods you can buy for $1.
   - Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals while Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals. Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

The total number of goals scored by Team A is \(4 + 2 = 6\), and the total number of goals scored by Team B is \(2 + 8 = 10\).

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the number of days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \(n\) days as \(C_n\). We start with \(C_0 = 2.75\) inches.

- After the first day, \(C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches.
- After the second day, \(C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches.
- After the third day, \(C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
- After the fourth day, \(C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
- After the fifth day, \(C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since \(C_5 = 0.90112\) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Determine the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is \(4 + 7 = 11\).
3. The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
4. The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since 100 books cost $500, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her 6 friends and then convert those slices into whole pizza pies.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

For 6 friends, the total number of slices is:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

The final answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the snowballs he builds and the ones that melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To reach 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals needed is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

On the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, his two-story house is 7 times his height. Therefore, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height, which is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the first floor ceiling height and the second floor height. Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor. Then:

\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for \( h \):

\[ h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles required for all four dogs based on the average:

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, let's break down the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the eggs.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the eggs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the eggs.**
Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the eggs.**
Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]
The number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]
Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"To solve the problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes

"To determine how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in that time.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week.

First, we know that Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we know that it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call. So, the number of calls he can handle each day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total number of calls he deals with in a week is:

"To determine the total number of popped kernels, let's break down the popping rates and calculate step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels} \]

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To solve the problem, we first calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we determine the net change in the number of holes each day when Nate starts filling them. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, resulting in a net change of:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at this net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

\[
\boxed{4}

   x = 29 - 24 = 5
   \]
6. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers and Igor brought 5, the number of beakers lost is:
   \[
   7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the total number of screws James has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \(\boxed{5}\)."
