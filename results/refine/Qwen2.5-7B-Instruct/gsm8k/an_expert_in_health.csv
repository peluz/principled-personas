"To determine how much Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks each day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs used for breakfast and baking muffins.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.

Given:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
- She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.

First, calculate the total number of eggs used:
\[ 3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for muffins)} = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, calculate the number of eggs remaining to be sold:
\[ 16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (used eggs)} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs at $2 per egg:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
6. Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
7. Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The sum of their current ages is 162.

Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\). The equation for their total age is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to identify the guesses from each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the total weekly hours John spends on caring for the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.

Each dog requires 0.5 hours per day for care. With 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To address the problem from a health expert's perspective, we need to clarify that the scenario provided does not directly relate to health or medical expertise. However, we can still solve the problem and provide the answer in a structured format.

John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. We need to determine how many lego sets he still has.

First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, given her speeds for running, walking, and skipping, we need to first establish her running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

Thus, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we calculate the time she spends running and walking in the six-hour period.

Total time: 6 hours
- One-third of the time running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
- Two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the initial number of pieces minus the remaining pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can consume while staying within your daily calorie target, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate the grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips contains 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips. 

**Final Answer: 48 grams**"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to consider the cost and revenue involved in the process. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**

"Given the context and the persona of an expert in health, the question about Marcy's pension does not align with the health domain expertise. However, if we interpret the question in a way that relates to health benefits or retirement planning, we can provide a refined response as follows:

If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and is entitled to a pension of $50,000 per year, starting after 20 years, she becomes eligible for an additional 5% of the pension value per year. If she quits after 30 years, her annual pension will include both the base pension and the additional 5%.

1. **Initial Annual Pension**: $50,000
2. **Additional Pension**: 5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years will be:
\[ \text{Total Annual Pension} = \$50,000 + \$2,500 = \$52,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{52500} \]"

Given that there are 200 Grade 5 students and \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them are boys, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, let's break down the information provided:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
3. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion based on the rate at which the fog bank is moving.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We need to find the time \( x \) it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

Given:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 one-hour episodes, so \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- Total hours watched: 7 hours.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine the number of elves remaining, we follow these steps:

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. This means:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. This leaves:
   \[

"To determine Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we start by calculating his expenditure for June. Given that his expenditure in May was $500 and it was $60 less in June, we can find his June expenditure as follows:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Next, we add the expenditures of both months to find the total expenditure:

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is \(\boxed{940}\)."
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred, we need to calculate the total number of rides they took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of roller coaster rides:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Total roller coaster rides = 2 (Pam) + 4 (Fred) = 6 rides.

Next, let's calculate the number of luge rides:
- Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each.
- Total luge rides = 2 (Pam) + 2 (Fred) = 4 rides.

"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we start by defining the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queens).
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

Substituting \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \), we get:
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now, substituting \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding up all the tires inflated:
\[
10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:

3. Baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\) (since each baguette is 2 feet long, and \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches)

Now, sum the lengths:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Convert the total length to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given a 20% increase every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
- \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

First, calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

"To determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"Given the context and the persona of an expert in health, the problem provided does not directly relate to health-related knowledge. However, we can still solve the problem and present the answer in a structured format.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current amount of water in the small pool given the leak rates and the relationships between the pools' water levels.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the current amount of water in the small pool (in gallons).
- \( B \) as the current amount of water in the big pool (in gallons).

Given:
- Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we express the water levels 4 minutes ago:
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

We also know:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now, we equate the two expressions for \( B \):
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons.

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we start by identifying their current ages based on the given information.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average of their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's establish their individual rates:
- Kalinda's rate: 4 pieces per minute.
- Her mom's rate: Half of Kalinda's rate, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Next, we add their rates to find the combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"Given the scenario, we need to determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To determine the number of tomato vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total tomato consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week, he consumes:
\[ 6 \, \text{tomatoes/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{tomatoes/week} \]

His girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, so she consumes:
\[ \frac{6}{2} \, \text{tomatoes/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 3 \, \text{tomatoes/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week} \]

Together, they consume:
\[ 42 \, \text{tomatoes/week} + 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week} = 63 \, \text{tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so the number of vines needed is:

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days and then convert that into calories.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Therefore, Sue's sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.
- Therefore, Sue ate a total of \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
- The difference is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows and then calculate the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

After adding the new cows, each stall now has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:

"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?

To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings:
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day}
   \]

2. Calculate Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus:
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week}
   \]

3. Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week}
   \]

4. April typically has 4 weeks, so we calculate his total earnings for the month:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for April} = \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200
   \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."

"To determine the number of players on the defense, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to account for the rewards and the coupon applied.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned:**
   - The customer spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned are:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Apply the rewards and coupon:**
   - On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.
   - They used the $4 reward.
   - The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total amount deducted from the $43 purchase is:
     \[
     4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the final amount paid:**
   - Subtract the total deductions from the shopping trip amount:
     \[
     43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A).

"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to use the given information and apply basic arithmetic.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so:
\[ H = 2C \]

Additionally, the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:

"To determine the energy savings, we need to calculate the daily energy consumption before and after the reduction in usage time.

1. **Initial Daily Energy Consumption:**
   - Power of the air conditioner: 900 watts
   - Usage time: 8 hours
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Converting to kilowatt-hours: \( 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

2. **Reduced Daily Energy Consumption:**
   - Usage time: 3 hours
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Converting to kilowatt-hours: \( 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

3. **Daily Savings:**
   - Savings: \( 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

4. **Total Savings Over 30 Days:**
   - Total savings: \( 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is \(\boxed{135}\)."
"To determine the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first calculate the total number of stripes:

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Since there are 4 zebras, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[\frac{88}{4} = 22\]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is \(\boxed{22}\)."

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of health and nutrition.

1. **Determine the initial number of corns:**
   - We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis.
   - He has 40 cannolis.
   - Therefore, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **Calculate the new number of cannolis after buying more:**
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - The new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **Determine the new number of corns after buying more:**
   - Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - The new total number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Calculate the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.

"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to consider the given probabilities and the independence of the defects.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, given the total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and humps to determine the number of dromedaries in the herd.

Let's define the variables:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

   Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   Tom traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   \[
   800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Rest Day:**
   Tom did not travel on the next day.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second Week:**
   Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we start with the initial count of 50 cats. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so the total number of cats taken by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years total 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112

"The problem involves calculating the original cost difference between two types of jeans based on sale prices and savings. Given that the tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, the sale price of the jogger jeans is $22. Cole saved a total of $6, with $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans. 

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we use the savings information:
\[ \text{Original price of jogger jeans} = \text{Sale price} + \text{Savings} = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28. Therefore, the difference in original prices is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:

"To determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)

"To determine how many insects Lily found, we can set up the problem using algebra. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

"To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the fraction of a skein each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein, and since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein, so the amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, let's follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers}
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers}
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers}
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To determine the current age difference between Jame and his cousin, we start by calculating Jame's current age. Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\) years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: \(55 - 8 = 47\).

The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa can produce together in 12 hours, given their respective production rates.

First, let's determine Ruiz's hourly production rate:
- Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
- Therefore, Ruiz's hourly production rate is:
  \[
  \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
  \]

Next, let's determine Marissa's hourly production rate:
- Marissa produces \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz does in two hours.
- Ruiz produces 120 pounds in two hours, so Marissa's hourly production rate is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production for each in 12 hours:
- Ruiz's total production in 12 hours is:
  \[
  60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in health, it is clear that the scenario provided does not align with the health domain. However, if we were to interpret the question in a health context, we might consider the financial aspect as a metaphor for resource allocation in healthcare.

Joe has $50 to allocate for an ""outfit"" for his field trip. The store is offering a 30% discount, and the items he wants to buy are a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35. Let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

1. Calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

2. The shorts will cost:
\[ 35 \]

3. The total cost before tax is:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will not be able to make the purchase.

Given the constraints and the health domain expertise, the final answer is that Joe will have:
\[ \boxed{0} \]
Joe will have no money left and will be short by $2.50."
"To determine the amount of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40\) months.
   - However, the problem states that the cost for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding per month.
   - The cost per month for the remaining 5 months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\)
   - Cost for the remaining 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\)
   - Total cost: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\)

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Initial distance between Bob and Tom: 75 miles

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is:
\[ \boxed{5 \text{ hours}} \]"
"Given the context and the persona of an expert in health, let's reframe the problem in a way that aligns with health-related knowledge and expertise. However, since the original problem does not directly relate to health, we will interpret the number of fish caught as a metaphor for health metrics or patient outcomes.

If Naomi caught 17 fish, which we can interpret as 17 patients, and Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, we can interpret this as Darren treating 11 patients (17 - 6 = 11). Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which we can interpret as Tommy treating 14 patients (11 + 3 = 14).

Therefore, the number of patients Tommy treated is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the maximum number of missed classes based on the total cost and the number of classes.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Then, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Finally, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Given the context and the persona of an expert in health, let's reframe the problem in a way that aligns with health-related expertise. We can interpret the ""customers"" processed as ""patients"" seen in a healthcare setting.

Julie, being an expert in healthcare operations, operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 patients. We need to determine the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week.

First, let's determine how many patients Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 patients daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) patients daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of patients processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) patients.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many patients they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) patients.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[
\boxed{1050}
\]"

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and legs of the animals on Lee's farm. Let's define the variables:
- \( S \) = number of sheep
- \( G \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total cost of drinks and snacks for the group, we first need to calculate the total number of people. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we start by calculating the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which is:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

The combined capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Let \( x \) represent Gary's truck capacity. Then we have:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + x = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 8800 + x = 11600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ x = 2800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked, we need to consider the dietary needs and consumption patterns of the group. Given that each female ate 3 dumplings and each male (including Larry) ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can calculate the total consumption as follows:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person consumes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:

"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we start by calculating the total number of slices. Each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert this to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) represent the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can break down the points they earn from each category and then calculate the difference.

Let's define the variables:
- \( E_e \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( E_b \) = number of berries Emma collects
- \( E_t \) = seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level

For Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To determine how many white fish Bob bought, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( O \) represent the number of orange fish Bob bought, and \( W \) represent the number of white fish Bob bought. We know the following:

1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
   \[
   O + W = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
   \[
   3 + O = 2(4 + W)
   \]

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + O = 8 + 2W
\]

Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
\[
O - 2W = 5
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
O + W = 17 \\
O - 2W = 5
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we use the elimination method. Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(O + W) - (O - 2W) = 17 - 5
\]
\[
O + W - O + 2W = 12
\]
\[
3W = 12
\]
\[
W = 4

**Step 2: Determine the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 \text{ employees} + 60 \text{ employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Compute the total salary expense for all employees over three months.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total salary expense for 260 employees for one month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the salary is paid monthly, the total salary expense for three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, let's break down the problem using the given constraints and our expertise in health and wellness.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - The amount of fragrance is the same as citrus zest, so it is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - The amount of sugar is the same as salt, so it is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   2z + 4s = 10
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
   \[
   z + 2s = 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( z \):**
   From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
   \[
   z = 5 - 2s
   \]

4. **Determine the Amount of Oil:**
   The amount of oil is \( 2s \). To find the specific value, we need to ensure that \( z \) is a positive number. If we set \( s = 1 \), then:
   \[
   z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]
   This satisfies the equation, and the amount of oil is:
   \[
   2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."

"To determine how many cards Becca has, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information.

Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.
- The total number of cards is 341.

We can write the equation for the total number of cards as:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy had is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the net loss for Milly, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount, then find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The original cost of the book is $32.
   - The refund amount is $24.
   - The shipping cost is $3.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \text{Original cost} - \text{Refund amount} + \text{Shipping cost} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3 = \$11
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and receives an additional $100 from her father, giving her a total of $140. She spends $60 on two pairs of jeans (2 * $30) and $20 on a bag. Therefore, her total expenditure is $60 + $20 = $80.

"To determine how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Anthony's savings.
2. Use Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved.

First, we know that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00. Therefore, Anthony's savings are:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we need to consider the relationship between speed, distance, and time.

First, let's establish the distance \(D\) that the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos, each traveling at speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

"Given the context and the persona of an expert in health, let's reframe the problem in a way that aligns with health-related knowledge and expertise. However, since the original problem does not directly relate to health, we will interpret the number of clay dishes as a metaphor for health-related items or activities.

Let's assume the clay dishes represent health-related activities or items that Jada, Rory, and Kora are tracking for a health project. Here's the refined response:

Kora made 20 health-related activities. Rory made 20 more health-related activities than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) health-related activities. Jada made twice as many health-related activities as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) health-related activities.

The total number of health-related activities they all made together is:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of health-related activities they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current milk production. With 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day, the total production is:

\[ 3 \, \text{cows} \times 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer aims to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to meet the daily milk production goal.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:

   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[

"To determine how much more money Gabriel needs to buy the car and phone, we first calculate the total cost of the items:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5600\).

"Given the context and the persona of an expert in health, let's reframe the problem with a focus on health-related metrics and interpretations.

Jack collected 60 dishes, which can be interpreted as health check-ups or medical tests. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 30 socks. This can be seen as a health record or a count of health-related items.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, which means Peter has 60 socks. This can be interpreted as a health-related metric, such as the number of health check-ups or the number of health-related items Peter has.

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 30 dishes. This can be interpreted as a health check-up count or a health-related metric.

To find the total number of health-related items (socks and dishes) they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of health-related items = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Given the total number of students and the breakdown of those who are good at only one subject, we can calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects.

1. Total number of students: 20
2. Students good at math only: 5
3. Students good at English only: 8

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of students good at both subjects can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Second Year**: They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. **Third Year**: They will build double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year. By the end of the second year, the total number of homes is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Adding up the homes built each year, we get:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"To determine your age, let's break down the information provided and use it to solve the problem step-by-step.

1. You are three years younger than your brother.
2. You are two years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's define the variables:
- \( B \) = age of your brother
- \( S \) = age of your sister
- \( Q \) = your age

From the information given:
1. \( Q = B - 3 \)
2. \( Q = S + 2 \)
3. Your mom's age = \( 3B - 1 \)
4. \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \)

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, your age is \(\boxed{13}\)."

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we start by calculating the number of indoor plants. Given that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"Given the information, we need to determine the speed of the whirligig based on the speeds of the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit.

1. Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second.
2. The speed of the whatchamacallit is 11 times the speed of the thingamabob, so the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11v \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11v = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
5. The speed of the whirligig is 5 times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:
   \[
   5v = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

The speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first calculate her earnings from mowing lawns. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54J \]

To find the value of \( J \), we need to ensure that the result is a non-negative amount. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since the amount cannot be negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine the total calorie content of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \]

Therefore, the total calories from the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \)

The difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car is:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine Peter's age based on the provided conditions. Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substituting the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

"To determine how many points Azibo scored, we can use the information provided and set up equations based on the relationships between the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar.

Given:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to calculate the number of measuring spoons he initially has. Given that he has 24 measuring cups and \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"Given the hospital's capacity of 1000 beds, initially 1/5 of the beds are occupied. This means 200 beds are occupied initially, leaving 800 unoccupied beds. Over 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day, resulting in a total of 700 new admissions. Therefore, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds. The total number of unoccupied beds is then 1000 (total capacity) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 beds.

**Final Answer:** 100"

"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.

According to the problem:
1. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.
3. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so the equation is:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
   \]

Simplify the equation:
\[
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
\]
\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, calculate the number of Pokemon Stan has caught:
\[
4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, and then find their sum.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, we calculate their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]"

3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

Let's break it down:

1. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and there are 5 baskets:
   \[
   \text{Total petunias} = 3 \, \text{petunias/basket} \times 5 \, \text{baskets} = 15 \, \text{petunias}
   \]

2. Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines, and there are 5 baskets:
   \[
   \text{Total sweet potato vines} = 2 \, \text{vines/basket} \times 5 \, \text{baskets} = 10 \, \text{vines}
   \]

3. The cost of each petunia is $3.00:
   \[
   \text{Cost of petunias} = 15 \, \text{petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00
   \]

4. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50:
   \[
   \text{Cost of sweet potato vines} = 10 \, \text{vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00
   \]

5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
   \[

"To determine how many roses can be planted, we need to calculate the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

The total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil for planting roses is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be done sequentially, the total time required is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \boxed{45} minutes."
"Given the scenario, we can calculate the net temperature change in the room over the specified period. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. **Orbital Period of Comet Halley:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

2. **Age of Bill's Father When He Saw the Comet:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

3. **Age of Bill When He Saw the Comet for the Second Time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

4. **Time Interval Between the Two Sightings:**
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

5. **Calculating Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check and sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
2. Calculate the number of flights to France based on the given proportions.

From the problem, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes:
\[ 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ trips} \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips} \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 / 2 = \frac{88}{8} = 11 \text{ trips} \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl:

"Given the information, we need to determine Wilfred's age. Let's summarize the details:

- Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \) years
- Alessandro's age: \( B = 4 \) years
- Total age of the children: \( A + B + H + W = 20 \) years
- Helene's age: \( H = 2 \times \text{average age of the group} \)

First, we calculate the average age of the group:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}
\]
Given that \( H = 2 \times \text{average age} \), we substitute the average age:
\[
H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}
\]

Substitute the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}
\]
\[
H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}
\]
\[
H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}
\]
\[
H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}
\]
\[
4H = 14 + 2H + 2W
\]
\[
2H = 14 + 2W
\]
\[
H = 7 + W
\]

We also know the total age of the children:
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]
\[
H + W = 13
\]

Substitute \( H = 7 + W \) into \( H + W = 13 \):
\[
7 + W + W = 13
\]
\[
7 + 2W = 13
\]
\[
2W = 6

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to account for the charge loss over time. Given that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours and then 7% each hour for the next 3 hours, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

After the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Calculating the values:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to account for the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the number of people on the train at the final stop, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"To determine the annual cost of James's insurance after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

Next, we add this increase to the normal monthly cost to get the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to consider the frequency and quantity of sheets used and the capacity of the laundry machine.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food for all the cats and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. **Daily Consumption per Cat:**
   Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so the daily consumption per cat is:
   \[
   60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

2. **Total Daily Consumption for 3 Cats:**
   Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

3. **Number of Days 720 Grams Will Last:**
   To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   \[

"To determine the time Betsy spent on her part of the meal, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( D \) represent the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To determine the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to sum up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills:

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption for each of the first two monkeys:
- The first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas in a week.
- The second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas in a week.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
\[70 + 98 = 168\]

Since the total number of bananas bought is 315, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[315 - 168 = 147\]

"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 15 roses.
2. Determine the change Jenny receives.
3. Convert the change into quarters.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, the cost of one rose is:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total production of the first four workers.
2. Determine the total production required to meet the order.
3. Find the production of the fifth worker.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total production of all five workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we start by calculating the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To determine how many stickers Seth originally had, we need to work through the problem step by step, considering the actions of each person involved.

   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis's Stickers:**
   - Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth's Stickers:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Luis originally had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Thus, the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is \(\boxed{64}\)."

"To determine the cost per single bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
4. Calculate the cost per single bagel.

Let's go through each step:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Applying a 10% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the total cost after the discount is:

   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels. Therefore, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per single bagel is:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the cost per single bagel is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This simplifies to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:

"To determine the number of women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight, we first need to find the initial number of men and women based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 84 \]

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). Therefore, we have:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]
\[ 14x = 84 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Next, we account for the 20 women who alight from the bus at the next stop. The number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To determine Abraham's total earnings from selling his land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **First Sale:**
   - Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
   - Therefore, the price per square meter for the first sale is \( \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \) dollars per square meter.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, Abraham has 40 square meters left.
   - He sold a quarter of the remaining 40 square meters for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is 10 square meters.
   - Therefore, the price per square meter for the second sale is \( \frac{30}{10} = 3 \) dollars per square meter.

3. **Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, Abraham has 30 square meters left.
   - He sold these 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**

"To determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we start by calculating the total number of eggs Cole hid. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs found by each person:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, we sum the total number of eggs found:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments across all three complexes.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment per collection.

First, the third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined number of the first two complexes. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined number is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has:
\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his total earnings per week are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to follow the given production pattern:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the red rope given the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes and their total combined length.

Let's define the lengths of the ropes:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28, \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

     \]
   - Simplifying the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in health and the constraints provided.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to calculate the remaining chalk after each day, given that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: 5 inches.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Chalk after Monday} = 5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Daily Usage**: 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday)**:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Chalk} = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 2 (Wednesday)**:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Chalk} = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 3 (Thursday)**:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Chalk} = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 4 (Friday)**:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Chalk} = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 5 (Saturday)**:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Chalk} = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
  \]

Since the remaining chalk after 5 days is 0.90112 inches, which is less than 2 inches, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk on the 6th day.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before recycling the chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity.

"To determine Colin's current age, we can use the information provided and set up a system of equations based on the given conditions.

Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age and \( W \) represent Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify:
- Wendy's current age is \( W = 5(20) + 35 = 135 \).
- In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old.
- A third of Wendy's current age is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \).

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27,000. Since each set of 100 books costs $500, the number of sets he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to consider the total number of slices her friends will consume and the number of slices each pizza provides.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, considering his rate of building and melting snowballs, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which translates to 5 snowballs every 15 minutes.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \(5 - 2 = 3\) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \(20 \times 15 = 300\) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

The miles needed for the first three dogs are:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Thus, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

"To determine the initial number of grapes, we need to account for the grapes consumed and used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. Her mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes, totaling \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

Let \(G\) represent the initial number of grapes. The equation to find \(G\) is:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = 48 \]

Solving for \(G\):

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]
\[ G = 48 + 36 \]
\[ G = 84 \]

"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by noting the given information:

- The tower consists of 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which means there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[12 + R = 32\]

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we need to break down the transaction into two parts based on the given prices.

1. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.
2. He will sell half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each.

First, calculate the number of toy soldiers in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, calculate the earnings from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, add the earnings from both parts to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, the total amount Matthew would earn is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net change in the number of holes each day and then calculate the total time required to fill all the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine the net change in the number of holes each day when Nate is home. Each day, Nate fills 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new holes, so the net change in the number of holes each day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we start by calculating the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

Next, we find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To determine the number of beakers Igor lost, let's break down the information provided:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \( x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 24 + x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the number of screws left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the total number of screws James has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, each table needs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Given that there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and the second basket contains twice as many eggs, the second basket has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs.

"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls for the carnival, we can follow these steps:

1. **Alexandra's Contribution**: Alexandra raises $430.
2. **Kim's Contribution**: Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. **Sarah's Contribution**: Sarah raises $300.
4. **Maryam's Contribution**: Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we sum up the contributions:

\[
\text{Total} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To determine how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race, we need to consider the given information and apply basic principles of speed, distance, and time.

1. **Distance and Speed Relationship:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Vanessa's Speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

3. **Time Calculation for Vanessa:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took \(\boxed{64}\) minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

Given that the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given a profit of 25%. The selling price per watermelon is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

1. **Ana's Pacing:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Jane's Pacing:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Difference in Oranges Peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of animals and their legs to determine the number of chickens.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We know:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \(\boxed{5}\)."
