"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, we subtract the eggs she uses from the total eggs laid:
16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, the money she makes is:
9 × $2 = $18.

The answer is: $18."
"A robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so it needs 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, in total, it needs:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The total bolts needed: 3"
"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. The house's value went up by 150%. 

To find out how much the house is worth now, we need to add the increase in value to the original price. 

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Josh spent in total:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The correct answer is: \boxed{70000}"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
2. Wendi has 20 chickens.
3. So, the total feed needed for all chickens is:
   \[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

4. In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
5. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.
6. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
   \[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

7. To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed already given from the total feed needed:
   \[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. One glass costs $5.
2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Now, we add up all the sheep.
   - Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
   - Total sheep = \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\)

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"Carla is downloading a big file that is 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute. 

First, she downloads 40% of the file:
- 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.
- It takes her 40 minutes to download 80 GB (because 80 ÷ 2 = 40).

Then, Windows needs to update, which takes 20 minutes.

After the update, she has to start downloading the file from the beginning again. So, she needs to download the remaining 120 GB (200 - 80 = 120):
- It takes her 60 minutes to download 120 GB (because 120 ÷ 2 = 60).

So, the total time is:
- 40 minutes (first part) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (second part) = 120 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. That means he travels 180 miles (60 miles/hour × 3 hours).

On his way back, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't travel any distance during that time. Then he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 miles per hour, which means he travels 15 miles (30 miles/hour × 0.5 hours). After that, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour, which means he travels 120 miles (80 miles/hour × 1.5 hours).

So, the total distance he travels on his way back is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

He was 180 miles away from home when he started his return trip. After traveling 135 miles, he is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles away from home.

The answer is: 45 miles."
"Eliza works 40 hours at $10 per hour, so she earns:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the extra 5 hours she worked, she gets paid more. Her extra pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, so:
1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour for overtime

For the 5 overtime hours, she earns:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

So, her total earnings for the week are:
$400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

The answer is $460."
"In the first month, the program got 60 downloads.

In the second month, it got three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, it got 30% less than the second month. So, it got 70% of 180:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total downloads over the three months, we add them up:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, let's add all these up:
- Donuts: $204
- Mini cupcakes: $160
- Mini cheesecakes: $330

So, the total cost is \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

The total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, it grows 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money.

First, let's see how much money Carlos makes each year from selling lemons:
7 lemons × $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 each year.

Now, let's see how much it costs to water and feed the tree each year:
$3 each year.

So, the money Carlos makes after paying for water and food each year is:
$10.5 - $3 = $7.5 each year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the $90 he spent on planting the tree. We do this by dividing the cost of the tree by the money he makes each year:
$90 ÷ $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from the lemon tree.

The answer is: \boxed{12}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house. So, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) at the orange house. After that, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
Add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 2x = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know there are 20 students in the class.
2. 20% of these students are in contemporary dance. So, we calculate 20% of 20:
   \[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \text{ students} \]
3. Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.
4. 25% of these 16 students are in jazz dance. So, we calculate 25% of 16:
   \[ 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \text{ students} \]
5. Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left for hip-hop dance.
6. To find the percentage of students in hip-hop dance, we use:
   \[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the answer is \(\boxed{60\%}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in a primary school. We have two choices: buying jewelry that costs $5,000 or buying electronic gadgets that cost $8,000. 

Now, a smart person told us that the jewelry might go up a little bit, by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets might go up a little bit, by 1.2%.

Let's see how much they might be worth at the end of the month:

1. **Jewelry:**
   - It starts at $5,000.
   - It goes up by 2.5%, which means it becomes \(5000 \times 1.025 = 5125\).

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - It starts at $8,000.
   - It goes up by 1.2%, which means it becomes \(8000 \times 1.012 = 8096\).

Now, let's see how much profit we make from each:

1. **Jewelry Profit:**
   - We start with $5,000 and end with $5,125.
   - So, the profit is \(5125 - 5000 = 125\).

2. **Electronic Gadgets Profit:**
   - We start with $8,000 and end with $8,096.
   - So, the profit is \(8096 - 8000 = 96\).

So, if we want to make the most money, we should buy the electronic gadgets. The profit from the electronic gadgets is $96.

**Final Answer:**
The profit from buying electronic gadgets is $96."
"Each train travels 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. To find out how far each train travels in total, we add these distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

**Answer: A**"
"Jill works 50 weeks a year. She teaches 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly teaching earnings are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700 \]
For a year, her teaching earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ weeks} \times \$700/\text{week} = \$35,000 \]

She also coaches 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly coaching earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450 \]
For a year, her coaching earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ weeks} \times \$450/\text{week} = \$22,500 \]

Adding both earnings together, her total annual salary is:
\[ \$35,000 + \$22,500 = \$57,500 \]

So, Jill's annual salary is \(\$57,500\)."
"Claire makes 3 egg omelets every day. In one week, she makes:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

In 4 weeks, she makes:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the answer is 7 dozens."
"Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

First, let's find out how long it should take her to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

She has already spent 2 hours hiking, so she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to hike is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. You have 10 liters of orange drink, and it is two-thirds water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. You spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so you have 9 liters left. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. You have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it is three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. Now, you mix the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the mixture is:

"Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31 years old, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now:
- Samantha is 31 years old.
- Raymond is 6 years younger than Samantha.
So, Raymond is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. So, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to 8 customers on Tuesday. Let's count how many DVDs he sold:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this together. Kyle bought a book for $19.50, and that price was after a 25% discount. This means the $19.50 is 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% would be. If $19.50 is 75%, then we can find 1% by dividing $19.50 by 75. 

\[ 1\% = \frac{19.50}{75} = 0.26 \]

Now, to find 100%, we multiply 0.26 by 100:

\[ 100\% = 0.26 \times 100 = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26. 

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{26}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Marie bought a chicken meal for $12.
2. She bought 5 packs of milk at $3 each, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. She bought 4 apples at $1.50 each, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Mishka spent on the shorts. Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, and each pair costs $16.50. So, we multiply 3 by $16.50:
\[ 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \]
So, Mishka spent $49.50 on shorts.

Next, we find out how much Mishka spent on the pants. Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $22.50. So, we multiply 3 by $22.50:
\[ 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \]
So, Mishka spent $67.50 on pants.

Then, we find out how much Mishka spent on the shoes. Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $42. So, we multiply 3 by $42:
\[ 3 \times 42 = 126 \]
So, Mishka spent $126 on shoes.

Now, we add up all the money Mishka spent:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

The final answer is \(\boxed{243}\)."
"Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. In 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00. So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cynthia will spend:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Henry's bike trip is 60 miles long. He stopped first after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to figure out how far he was from the end when he made his second stop. Since the trip is 60 miles and he stopped 15 miles before the end, he was:

\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means he had 45 miles left to go when he made his second stop. Since he had already traveled 20 miles to his first stop, the distance between his first and second stops is:

\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. One pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.
4. The problem says that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. So, if we add $5 to the total cost of the high heels, we get the cost of the boots.
5. Therefore, the cost of the boots is \(99 + 5 = 104\) dollars.

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years.
2. Their total age now is 162 years.

Let's find out how many years each part of the ratio represents. We add the parts of the ratio together: 7 + 11 = 18.

Now, we know that 18 parts of the ratio equal 162 years. So, each part of the ratio is:
\[ \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

This means:
- Darrell's age is \(7 \times 9 = 63\) years.
- Allen's age is \(11 \times 9 = 99\) years.

Now, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. We just add 10 years to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says there are 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend says there are 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. We add them up and then divide by 3:

\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."

1. John has 10 dogs.
2. Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
3. To find out how many hours John spends each day, we multiply the number of dogs by the hours each dog needs:
   \[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]
4. Now, we need to find out how many hours John spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

The answer is: \boxed{35}"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total.
2. She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins would be \( S + 30 \).

So, the total number of coins is:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Now, the number of gold coins is:
\[ S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The answer is: \(\boxed{70}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, half of Raymond's jewels is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Aaron has 5 more than 20, so:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23

So, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.

To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we need to add 25% of 4 points to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. He needs to buy enough yogurts for 30 days. So, he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts he needs:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

The answer is: \boxed{75}"
"John sold his lego sets and used the money to buy video games. He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each. So, the total money he got is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, which cost:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he had $5 left. So, the money he spent plus the $5 left should equal the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the money from the lego sets he didn't sell. Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day.

Let's find out how fast he runs.

1. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. Let's say he runs at a speed of \( v \) miles per hour. So, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The total distance he runs in a week is:
   \[
   3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. We know he runs 60 miles a week, so:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Skipping Speed**: Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
2. **Running Speed**: Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
   \[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]
3. **Walking Speed**: Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
   \[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's find out how much time she spends running and walking:
4. **Time Running**: One-third of 6 hours is:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
5. **Time Walking**: Two-thirds of 6 hours is:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers:
6. **Distance Running**: At 6 mph for 2 hours:
   \[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
7. **Distance Walking**: At 1.5 mph for 4 hours:
   \[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances:
8. **Total Distance**: 
   \[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. So, Ben's iPhone is:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. But when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The answer is: \(\boxed{200}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pieces of pie Grandma Jones made. She baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, we multiply 5 by 8:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
This means there were 40 pieces of pie at the beginning.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie left. To find out how many pieces the guests ate, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:
\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To figure this out, let's break it down into simple steps:

1. **Find out how many calories are in one gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 1250 calories (5 servings * 250 calories per serving).
   - So, 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories per gram.

2. **Find out how many calories you can still eat:**
   - Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories.
   - So, 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories left.

3. **Find out how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - If 1 gram has 4.17 calories, then with 200 calories, you can eat:
   - 200 calories / 4.17 calories per gram ≈ 48 grams.

So, you can eat about 48 grams of chips. The answer is 48 grams."
"Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. He can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00. He sells each candle for $2.00.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of beeswax he needs to make 20 candles:
- 10 candles need 1 pound of beeswax.
- So, 20 candles need 2 pounds of beeswax.

Next, we calculate the cost of the beeswax and wicks:
- 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks cost 2 × $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, we calculate the money he gets from selling 20 candles:
- He sells each candle for $2.00.
- So, 20 candles give him 20 × $2.00 = $40.00.

Finally, we find out his net profit:
- Net profit = money from selling candles - cost of beeswax and wicks.
- Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

So, Charlie's net profit is $20.00."
"Meredith is a writer who writes about health topics. She writes 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, she writes \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she writes twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

Total articles = \(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\) articles.

Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, the total time spent writing is:
\[26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}\]

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. She had 23 Post-it notes left after all that.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she bought, we need to figure out how many she had before she used them at work.

First, let's see how many she had before using them at work:
\[ 80 + \text{(number of notes in the package)} - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for the number of notes in the package:
\[ 80 + \text{(number of notes in the package)} - 220 = 23 \]
\[ 80 + \text{(number of notes in the package)} = 23 + 220 \]
\[ 80 + \text{(number of notes in the package)} = 243 \]
\[ \text{(number of notes in the package)} = 243 - 80 \]
\[ \text{(number of notes in the package)} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The blue ties cost $40 each, and he spent $200 on them. So, the number of blue ties he bought is:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost:

\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars each}
\]

So, the total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the cost of the blue ties and the red ties, the total amount spent is:

\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"Sure, let's solve this together!

First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we can find out how many inches are in 4 feet by multiplying:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches. We do this by dividing 48 inches by 6 inches per piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many units are in the whole building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply 15 by 8:
   \[
   15 \times 8 = 120
   \]
   So, there are 120 units in total.

2. Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we multiply 120 by 3/4:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
   \]
   So, 90 units are occupied.

3. Now, to find out how many units are unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 unoccupied units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Lloyd has chickens that make 252 eggs every day. He sells these eggs for $2 per dozen. 

First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he has each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 252 by 12:
\[ \frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money he makes each day. Since he sells each dozen for $2, we multiply 21 by 2:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money he makes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 42 by 7:
\[ 42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"Tom's ship goes 10 miles every hour. He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. So, the distance he travels is:

10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, he travels back at 6 miles every hour. To find out how long it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour, we use:

Time = Distance ÷ Speed
Time = 30 miles ÷ 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. So, the weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, he needs to remove the rest of the weight, which is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

His toys weigh 1/2 pound each. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. For each truck tire, the mechanic charges $60, and for each car tire, the mechanic charges $40.

For the truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

For the car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160 \]

So, the total money made on Thursday is:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40.

For the car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480 \]

So, the total money made on Friday is:
\[ \$480 \]

To find out how much more money was made on Thursday compared to Friday:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

So, the mechanic made \$40 more on Thursday. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The bridge can carry up to 5000 pounds.
2. The truck and the driver together weigh 3755 pounds.
3. So, the truck can carry an extra 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
5. To find out how many boxes we can put on the truck, we divide the extra weight by the weight of one box: 1245 ÷ 15 = 83.

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The answer is: \(\boxed{83}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stephen's initial bill is $40.00.
2. They added a 25% fee on the $40.00. To find 25% of $40.00, we can do:
   \[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]
3. Now, add the 25% fee to the initial bill:
   \[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]
4. They also charged $3.00 for delivery:
   \[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]
5. Stephen added a $4.00 tip:

"Janet buys a brooch. She spends $500 on materials and $800 to get it made. Then she pays 10% of that total to get it insured.

First, we add the cost of materials and the cost to get it made:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we find 10% of $1300 to get the insurance cost:
\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of materials and making the brooch:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, Janet paid a total of $1430.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{1430}\)"
"Marcy works for a company for 40 years. For the first 20 years, she gets $50,000 each year. After 20 years, she gets an extra 5% of $50,000 each year. 

To find out the extra money, we do:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, she gets an extra $2,500 each year. 

Now, we add the extra money to her regular pension:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $52,500.

**Answer: $52,500**"
"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way!

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half.
   - Each month, Aleena pays $140.
   - So, for 6 months, she pays \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half too.
   - The company gives a 10% discount, so she pays less.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the new price is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars per month.
   - For 6 months, she pays \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Add the amounts from both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank of gas, we need to know how many miles she can go with one gallon of gas first. 

Sophia drove 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. So, we divide the miles by the gallons to find out how many miles she can drive with one gallon:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know her car can go 25 miles with one gallon of gas. Her tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. So, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank:

\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas.

The correct answer is: 300 miles."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we know there are 175 diamonds.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds. So, we do:
   \[ 175 - 35 = 140 \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we do:
   \[ 140 \times 2 = 280 \]
   So, there are 280 emeralds.
4. Now, we add all the gems together:
   \[ 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

"Artie sells flowers at the Farmers Market. He sells marigolds for $2.74, petunias for $1.87, and begonias for $2.12. He rounds all prices to the nearest dollar. So, marigolds are $3, petunias are $2, and begonias are $2.

Now, let's see how much he makes from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots × $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots × $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots × $2 = $34

Now, let's add up all the money:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

So, Artie will make $88."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The top level (Level 1) has 16 square feet.
2. The next level (Level 2) will have half of 16, which is 8 square feet.
3. The next level (Level 3) will have half of 8, which is 4 square feet.
4. The bottom level (Level 4) will have half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the square feet:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet

To find the average, we divide the total square feet by the number of levels:
30 ÷ 4 = 7.5 square feet

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5.

The answer is: \boxed{7.5}"
"Cecilia's puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. That means for 180 days, the puppy will need 180 cups of dog food.

One bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia needs, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups in one bag:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 1.636 \text{ bags} \]

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she needs to round up to the next whole number. So, she needs 2 bags of dog food for the first year.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{2}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, David does:
   \[
   \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, Raymond does:
   \[
   \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.00. He wants to buy 18 flowers.

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- He needs 6 packages (because 18 ÷ 3 = 6).
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost 6 × $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- He needs 9 packages (because 18 ÷ 2 = 9).
- Each package costs $1.00, so 9 packages cost 9 × $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, let's find out how much money he saves:
- The cost with packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost with packages of 2 is $9.00.
- The savings is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The answer is: \boxed{6.00}"
"John takes his dog to the groomer, and it costs $100. The groomer gives him a 30% discount because he is a new customer. 

First, we need to find out how much the discount is:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters, we do:
   \[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]
   So, each girl got 4 liters.

2. Since there are two girls, we add the water they got:
   \[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. Now, a boy got 6 liters of water. So, we add the water the boy got to the water the girls got:
   \[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

4. We started with 24 liters of water. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total water taken by the girls and the boy from 24:
   \[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water left is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Charlie started with 10 stickers. Then he got more stickers:
- He bought 21 stickers from a store.
- He got 23 stickers for his birthday.

So, let's add them up:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers.

Next, Charlie gave away some stickers:
- He gave 9 stickers to his sister.
- He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

Now, let's subtract the stickers he gave away:
54 (total stickers) - 9 (given to sister) - 28 (used for card) = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{17}\)"
"Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

First, we find out how much 4 times Grace's weight is:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, we subtract 2 pounds to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights to find their combined weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds.

The correct answer is: 623."

"Okay, let's solve this together!

The football team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. We need to find out how many games they won.

Let's say the team lost \( L \) games. Then they won \( L + 8 \) games.

The total number of games is the sum of the games they won and lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Now, let's solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Gene goes on 4 vacations each year and has been doing this since he was 23. He is now 34. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Each year, he makes 4 quilt blocks. So, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years × 4 blocks/year = 44 blocks.

The answer is 44."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The first alarm rang 4 times.
2. The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first one, so it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third alarm rang for half as long as the second one, so it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add them up:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Sylvie has been working for 5 years and her salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10%. So, her new monthly salary is:
\[ 600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, she works for 3 more years, and her salary increases by 10% each year. Let's calculate her salary for each of these 3 years:

1. **6th Year:**
   \[ 660 \times 1.10 = 726 \text{ dollars/month} \]
   Annual salary for the 6th year:
   \[ 726 \times 12 = 8712 \text{ dollars/year} \]

2. **7th Year:**

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. We know that Marilyn sold 10 times as many records as Harald.
2. If Harald sold \( H \) records, then Marilyn sold \( 10H \) records.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 records.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find out how many records Harald sold, we divide 88,000 by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) records."
"Christina is having a party and she invited 16 friends. But she knows that not everyone will come. She thinks that 3 out of every 4 friends will come to the party. So, we need to find out how many friends will come.

To do this, we multiply 16 by 3/4:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

So, 12 friends will come to the party. Now, Christina wants to give each friend 0.75 gift bags. To find out how many gift bags she needs, we multiply 12 by 0.75:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so to find out how much she will spend, we multiply 9 by $2:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Ted the T-Rex needs to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. There will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic.

First, let's find out how much potato salad the adults will eat:
- Each adult eats 10 pounds.
- There are 20 adults.
- So, the total for adults is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) pounds.

Next, let's find out how much potato salad the children will eat:
- Each child eats half of what an adult eats, so each child eats \(10 \div 2 = 5\) pounds.
- There are 5 children.
- So, the total for children is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:
- Total for adults: 200 pounds.
- Total for children: 25 pounds.
- So, the total amount of potato salad needed is \(200 + 25 = 225\) pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cindy's pets: 4
- Marcia's pets: 6
- Jan's pets: 18

So, the total number of pets is \(4 + 6 + 18 = 28\).

The total number of pets the three have is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know James is 10 years old and he is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
2. Lee's current time is 38 seconds.
3. So, Gerald's original time was 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.
4. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he can now run 90% of his original time.
5. To find 90% of 40 seconds, we do: \(40 \times 0.90 = 36\) seconds.

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   - We know there are 60 dogs.

2. **Number of Cats:**
   - For every dog, there are 2 cats. So, if there are 60 dogs, then there are \(60 \times 2 = 120\) cats.

3. **Total Number of Dogs and Cats:**
   - Adding the number of dogs and cats together, we get \(60 + 120 = 180\).

4. **Number of Rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

5. **Total Number of Pets:**
   - To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many boys there are. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 200 students are boys. So, we do:

   So, there are 80 boys.

2. Now, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since the rest of the students are girls, we do:
   \[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]
   So, there are 120 girls.

3. Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we do:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]
   So, 80 girls are in the girl scout.

4. Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
   \[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 2/3 of that. To find out how much James slept, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces.
2. When Freda makes sauce, the volume of tomatoes is halved. So, 16 ounces of tomatoes make 8 ounces of sauce.
3. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. To find out how many cans she used, we divide 32 by 8:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]
4. Each can has 3 tomatoes. So, to find out how many tomatoes she used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes. But we know that 5 cars didn't drive through the jam, so the number of cars that drove through is 30 (original cars) minus 5 (cars that took an exit).

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

But we need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. We know that 20 cars drove through in the next 15 minutes, so the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary got 18 new potted plants from the nursery. She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, she had:

potted plants before.

She is giving 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. So, she will give away:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]
potted plants.

After giving away 40 potted plants, she will have:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]
potted plants left.

Then, she gets 18 more potted plants from the nursery. So, she will have:

   - 7 pages from his History textbook
   - 8 pages from his Geography textbook

2. So, the total number of pages is:
   4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

3. Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages left to read is:
   39 - 15 = 24 pages

4. Solo has 4 more days to read these pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
   24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

"To find out how long it will take for the fog to cover the whole city, we need to know how long it takes to cover 1 mile and then multiply that by the total miles.

We know it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. So, to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we divide 10 minutes by 3:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Now, the city is 42 miles across. So, we multiply the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:

\[
\frac{10}{3} \times 42 = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the inner dimensions of one box. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

For the length:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches} \]

For the width:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches} \]

For the height:
\[ 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the volume of one box using the inner dimensions:
\[ 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework. Here's what he watched each day:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each day. So, that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours (2 one-hour shows).

Now, let's add up what we know:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

So, 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time he watched on Wednesday is:
7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Each 30-minute show is 0.5 hours. So, to find out how many 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday, we divide 1.5 by 0.5:
1.5 ÷ 0.5 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Henry is making cookies for a baking competition. He wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. But he ended up making 15 more cookies than he planned. After that, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he has 110 cookies.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. If Henry has 110 cookies now, and he dropped 5, then before dropping the cookies, he had \(110 + 5 = 115\) cookies.
2. He made 15 more cookies than he planned, so before making those extra 15, he had \(115 - 15 = 100\) cookies.
3. He wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so last year he made \(100 \div 2 = 50\) cookies.

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"Okay, let's do this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. The price is $3.00 per gallon.
   - So, for 10 gallons, it will be \(10 \times 3 = \$30.00\).

2. Next, we need to find out how much cashback we get. The app gives $0.20 cashback per gallon.
   - For 10 gallons, the cashback will be \(10 \times 0.20 = \$2.00\).

3. Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out the final cost.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, we multiply the width by the length:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
So, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, we multiply the width by the length:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]
So, Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups that Beatrice and Marcell ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]
So, together they ate 90 fruit roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]
So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{45}\)."

2. Next, we need to find out how much water the boat takes on. We know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, we can calculate the water intake as follows:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 8
   \]
   This means the boat takes on 2 liters of water eight times. So, the total water intake is:
   \[
   8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

The correct answer is: \boxed{16}"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons a day.
2. There are 4 teachers.
3. So, the total number of lessons in a day is \(4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons}\).

Now, for each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times.

4. So, the total number of cleanings in a day is \(8 \text{ lessons} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings}\).

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The answer is: \(\boxed{24}\)"
"Ryan plants 2 flowers each day. Over 15 days, he plants \(2 \times 15 = 30\) flowers. But 5 of them didn't grow, so the number of flowers that did grow is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - So, if Brittany's phone can hold \( B \) photographs, then \( 6B = 1800 \).
   - To find \( B \), we divide 1800 by 6: \( B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \).

3. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - If the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \( D \), then \( 50D = 300 \).
   - To find \( D \), we divide 300 by 50: \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sasha bought some lumber and now the prices have gone up. She has 10 boards that are 2x4x10 and 5 boards that are 4x4x10. 

She bought the 2x4x10 boards for $10 each, so for 10 boards, she paid:
10 boards * $10/board = $100

She bought the 4x4x10 boards for $16 each, so for 5 boards, she paid:
5 boards * $16/board = $80

So, the total cost for all the boards is:
$100 + $80 = $180

Now, the prices have gone up by 50%. So, the new price for the 2x4x10 boards is:
$10 * 1.5 = $15 per board
For 10 boards, she can sell them for:
10 boards * $15/board = $150

The new price for the 4x4x10 boards is:
$16 * 1.5 = $24 per board
For 5 boards, she can sell them for:
5 boards * $24/board = $120

So, the total selling price for all the boards is:
$150 + $120 = $270

To find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
$270 - $180 = $90

So, the profit Sasha makes is $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in a special way. For every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. This means the total parts she uses is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If she used 120 parts in total, we can find out how many parts each is by dividing 120 by 20. So, 120 ÷ 20 = 6.

Since she uses 7 parts of sugar, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used. So, 7 × 6 = 42.

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42.

The answer is: 42"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Each pair of shoes costs $60. To find out how much he paid, we need to do some simple math.

First, we find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total:

Next, we calculate the total cost:
6 pairs × $60/pair = $360

So, John paid $360.

The correct answer is: $360."
"On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each container. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day was \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary is \( L \), then:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than what he was making four years ago:
   \[
   40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
   \]

4. Lylah's salary four years later is also 40% more than what she was making four years ago:
   \[
   30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92
   \]

5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92

Adding them together:
\[13 + 14 = 27\]

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   She slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   For two days, the total sleep is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ hours}

"Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, in 3 hours, she runs:
10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

After that, she runs 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. So, in 4 hours, she runs:
5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles.

To find the total distance she runs in 7 hours, we add the two distances:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters. One-third of 60 is 20. So, she put stamps on 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before she added the 20 letters, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile.

So, the answer is 10."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
3. She used 3 spoons to taste the stew.
4. After all that, she had 12 spoons left.

So, if we take away the 3 spoons she used and the 5 spoons her husband gave her, we can find out how many spoons were in the package she bought.

Let's do the math:
- She had 12 spoons left.
- She used 3 spoons, so before using them, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.
- Her husband gave her 5 spoons, so before he gave them, she had 15 - 5 = 10 spoons.

So, the package Julia bought had 10 spoons.

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"

"Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times. Then, each of them rode the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

First, let's count the roller coaster rides:
- Pam: 2 rides
- Fred: 4 rides
- Total roller coaster rides: 2 + 4 = 6 rides

Next, let's count the luge rides:
- Pam: 2 rides
- Fred: 2 rides
- Total luge rides: 2 + 2 = 4 rides

Now, let's find the total number of rides:
- Total rides: 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (luge) = 10 rides

"Okay, let's solve this together!

We have 20 cars in total. Out of these:
- 12 are automatic cars
- 4 are manual cars

To find out how many are semi-automatic, we need to subtract the automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some simple numbers to understand this better:
- Let's say there are \( Q \) queens.
- Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are \( 2Q \) baby bees.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \) worker bees.

Now, we add all the bees together:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens.
- Baby bees: \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- Worker bees: \( 4 \times 100 = 400 \)

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

1. John buys milk for $2.
2. He buys eggs for $3.
3. He buys light bulbs for $3.
4. He buys cups for $3.
5. He buys roach traps for $4.

First, we add up the cost of the non-food items (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps):
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to add a 10% tax to the non-food items. To find 10% of $10:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items together:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.
2. There are 100 pineapples in each hectare.
3. So, in one hectare, there are 100 pineapples.
4. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples in one harvest is:
   \[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

5. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.
6. In one year, there are 12 months, so the number of harvests in a year is:
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

7. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, we add them all together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces. The correct answer is:

2. Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if Dorothy has \(D\) friends, then \(3D = 12\).
3. To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide 12 by 3:
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 friends.
4. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if Dorothy has 4 friends, then James has:
   \[
   4 \times 4 = 16
   \]
   friends.

So, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{16}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to know how far each person lives from school in feet:
- Steve lives 3 miles away. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Steve lives \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet away.
- Tim lives 2 miles away, so he lives \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet away.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes each of them to get home:
- Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute. So, the time it takes Steve to get home is \(15840 \div 440 = 36\) minutes.
- Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. So, the time it takes Tim to get home is \(10560 \div 264 = 40\) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim):
- The difference in time is \(40 - 36 = 4\) minutes.

So, the winner will wait for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Shawnda is helping the neighborhood kids with their bike tires. She charges 25 cents for each tire.

- For the bicycles: 5 people came, and each bicycle has 2 tires. So, \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For the tricycles: 3 people came, and each tricycle has 3 tires. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For the unicycle: 1 person came, and a unicycle has 1 tire. So, \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To find out how many dollars that is, we divide by 100:
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

So, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, he gets:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is:
\[ 60 \times 0.10 = \$6.00 \]

If Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants took the last fry, leaving 5 fries.

Now, let's go backwards:

- After the ants took the last fry, there were 5 fries left. So, before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon took two-thirds, there were 6 fries. This means \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the fries were left, so the total before the raccoon was \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's look at how many hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's look at how many hours he spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add these together to find out how many hours he spends in classes in one week:
- \(9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\).

Finally, let's find out how many hours he spends in classes in one semester, which is 16 weeks long:
- \(17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\).

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how long all the rolls are together. Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, we multiply:
   \[300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\]

2. Next, we find out how long all the chocolate croissants are together. Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, we multiply:
   \[120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\]

3. Then, we find out how long all the baguettes are together. Each baguette is 2 feet long, and Bill bakes 60 baguettes. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is 24 inches long. So, we multiply:
   \[60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\]

4. Now, we add up all the lengths in inches:
   \[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

5. Finally, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we divide:
   \[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to add up the bananas needed by each type of ape for 2 months.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas each month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas each month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas each month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up all the bananas needed for 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

So, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. So, he runs:
\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 40 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to see who runs more and by how much. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final answer is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Raphael bought some things for school. He got 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, and a rim of bond paper that cost $20.

First, let's find out how much the pens cost:
4 pens × $1.5 per pen = $6

Next, let's find out how much the notebooks cost:
2 notebooks × $4 per notebook = $8

The bond paper cost is:
$20

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 in total.

The answer is: \boxed{34}"

The number of tadpoles Finn can see now is:
15"
"On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, it has 7 feet more, so it's:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The correct answer is: 16 feet."
"Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

That's:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

So, the total number of fish they caught is:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

The answer is: \(\boxed{32}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months.
3. We need to find the price after 36 months.

First, let's see how many times the price increases in 36 months:
- 36 months ÷ 2 months = 18 times

Now, each time the price increases by 20%, it means the new price is 120% of the old price. We can write 120% as 1.20.

So, the price after 18 increases can be calculated as:
- Original price × (1.20)^18

Using a calculator:
- (1.20)^18 ≈ 39.366

Now, multiply the original price by this number:
- $20 × 39.366 ≈ $787.32

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32.

The correct answer is: \boxed{787.32}"
"Okay, let's solve this together!

We have:
- 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
- 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
- A doll that costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's find out how much the red cars cost in total:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 = \$20 \]

Next, let's find out how much the action figures cost in total:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Finally, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

So, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose money because she won't be able to work for 3 hours. She loses $35 for each hour of work. So, she will lose \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.

So, by hiring the accountant, she will save \(105 - 90 = 15\) dollars.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her computer and accessories. She bought a computer for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up the costs:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these together:

1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423

The total cost of the items is €1423. Elvira's budget is €1500, so we subtract the total cost from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The correct answer is: €77."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 45 eggs. Each time she babysits, she gets 9 eggs. So, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, Seth is \( 2B \) years old.
2. In 2 years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old, and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old.
3. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation:
   \[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
   \[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
5. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[ 3B = 24 \]
6. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ B = 8 \]
7. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is:
   \[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{16}\)"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. Ethel has $8.

First, we find twice the money Ethel has:

3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

So, the total age is \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\) years.

"Jessica needs to pay some money each month for her debts. Here's how much she needs to pay each month:

- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

To find the total, we add these amounts together:

$300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this. So, we need to find 50% of $1000 and add it to $1000:

50% of $1000 = $500

So, the total she needs to pay each month is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year.

The correct answer is: $18000."
"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes for a big family event. He has 60 potatoes to prepare. It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut it up.

First, let's find out how long it takes to peel all the potatoes:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Total number of potatoes: 60
- Total time for peeling: \(1.5 \, \text{minutes} \times 60 = 90 \, \text{minutes}\)

Next, let's find out how long it takes to cut all the potatoes:
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
- Total number of potatoes: 60
- Total time for cutting: \(5 \, \text{seconds} \times 60 = 300 \, \text{seconds}\)
- Convert seconds to minutes: \(300 \, \text{seconds} \div 60 = 5 \, \text{minutes}\)

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Making Lemonade:**
   - Lemons cost $3 per gallon.
   - Sugar costs $2 per gallon.
   - So, the total cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. **Selling Lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - So, the revenue from one gallon is 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10.

3. **Profit per Gallon:**
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon.
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5.

4. **Total Profit:**
   - They made a total profit of $25.
   - To find out how many gallons they sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon.
   - Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

5. **Total Cost of Lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon.
   - Total cost of lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Zaid earns 6000 dollars a month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. So, the money left after rent and car fuel is:
   \[
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. He donates half of the remaining money to charity:
   \[

"Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's add up all the crabs:
Bo's crabs: 40
Monic's crabs: 36
Rani's crabs: 46

Total crabs: \(40 + 36 + 46 = 122\)

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."

Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, and these are 5 times the number of white carnations. So, to find out how many white carnations she ordered, we divide 200 by 5:

\[ 200 \div 5 = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Now, Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

So, Sandra ordered 160 red roses.

Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra happy.

The answer is: \(\boxed{160}\)"

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes for the faster team to finish the race. Each of the four runners on the faster team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. So, we multiply 55 seconds by 4:
\[ 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the less well-rounded team to finish the race. The first runner runs in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so he runs in:
\[ 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so he runs in:
\[ 57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so he runs in:
\[ 54 - 3 = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Now, we add up the times for all four runners:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between the two teams:
\[ 220 - 212 = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 8 seconds. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this together!

When we roll a six-sided die, there are 6 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 good outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 good outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The chance of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since we roll the die twice, we multiply the chances:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the chances
Now, we see that:
- The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
- The chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we divide the two chances:
\[ \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. To say this as a percentage:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to happen than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many as her mom, so Jenna picked \(20 \div 2 = 10\) apples.

Together, they picked \(20 + 10 = 30\) apples.

So, the answer is 30."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - So, the total straw for hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Total Straw:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - So, the straw for rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Rats:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - So, the number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\).

5. **Rats in Each Cage:**
   - The rats are in 3 cages.
   - So, the number of rats in each cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

The number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?

Let's do it step by step:

1. **First Month:**
   - Interest: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
   - Total: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

2. **Second Month:**
   - Interest: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
   - Total: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

3. **Third Month:**
   - Interest: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
   - Total: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

The answer is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Buying Bags:**
   - The trader buys each bag for $20.
   - If he buys \( x \) bags, the total cost for buying is \( 20x \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Transporting Bags:**
   - It costs $2 to transport each bag.
   - So, for \( x \) bags, the total transport cost is \( 2x \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and the transport cost.
   - Total cost = \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

4. **Revenue from Selling Bags:**
   - The trader sells each bag for $30.
   - So, for \( x \) bags, the total revenue is \( 30x \) dollars.

5. **Profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.
   - So, we have the equation: \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 8x = 400 \).
   - Divide both sides by 8: \( x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \).

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{50}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The friends spent $20.25 on tickets.
2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, so:
   \[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
   They spent $15.75 on food.
3. They went on 2 rides, and each ride cost $33, so:
   \[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
   They spent $66 on rides.
4. Now, let's add up all the costs:
   \[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]
   The total cost is $102.
5. They agreed to split the cost evenly, so each friend pays:
   \[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each friend paid $34.

The answer is: \boxed{34}"

3. So, for 10 ducks, the total amount of insects needed each week is:
   \[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

4. There are 7 days in a week, so to find out how much insects they need each day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
   \[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of 10 ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Tom plants 10 trees every year and chops down 2 trees every year. So, he gains 8 trees each year.

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, he will have:
\[ 50 + (8 \times 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

Subtracting the dead trees from the total, he will have:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees Tom has left is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
2. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs half of 40 grams, which is 20 grams.

Now, let's find out the total weight of the chocolate bars:
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is \(25 \times 40 = 1000\) grams.

Next, let's find out the total weight of the candied apples:
- There are 80 candied apples.
- Each candied apple weighs 20 grams.
- So, the total weight of the candied apples is \(80 \times 20 = 1600\) grams.

Finally, let's add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
- Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
- Total weight = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much half a dozen plates cost. The problem says each half dozen plate costs $6000.
2. Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, we subtract $1200 from $6000:
   \[
   6000 - 1200 = 4800
   \]
   So, twenty dozen cups cost $4800.
3. Next, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen is:
   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240
   \]
   So, there are 240 cups.
4. Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. We divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30.
2. She also wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $20. So, 2 pairs will cost \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.
3. The total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Now, let's see how much money Sara has and how much she can earn:

1. Sara already has $10 saved.
2. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
3. So, Sara has \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars now.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to have enough money, we need to see how much more she needs:
- She needs \(70 - 30 = 40\) more dollars.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns each time:

"Gary likes to walk around the park, which is a rectangle. The park is 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide. To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to know the perimeter of the park first.

The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we can calculate the perimeter as:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time Gary spends walking is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane saw 100 people in the store.

On the second day, she saw 50 more people than the first day, so she saw \(100 + 50 = 150\) people.

By the end of the third day, the total number of people Sloane saw was 500.

To find out how many people she saw on the third day, we need to subtract the number of people she saw on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of people on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

The number of people Sloane saw on the third day is 250.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know that both pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute.
2. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's use some simple math to find out how much water is in the small pool now.

First, let's say the small pool now has \( S \) gallons of water. Then the big pool now has \( 4S \) gallons of water.

Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because it lost 4 gallons each minute for 4 minutes).
The big pool had \( 4S + 16 \) gallons four minutes ago.

According to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The answer is: \(\boxed{8}\)"

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, let's find out how old they will be in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). So, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.
4. The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. We do this by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

Let's do the subtraction:
\[ 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

The answer is: \(\boxed{54}\)"
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes on one sudoku puzzle. 

For the crossword puzzles:
- She solved 3 puzzles.
- So, \(10 \text{ minutes} \times 3 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

For the sudoku puzzles:
- She solved 8 puzzles.
- So, \(5 \text{ minutes} \times 8 = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time for both:
- Total time = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

The correct answer is: 70 minutes."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The water tank starts with 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. So, we need to find out how much water is left:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Then, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left. So, the rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Now, we add the rainwater to the water left in the tank:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
90 + 50 = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"The company spent $15,000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $5,000. So, to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the two amounts together:

"Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour, and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?

First, let's find out how much Carlos pays:
- Carlos rents the canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses it for 3 hours.
- So, Carlos pays \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much Benji pays:
- Benji rents the banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses it for 5 hours.
- So, Benji pays \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, let's add the amounts they both pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days.

The answer is 9."
"James has 30 fire type cards, 20 grass type cards, and 40 water type cards. If he loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 more grass type cards, we need to find out the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.

First, let's count the new number of each type of card:
- Fire type: 30 (no change)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

Next, we need to find the chance that a randomly picked card is a water type. We do this by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \frac{32}{96} \times 100 = 33.33 \]

When we round 33.33 to the nearest whole number, we get 33.

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Chad ordered a burrito. The base burrito costs $6.50. He added extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. The sauces cost $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50. He also upgraded his meal for $3.00. 

Let's add it all up:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Sauces: $0.50
- Upgrade: $3.00

So, $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00. So, we subtract $5.00 from $14.00:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

The answer is: \boxed{9.00}"
"Kalinda and her mom are working on a 360-piece puzzle. Kalinda can put 4 pieces in one minute, and her mom can put 2 pieces in one minute (because 4 divided by 2 is 2).

Together, they can put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces in one minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in one minute:

360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. There are 120 baby watermelons at the start.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, we need to find 30% of 120:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   This means 36 watermelons are ready, so the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, we need to find 3/4 of 84:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   This means 63 watermelons are ready, so the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - So, the total cost for the cars is \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \).

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - He pays 10% tax on the cars.
   - So, the tax is \( 10\% \) of $240,000.
   - \( 10\% \) means \( 0.10 \).
   - So, the tax is \( 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \).

3. **Registration cost:**
   - He pays $1,000 for registration on each car.
   - So, the total registration cost is \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \).

4. **Total cost:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs.
   - Total cost = Cost of cars + Tax + Registration cost.
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \).

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is \( \boxed{276000} \)."
"On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collected:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know there are 50 ants in the garden.
2. The number of bugs is half the number of ants. So, we need to divide the number of ants by 2 to find the number of bugs.
   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
3. Now, we need to find the total number of insects by adding the number of ants and bugs together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75

First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean:
\[ \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]
So, 12 penguins swim in the ocean.

Next, let's find out how many penguins go to the cave:
\[ \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]
So, 12 penguins go to the cave.

Now, let's find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing:
\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

To figure this out, we need to know how many slices each friend will have and how many slices each pizza has.

1. John has 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices. So, we need to find out how many slices in total are needed:
   \[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

2. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
   \[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Ram buys 25 pens.
2. For every 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen.
3. From 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]
4. Now he has:
   \[
   25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]
5. He uses these 5 pens to make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}

20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:
   \[
   300 = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. Now, we need to find out how many students are left after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students are left.

3. Next, we need to find out how many students went out through exit B. Since \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:
   \[
   420 = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C. Since the rest of the students went out through exit C, we calculate:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

   \]
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has:
   \[
   \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
4. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
   \[

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.
2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. So, Mike gets \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.
3. Mike also sends 6 letters a week because he responds to each letter.
4. Each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.
5. Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.
6. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{3.6}\) hours."
"Jason has a phone plan for 1000 minutes each month. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day. This month has 30 days, so he talks to his boss for:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. So, the difference in the number of snails is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours each day.
3. So, each day she charges: $250 * 6 = $1500.
4. She needs to do this 4 times a week.
5. So, each week she charges: $1500 * 4 = $6000.
6. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
7. So, for 5 weeks, she charges: $6000 * 5 = $30000.
8. After the movie, she gives a 10% discount.
9. 10% of $30000 is: $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.
10. So, the discount is $3000.

"On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many, so she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's add up the cookies:
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, the calories Sue's sister ate are:
- \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The calories Sue ate are:
- \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
2. First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood:
   \[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]
3. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood is:
   \[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]
4. The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood is left.
5. To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:
   \[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"
"Nancy has 8 books that are late, and each book costs $0.50 to return. So, for 8 books, she has to pay:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 because one of her books is over a week late.

So, the total amount she has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

The correct answer is: $6.00."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Andrea's Apples:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Jamal's Apples:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - So, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

3. **Jamal's Bananas:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

4. **Andrea's Bananas:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - So, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

5. **Total Fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.
   - The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

So, the total number of fruits is \(\boxed{168}\)."
"To find out how much flour Carla needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to know how many cookies Carla is making in total:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies. So, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies.
   - If 12 cookies need 2 cups, then 66 cookies will need:
   - \( \frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \times 2 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups} \)

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies. The answer is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 9,300 pennies in the cup.
2. We need to find two thirds of 9,300 pennies.
3. To do this, we divide 9,300 by 3 and then multiply by 2:
   \[
   \frac{9300}{3} = 3100
   \]
   \[
   3100 \times 2 = 6200
   \]
   So, the stack has 6,200 pennies.
4. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100 to get the dollar amount:
   \[
   6200 \div 100 = 62
   \]
   Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is $62.

So, $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount of money they have combined is $400."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The house costs $350,000.
2. There's a brokerage fee of 5% of $350,000:
   \[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]
3. There's also a transfer fee of 12% of $350,000:
   \[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]
4. The total extra cost is:

"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some money for transfer fees and brokerage fees. The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000, and the brokerage fees are 5% of $400,000. He also had to pay $250,000 to clear the remaining loan on the house.

First, let's find out how much the transfer fees are:
\[ 3\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's find out how much the brokerage fees are:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fees together:
\[ 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan had to pay $32,000 in fees. He also had to pay $250,000 to clear the remaining loan. To find out how much money Mr. Tan has left after paying all these, we need to subtract the fees and the loan from the selling price:
\[ 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"To find out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to add up the time it takes to heat the oil to different temperatures and the time to cook the chicken.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time to heat to 400 degrees.
   - So, the time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The body of the sweater needs 900 stitches.
2. The collar needs a tenth of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]
3. The rosette needs twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
   \]
4. Now, add the stitches for the collar and rosette:
   \[
   90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches}
   \]
5. The whole sweater needs 1800 stitches, so the stitches for the sleeves are:
   \[
   1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 \text{ stitches}
   \]
6. Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve needs:
   \[
   \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - So, \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   - So, \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam is \( S \) years old, then Ruby is \( 6S \) years old.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old, and Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old.
3. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
5. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]
6. Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[

3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:
- Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not more than 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, let's add up all their points:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

So, the total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

The total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
83"
"Will bought 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8 years old and will wash 8 oranges. His youngest son is 4 years old (half the age of the oldest) and will wash 4 oranges. So, the total number of oranges washed is 8 + 4 = 12. 

Now, to find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the washed oranges from the total oranges:
15 - 12 = 3

So, the number of unwashed oranges is 3."
"Okay, let's count the exercises Darren did over two days.

On the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

On the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 × 2 = 40

Now, let's add them up:

First day total:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Second day total:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Adding all together:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total exercises:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

So, the total count of the activities he did in the two days is 370."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
2. There are 5 people in the family.
3. They eat rice at lunch and dinner, so that's 2 meals a day.

First, let's find out how much rice the family eats in one meal:
- 0.2 kg/person * 5 people = 1 kg per meal.

Now, let's find out how much rice they eat in one day:
- 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg per day.

Next, let's find out how much rice they eat in one week:
- 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg per week.

Now, we have a 42 kg bag of rice. To find out how many weeks it will last:
- 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The answer is: \(\boxed{3}\)"
"Sam wants to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell the bread. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates.

Let's add up the crates he sold:
- Weekend: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's add these numbers:
20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so we need to find out how many crates he was short:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was short by 55 crates from his target.

The answer is: \boxed{55}"
"Carmen starts by bidding $200. Then, each time someone else bids, she bids $50 more. There are 3 other people bidding, so Carmen bids 4 times in total.

1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Fourth bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add all the bids together:
$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100

So, the desk costs Carmen $1100. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"John drives to work and back every day. His work is 30 miles away, so each day he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, which is 60 miles in total.

He works 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.

He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.

He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

He also gives a $150 bonus every month, so in a year, he gives \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars in bonuses.

So, the total cost for the driving service in a year is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

The correct answer is: 31800."
"On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to add the minutes from Monday and Sunday and then double that number.

First, let's add the minutes from Monday and Sunday:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \]

Now, we need to double this number to find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \]

So, Peter needs to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, we need to know how many pieces of paper are used. Each piece of paper, when folded, makes 4 pages. So, we need to divide the total number of pages by 4.

"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $25. Then she spent an extra $10 on rides. So, she spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35. 

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the money she started with:

$50 - $35 = $15

So, the amount of money left is $15.

The answer is: $15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise has 250 books in total.
2. She has 50 books left unsold.
3. So, she sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. This year, she sold 45 books.
5. Last year, she sold twice as many as this year, so \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books.
6. To find out how many books she sold the year before last, we subtract the books sold in the first and current year from the total books sold: \(200 - 90 - 45 = 65\) books.
7. Each book sells for $20.
8. So, the money she earned last year is \(65 \times 20 = 1300\) dollars.

The answer is: \(\boxed{1300}\)"
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company does well.

First, let's find out how much Watson earns in a day:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's find out how much Watson earns in a week without the bonus:
\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company did well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April usually has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for April are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people. He beats 80% of them. 

First, we need to find out how many people he beat. We do this by multiplying 20 by 0.80:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is 4.

The answer is: 4"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. In the morning, two-thirds of the loaves are sold. So, we need to find two-thirds of 60:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After selling 40 loaves in the morning, the bakery has:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
   \]
4. In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold. So, we need to find half of 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum makes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, we need to see how many times 3 goes into 15.
   - \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
   - So, 5 extra arms will grow.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum makes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, we need to see how many times 5 goes into 15.
   - \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \)
   - So, 3 extra legs will grow.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - We add the extra arms and legs together.
   - \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)
   - So, 8 new limbs will grow in 15 days.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
   \[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]
   So, he spends $600 on suits.

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
   \[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]
   So, he spends $150 on suitcases.

3. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. A business suit costs $100, so:
   \[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
   \[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]
   So, the flight ticket costs $1200.

4. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he can spend:
   \[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]
   So, he can spend $4000 on the trip.

5. Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
   \[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]
   So, he spends $1950 on these items.

6. The amount left for buying gifts is:
   \[ 4000 - 1950 = 1950 \]
   So, he has $1950 left for gifts.

The answer is \(\boxed{1950}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. In the family, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, for these 3 people:
   - \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\)

2. The rest of the family (2 people) eat 2 eggs each day. So, for these 2 people:
   - \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\)

3. Now, let's add the eggs eaten by both groups:
   - \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\)

4. Since they eat eggs every day, in a week (7 days), the total number of eggs consumed is:
   - \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\)

So, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

So, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cera's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Cera is 46 years old now.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - So, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - The population six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - So, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know the football team has 105 members in total. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Now, we can write the equation for the total number of players:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply everything by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Martha invited some families to her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, let's count how many people that is:

- For the 2 families with 6 people: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- For the 3 families with 4 people: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

But some people couldn't come. 8 people couldn't come because they were sick, and 2 more people couldn't come because they had other plans. So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, to find out how many people came to the party, we subtract the people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who came to Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. The store already had 50 marbles. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
- Marbles bought from Johanna: 20
- Marbles already in the store: 50
- Marbles given by his father: 8

Total marbles = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kgs. So, the total weight of the marbles is:
78 marbles \(\times\) 2 kgs/marble = 156 kgs.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kgs."
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to know the volume of the pool and the cost per cubic foot.

1. First, let's find the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. Now, we know that it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill the pool. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 120 \times 0.10 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

3. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]
4. Now, we add up all the children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

To find out how many poles are needed, we can set up a simple division:

Since 3 wires are needed for 1 pole, we can find out how many poles are needed by dividing the total number of wires by 3.

So, we do:
\[ \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

This means we need 15 poles to match the 45 wires.

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{15}\)"
"At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women. That's a total of 40 people.

"The book costs $4. The magazine costs half of that, so it's $4 ÷ 2 = $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so it's $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know Jam has 26 pencils in total. She has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. So, the 3 boxes must have:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \text{ pencils} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, each box has:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, Meg has 46 pencils. So, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils} \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Shannon makes her iced coffee by adding ice cubes and cream. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. She wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and adds 15 milliliters of cream.

First, we need to find out how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]
So, she needs 5 ice cubes.

Next, we calculate how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Then, we add the weakening effect of the cream, which is 15 milliliters. So, the total weakening is:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in a primary school. Imagine you have a toy store where you can trade your old toys for new ones. The rule is that you need to give 2 old toys to get 1 new toy.

Now, 5 friends came to the store and each got 7 new toys. To get 1 new toy, they need to give 2 old toys. So, to get 7 new toys, they need to give:

\[ 7 \text{ new toys} \times 2 \text{ old toys/new toy} = 14 \text{ old toys} \]

So, the 5 friends brought in 14 old toys.

The answer is: **14**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are. The problem says that junior programmers are 2/5 of the total number of employees. There are 100 employees in total.
   - So, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total payment to all junior programmers is:
   - \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

3. Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers. So, each senior programmer gets:
   - \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \) per month.

4. There are 60 senior programmers (since there are 100 employees in total and 40 are junior programmers, so \( 100 - 40 = 60 \)).
   - The total payment to all senior programmers is \( 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \).

5. Now, we add the payments to both junior and senior programmers to get the total payment:
   - \( 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \).

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \( \boxed{224000} \)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Some people got on the bus at the start. Let's call this number \( x \).
2. At the first stop, 5 more people got on. So now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So the number of people now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \), which simplifies to \( x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation: \( x + 6 = 20 \). We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides: \( x = 20 - 6 \).
6. So, \( x = 14 \).

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]

He gives 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \]

Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]

He eats 3 more that night, so he has:
\[ 36 - 3 = 33 \]

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has:
\[ 33 - 2 = 31 \]

So, Oscar has \(\boxed{31}\) lollipops."

"Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax.

First, let's look at Job A:
- Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year.
- The tax is 20% of $30,000, so 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000.
- The net pay is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's look at Job B:
- Job B pays $42,000 a year.
- There is a $6,000 property tax, so the remaining pay is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
- The tax on the remaining pay is 10% of $36,000, so 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600.
- The net pay is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

So, Job B has a higher net pay. The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The answer is: $8,400."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate:
   \[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
   So, there are 88 ruined castles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
   So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

The answer is 44 unmanned ruined castles."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

**Furniture United:**
- They want $1,350 first.
- Then, they want 6 more payments of $350 each.
- So, 6 payments * $350 = $2,100.
- Total cost = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

**Cozy Homes:**
- They want $1,100 first.
- Then, they want 9 more payments of $250 each.
- So, 9 payments * $250 = $2,250.
- Total cost = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

**Difference:**
- The difference is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

So, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.

The correct answer is: $100."

First, we need to count all the paintball guns they have together:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard (or RJ) has 5 guns.
- Richard (again) has 5 guns.

So, let's add them up:
8 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 28 guns in total.

Now, they want to share these guns equally. There are 4 people, so we need to divide the total number of guns by 4:
28 ÷ 4 = 7

So, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 7 guns.

The answer is: 7 guns.

Correct option: A"

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We have 200 students in total.
2. We need to split them into 3 groups.
3. Two of the groups have the same number of students.
4. The third group has 10 fewer students than the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two larger groups has \( x \) students. Then the smallest group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

So, the total number of students can be written as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Now, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group will have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total. These animals are either chickens or cows. We know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is \( C \). Then the number of chickens would be \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows:
\[ 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, let's count the legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

The total number of legs from the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

3 (starting balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls.

But during the show, he drops 3 balls. Out of these, 2 are caught and 1 is lost. So he has:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls left.

So, Josh starts juggling with \boxed{4} balls."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container with one of each animal is 260 pounds.

The answer is: 260 pounds."

"Okay, let's count the legs of the tables in the restaurant!

First, we have 40 tables with 4 legs each. So, we multiply 40 by 4:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]
This means the 4-legged tables have 160 legs.

Next, we have 50 tables with 3 legs each. So, we multiply 50 by 3:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]
This means the 3-legged tables have 150 legs.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 - (20 + 7) = 36 - 27 = 9 \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

The answer is: 9"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much the discount is on one shirt. The shirt costs $30 and there's a 40% discount. To find 40% of $30, we do:
   \[ 30 \times \frac{40}{100} = 30 \times 0.40 = 12 \]
   So, the discount on one shirt is $12.

2. Now, we need to find out how much one shirt costs after the discount. We subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]
   So, one shirt costs $18 after the discount.

3. Davos bought 2 shirts, so we need to find out how much 2 shirts cost after the discount. We multiply the price of one shirt by 2:

2. Now, let's find out how much money they make from silos each day. They sell 5 silos and each silo is sold for $220.
   \[ 5 \text{ silos} \times \$220 = \$1100 \]

3. Next, we need to find out how much more money they are making now compared to before.
   \[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

4. Finally, we need to find out what percentage this extra money is of the original amount. We do this by dividing the extra money by the original amount and then multiplying by 100.
   \[ \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"John did some fun things on his vacation. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, he spent:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long. So, he spent:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time he spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total vacation time, we can use this:
\[ 0.30 \times \text{Total Time} = 15 \]
So, the total time is:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time he spent sightseeing is:

"Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends can play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and the go-karts cost $10 each ride.

First, let's find out how much it costs for one person to do all these activities:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 × 2 = $20
- Total for one person: $5 + $20 = $25

Morgan also wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so the total cost for Morgan herself is:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Go-karts: $20
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Total for Morgan: $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, we subtract the cost for Morgan from her total budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
- Total budget: $90
- Cost for Morgan: $30
- Remaining budget: $90 - $30 = $60

The cost for each friend is the same as the cost for one person, which is $25. So, we divide the remaining budget by the cost for each friend to find out how many friends she can invite:
- Number of friends: $60 ÷ $25 = 2.4

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

The answer is: \boxed{2}"

"Billy has $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. After buying candy, he spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs:
- Each gumball costs $0.05.
- He bought 40 gumballs.
- So, the total cost for gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much money Billy had before buying gumballs:
- He spent $2 on gumballs.
- He initially had $10.
- So, the amount left after buying gumballs is \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money Billy had before buying candy:
- He spent half of his remaining money on gumballs.
- Let's say he had \( x \) dollars before buying gumballs.
- According to the problem, \( \frac{x}{2} = 2 \).
- Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 4 \) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much money Billy spent on candy:
- He initially had $10.
- He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
- So, the amount spent on candy is \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought:
- The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
- He spent $6 on candy.
- So, the number of pounds of candy is \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

The answer is \(\boxed{4}\) pounds."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Carver is 45 years old, and he is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We need to find out how old his son is.

First, let's say Carver's son is \( x \) years old. According to the problem, Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, we can write it as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
2. Then it goes 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
3. To go from the third city back to the first city, it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two trips. So, the distance is \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances for one trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance it travels in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 by 900:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. A collie bed needs the average of the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. So, we add 8 and 2, then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

And for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Mark needs \(\boxed{23}\) pounds of stuffing."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Each frame also needs to be etched, which costs an extra 20% of $20.
   - 20% of $20 is $4.
   - So, each frame costs $20 + $4 = $24.
   - For 44 seniors, the total cost is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will get pins that cost $5 each.
   - So, the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 of 44 is 11.
   - Each officer gets a cord that costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Add up all the costs: $1056 (frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198.

The final answer is: \boxed{1198}"
"If Ethan makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, he saves 20% of the $400 cost. 

To find out how much he saves:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, the cost after saving is:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

The total cost if Ethan makes his own wallpaper is $320. 

The answer is: $320"
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. That means they sold 14 × 2 = 28 pairs on Saturday because they sold double the number of shoes. On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, which is 28 ÷ 2 = 14 pairs, but 6 pairs were returned. So, they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

So, the total pairs sold is 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 × 2 = 100 shoes.

The answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Hallie had dance practice on different days of the week. Let's count the hours she practiced each day:

- On Tuesday, she practiced for 1 hour.
- On Thursday, she practiced for 2 hours.
- On Saturday, she practiced for twice as long as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:

So, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give 2 kg of milk each day.

For the 15 sheep that give 1 kg each:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

For the 15 sheep that give 2 kg each:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, add the milk from both groups:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

**45**"
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She gave 1 roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

3. **Remaining pupils after those who like blue are subtracted**: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils.
4. **Number of pupils who like green**: One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pupils like green.
5. **Number of pupils who like yellow**: The rest of the pupils like yellow, so \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) pupils like yellow.

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"Lucy sells apples for $4 each. On Monday, she sold all the apples she had for $56. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide $56 by $4:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Now, we add up all the apples she picked over the three days:

\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{50}\)"

The number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to add the interest to the money she borrowed and then split it into 5 equal parts.

First, let's find out the interest. The interest rate is 10% for a whole year, but Karan borrowed the money for only 5 months. So, we need to find out what 10% of the money is for 5 months.

10% of $3,650 is:
\[ 3650 \times 0.10 = 365 \]

But since she borrowed the money for only 5 months, we need to find out what part of 10% is for 5 months. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{5}{12} \times 365 = 152.08 \]

So, the total amount she has to pay back is:
\[ 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Now, we need to split this amount into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 each month.

The correct answer is: \boxed{760.42}"

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers every hour and did this for 5 hours. So, we need to find out how many kilometers she hiked in total:
\[ 9 \text{ km/h} \times 5 \text{ h} = 45 \text{ km} \]

Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe:
\[ 112 \text{ km} - 45 \text{ km} = 67 \text{ km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The answer is: 67 km"
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:
- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

So, the total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Millie makes lemonade and sells it. She spends $18 to make 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1. She sells 4 cups every hour. 

First, let's find out how much money she makes from selling all the lemonade:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying the supplies:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 hectare is worth in terms of the whole land. 

If 2/5 of the land is 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 of the land would be:

\[ \frac{12.8}{2} = 6.4 \text{ hectares} \]

Now, if 1/5 of the land is 6.4 hectares, then the whole land (5/5) would be:

\[ 6.4 \times 5 = 32 \text{ hectares} \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

The answer is: \(\boxed{32}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The choir has 52 members, and half of them are girls. So, we need to find out how many girls are there:
   - Number of girls = 52 ÷ 2 = 26

2. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, we need to find out how many girls can't make it:
   - Girls who can't make it = 26 ÷ 2 = 13

3. So, the number of girls who can perform is:
   - Girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

4. The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.
2. Together, they have 165 popsicles.
3. To find out how many parts make up the total, we add the numbers in the ratio: 5 + 6 = 11.
4. Now, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts: 165 ÷ 11 = 15. This means each part is 15 popsicles.
5. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
6. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.
7. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Tim wants to save money by canceling his cable and getting streaming services. 

Netflix costs $10 a month. 
Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a bundle, he gets a 20% discount. 

First, let's find out how much Hulu and Disney Plus cost after the discount:
- The normal cost for both is $10 + $10 = $20.
- With a 20% discount, he pays 80% of $20.
- 80% of $20 is $20 × 0.80 = $16.

Now, add the cost of Netflix:
- Netflix is $10.
- Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $16.
- So, the total cost is $10 + $16 = $26.

Tim's old cable package cost $60 a month. 
So, the money he saves is:
- $60 - $26 = $34.

The answer is: $34."
"Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, which is like 4 big time blocks. She spends half that time recording, so that's 2 big time blocks. She spends 90 minutes editing, which is 1 and a half big time blocks (since 60 minutes make one big time block).

Now, let's add up all the time she spends:
- Writing: 4 big time blocks
- Recording: 2 big time blocks
- Editing: 1 and a half big time blocks

So, the total time is:
4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 big time blocks

Carol spends 1.5 big time blocks editing. To find out what percentage of her total time this is, we do:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of power each hour.
2. He uses it for 8 hours a day, so the total power used each day is:
   \[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]
3. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:
   \[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the power used each day will be:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Over 30 days, the total savings will be:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese he needs:
- For 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat.
- For 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, let's find out how much it will cost:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, it will cost 5 × $7.00 = $35.00
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, it will cost 5 × $3.00 = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese:

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese. The correct answer is \boxed{50}."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Initial Corns and Cannolis:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.

2. **Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis.
   - So, the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **Buying Corns:**
   - He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he buys \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - So, the new total of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Total Corns and Cannolis:**
   - Now, we add the new total of cannolis and corns.
   - The total is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a speed of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After reading, Toby needs 10 more minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he needs is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. So, the time he will be early is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and got paid $15 per hour.
   - So, each employee got \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars in May.
   - For 40 employees, the total payment was \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars.

2. In June, 1/4 of the employees left. So, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) employees left.
   - That means \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) employees were left in June.
   - Each of these 30 employees also worked 40 hours a week and got paid $15 per hour.
   - So, each employee got \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars in June.
   - For 30 employees, the total payment was \( 600 \times 30 = 18000 \) dollars.

3. To find the total payment for both months, we add the payments from May and June:
   - Total payment = \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is **42000** dollars."
"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10. She bought some taffy, seashells, and magnets.

First, let's look at the taffy. The taffy is on sale: buy 1 pound for $3 and get 1 pound for half off. So, for 2 pounds, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (half of $3).

So, the taffy costs:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The magnets cost:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

So, the seashells and magnets together cost:
\[ 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, she has:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, Sally has $3 left. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Tim bought some fireworks. The first pack cost $400, and the second pack cost twice as much, so it's $800. He got a 20% discount on both packs, so he saved $240 (20% of $1200). After the discount, the fireworks cost $960. He also bought a finale firework for $150. 

So, the total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The answer is \boxed{1110}."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies every night. She wants enough cookies to last for 30 days. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we need to know how many dozens of cookies that is. Since 1 dozen is 12 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

The answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
2. 1% of these candles will explode. So, we need to find 1% of 50,000.
3. To find 1% of 50,000, we can use this simple calculation: \( 50,000 \times \frac{1}{100} = 500 \).

So, 500 candles will explode.

4. 5% of the candles smell like wet dog. But the problem doesn't say how many of these will also explode. Since we don't have that information, we can't say exactly how many will both smell like wet dog and explode.

But if we assume that the defects are independent, we can estimate that 5% of the 500 candles that will explode will also smell like wet dog. So, we calculate 5% of 500:
\[ 500 \times \frac{5}{100} = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is 25.

The answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out the price of one blouse after the discount. The original price of each blouse is $20, and it is on sale at 30% off. So, we need to find 70% of $20 because 100% - 30% = 70%.

2. To find 70% of $20, we can do:
   \[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
   So, the price of one blouse after the discount is $14.

3. Now, Misha picks 4 blouses. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the price of one blouse by 4:
   \[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56.

The correct answer is: \boxed{56}"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \(30 \div 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's say Joanne gathers \(x\) apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's see what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

Together, they have gathered 500 apples. So, we can write:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[150 + x = 500\]
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know:
- Camels and dromedaries together have 180 heads.
- Camels and dromedaries together have 304 humps.

Camels have 2 humps and 1 head each.
Dromedaries have 1 hump and 1 head each.

Let's use some simple math:
1. If we have 180 heads, and each animal has 1 head, then we have 180 animals in total.
2. But we also know there are 304 humps. Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can set up an equation.

Let's say:
- \( c \) is the number of camels.
- \( d \) is the number of dromedaries.

From the heads, we know:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

From the humps, we know:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now, let's solve these:
1. From \( c + d = 180 \), we can say \( d = 180 - c \).
2. Substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

So, there are 124 camels. Now, we can find the number of dromedaries:
\[ d = 180 - c \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day. So, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
   \[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

2. Over the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, the distance for the next 2 days is:
   \[ 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \]

3. On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
   \[ 0 \text{ km} \]

4. During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is:
   \[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

5. Now, let's add all the distances together:
   \[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, to find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find Timothy's locker size, we multiply Zack's size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Oliver is at 3,000 feet and the comb is at 6,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb, we need to subtract Oliver's height from the comb's height.

So, 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet.

The answer is 3,000 feet."
"Mr. Josue got some money from two banks to start his store. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much as the first one. So, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Mr. Josue also had $5000 of his own money. Now, let's add all the money together:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Josue now has:
\[ \boxed{17000} \text{ dollars} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We start with 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and took away 5 cats each. So, \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away.
3. Now, we have \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left.
4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\) cats ran after the mouse.
5. Now, we have \(30 - 18 = 12\) cats left on the rock.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   - 6 months × $8 = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   - 8 months × $12 = $96

3. **Last 8 months at $14 a month:**
   - 8 months × $14 = $112

Now, let's add all these up:
- $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $256.

The answer is: \boxed{256}"
"The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, which is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 because:
\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.

The difference in the original price between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's count the number of people that can go on the trip using the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 people.
   \[
   4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 people.
   \[
   6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ people}

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 people.
   \[
   10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ people}
   \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to find out how many people can go on the trip:
\[
240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ people}
\]

So, the total number of people that can go on the trip is:
\[

"Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more. The homemade feeders attract more birds. Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade feeders, so:
3 homemade feeders × 30 birds = 90 birds

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders, so:
3 store-bought feeders × 20 birds = 60 birds

Adding them together:
90 birds + 60 birds = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, we need to find 25% of $4 and add it to $4.
   - 25% of $4 is $1 (because 25% is the same as 1/4, and 1/4 of $4 is $1).
   - So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we need to find half of $4.
   - Half of $4 is $2.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

So, the total cost is $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He also wants to have $50 in spending money. So, he needs $100 + $50 = $150 in total.

Each Pokemon card he sells gives him $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money by the price of each card: $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them. If 2/3 of his cards is 100, we can find out how many cards he started with by doing the following:

If 2/3 of the cards is 100, then 1/3 of the cards is 100 ÷ 2 = 50 cards.

So, if 1/3 of the cards is 50, then the total number of cards he started with is 50 × 3 = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

The answer is: 150."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The caterer was supposed to make enough hotdogs for 36 guests.
2. Half of the guests (18 guests) were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each.
3. So, 18 guests x 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs.
4. The other half (18 guests) were supposed to have 1 hotdog each.
5. So, 18 guests x 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs.
6. Total hotdogs prepared = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog:
7. 18 guests already had 2 hotdogs, so they don't need more.
8. 22 guests wanted a second hotdog, so they need 22 more hotdogs.
9. But the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
10. So, 22 needed hotdogs - 54 prepared hotdogs = 22 - 54 = -32 (This means there are extra hotdogs, but we need to find out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog).

Since the caterer prepared enough for 22 guests to have a second hotdog, and there are extra hotdogs, all 22 guests got their second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 0.

The answer is: \boxed{0}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Indras' name has 6 letters.
2. Half of Indras' name is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) letters.
3. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so it has \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) letters.
4. To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the letters in Indras' name and her sister's name: \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much everything costs before the discount.
   - A set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
   - A set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
   - 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

2. Now, let's add these up:
   \[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

3. The store is giving a 20% discount, which means Charlotte only pays 80% of the total cost.
   - To find 80% of $165, we do:
   \[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The answer is: \(\boxed{132}\)"

- Skipping rope costs $6
- Board game costs $11
- Playground ball costs $2

So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we need to see how much money Dora has. She has:
- $2 from her allowance
- $16 from her mother

So, the total money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs. We do this by subtracting the money she has from the total cost:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar."
"Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur killed three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus did. So, we need to find three quarters of 100:

Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons. Prince Walter killed twice as many as Prince Arthur. So, we need to find twice 75:

\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Prince Walter killed 150 dragons. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth of what Prince Walter did. So, we need to find one-fifth of 150:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas and 5 containers. So, we divide 15 by 5:
   \[ 15 \div 5 = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

2. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, we need to find \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 3 gallons:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

3. Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. That means he had $0.05 left, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

The chips cost 40 cents each, and he bought 3 bags. So, the total cost for the chips is 3 × $0.40 = $1.20.

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 ÷ $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared 20 lollipops with his friends. He has 4 friends, so we need to divide the 20 lollipops by 4.

So, the weight of the 2 pieces they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges. They are sharing these oranges with 6 friends, so there are 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people in total.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Antoine is making French onion soup. His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound. So, the cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. So, the cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people. So, the cost per serving is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to know how big the room is. The area is 360 square feet.
2. We also know the length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, the length in feet is:
   \[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]
3. Now, we use the area formula to find the width. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so:
   \[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
   Solving for width:
   \[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]
4. To find the perimeter, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:
   \[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{98}\)"

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, Margareth bought:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Starting Temperature**: Marcus's house is 40 degrees when he wakes up.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven makes the house warmer by 5 degrees every hour. So, for 3 hours, it will make the house:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}

   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
2. Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
3. Jon's run time: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James is 10% faster in the swim, so:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long James took for the run. We know:
\[ 36 + 85 + \text{run time} = 180 \]

So, the run time is:
\[ 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we can find out how long Movie C is in minutes:
\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:
\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Michael's horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:
   \[ 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

2. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:
   \[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

3. Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay cost:
   \[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
   \[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

5. The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
   \[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Rozanne is making eggnog and she has 4 dozen eggs plus 2 more eggs. 

First, let's count the total number of eggs:
- 4 dozen eggs = 4 x 12 = 48 eggs
- Adding the 2 extra eggs: 48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, we can make:
- 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses

Each tray holds 5 glasses. So, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:
- 10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays

So, the answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, Joey starts with 214 points and then he gets 26 more points. So, we add these together:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]
So, Joey now has 240 points.

Next, Marcy starts with 225 points and then she gets 10 more points. So, we add these together:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]
So, Marcy now has 235 points.

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. To find out how much each sneaker cost, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:
   \[ \frac{576}{48} = 12 \]
   So, each sneaker cost $12.

2. On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. To find out how much money he made from these sales, we multiply the number of sneakers by the price:
   \[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]
   So, he made $340 from the flash sale.

3. He had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left. He sold these to a department store for $25 each. To find out how much money he made from these sales, we multiply the number of sneakers by the price:
   \[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]
   So, he made $775 from the department store.

4. To find out the total money he made from all sales, we add the money from the flash sale and the department store:
   \[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]
   So, he made $1115 in total.

5. To find out his profit, we subtract the total cost of the sneakers from the total money he made:
   \[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]
   So, his profit is $539.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, Beatrice bought 6 packets with 8 crayons each. So, we need to multiply 6 by 8:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]
This means she has 48 crayons from these packets.

Next, she bought 4 packets with 16 crayons each. So, we need to multiply 4 by 16:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]
This means she has 64 crayons from these packets.

Now, we need to add the two amounts together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's say the popcorn costs \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - So, the regular ticket option costs $2 less than the super ticket option.
   - We can write this as: $21 - ($15 + \( P \)) = $2

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - $21 - 15 - P = 2
   - 6 - P = 2
   - P = 6 - 2
   - P = 4

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, each balloon costs $45 on the first day.

Two days later, the cost of each balloon increases by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by 170:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons.

The answer is: \boxed{11050}"
"To find out the car's average speed, we need to know how far it traveled and how long it took.

1. The car drove 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance is:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Then, the car drove 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The total distance the car traveled is:
   \[
   120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. The total time the car took is:
   \[
   2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
   \]

5. To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

   \]

So, the car's average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800 and each ruby is worth $1200.

First, let's see how many sapphires she has left:
- She starts with 8 sapphires and trades away 3 sapphires.
- So, she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires left.

Now, let's find out how much money her sapphires are worth:
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- So, 5 sapphires are worth \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much money her rubies are worth:
- She gets 2 rubies in the trade.
- Each ruby is worth $1200.
- So, 2 rubies are worth \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Finally, let's add the value of her sapphires and rubies to find the total value:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**
   - The raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.
   - Volume = width × length × height
   - Volume = 2 × 8 × 2 = 32 cubic feet

2. **Calculate the total volume for 10 raised beds:**
   - Each bed is 32 cubic feet.
   - Total volume = 32 × 10 = 320 cubic feet

3. **Calculate the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag holds 2 cubic feet.
   - Number of bags = 320 ÷ 2 = 160 bags

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each bag costs $12.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 15 red cards.
2. Green cards are 60% more than red cards. So, we need to find 60% of 15:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 15 = \frac{60}{100} \times 15 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the number of green cards is:
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]
3. Yellow cards are the same as the sum of red and green cards:
   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
4. Now, we add all the cards together:
   \[
   15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78

So, the total number of cards is 78.

The answer is: 78"
"Katelyn saw 50 fairies at first. Then, her friend saw 25 fairies join them (half of 50). So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75. After that, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"Okay, let's solve this together!

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, we need to find the total number of puppies:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we find the total number of puppies with spots:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we put in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, add all the weights together:
\[3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490 \text{ pounds}\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4490}{2250} \approx 2.0044

"Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth 2 cents, and a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents. She drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda and 5 plastic bottles of water a week.

First, let's find out how much she earns from the cans:
- She has 3 cans.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from the cans each week.

Next, let's find out how much she earns from the bottles:
- She has 5 bottles.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from the bottles each week.

Now, let's add the earnings from the cans and bottles to find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

Since we want to know how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

So, Kelly paid \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more than Becky."
"Okay, let's solve this together!

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's add them up:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, each room has \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\) pieces of laundry.

Now, we have 80 rooms, so we multiply 15 by 80:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room.

Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks. Then, the number of cookies he can have is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to know how long the remoras are. The problem says each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is half a foot (0.5 feet).

2. Benny saw 2 remoras, so we need to find the total length of the remoras. We do this by multiplying the length of one remora by 2:
   \[ 0.5 \text{ feet} \times 2 = 1 \text{ foot} \]

3. The shark is 10 feet long. We need to find out what percentage 1 foot is of 10 feet. To do this, we use the formula:
   \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

4. Plugging in the numbers:
   \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

1. We know there are 32 kids in Gina's class.
2. Nine kids are allergic to dairy.
3. Six kids are allergic to peanuts.
4. Three kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

To find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of these things, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, but we have to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both because they were counted twice.

So, we do:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of these things.

First, we have 3 groups of employees. Each group has 200 employees. So, we need to multiply 3 by 200 to find out how many employees there are in total:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]
So, there are 600 employees.

Next, each group has 7 tour guides. Since there are 3 groups, we need to multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many tour guides there are in total:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \]
So, there are 21 tour guides.

Now, to find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees and the number of tour guides:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

The correct answer is: 621."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Plane Tickets**: The cost for each ticket is $5000. Since Tom and his wife are going, they need 2 tickets.
   - Total cost for plane tickets = $5000 × 2 = $10,000

2. **Hotel Cost**: The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. But it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend.
   - Increased cost per day = $1500 + ($1500 × 0.20) = $1500 + $300 = $1800
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost = $1800 × 3 = $5400

3. **Total Cost**: Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.
   - Total cost = $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400

So, the total cost of the trip is $15,400.

The correct answer is: \boxed{15400}"
"Ben has 4 blue paint tubes and 3 yellow paint tubes. Jasper has half as many blue paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ blue paint tubes} \]

Jasper also has three times as many yellow paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ yellow paint tubes} \]

To find the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together:

\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

So, Jasper has a total of 11 paint tubes. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we need to find three-quarters of 48 grains.

To do this, we can first find one-quarter of 48 grains:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ grains} \]

Then, we multiply this by 3 to get three-quarters:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, we add the weight of both pennies:
\[ 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

\[

"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, Luri has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gabriel's player can hold up to 100 songs, so he can add:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Luri's player can also hold up to 100 songs, so she can add:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{40}\)"
"Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked. To find out how many oranges he ate, we do this:

\[

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse eats \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).
3. Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so all the horses together eat \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. We need to feed the horses for 5 days, so the total amount of oats needed is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

So, Uncle Ben needs \(\boxed{4}\) bags of oats."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - With the ""buy one get one free"" offer, if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - So, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

2. **Using the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After using the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - In cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

"Okay, let's think about this together. We have two places to have a party for Mark's wife.

**First Place:**
- It costs $200 no matter how many friends come.
- Each friend also needs $5 for food.

**Second Place:**
- Each friend costs $25, and that includes food.

We want to know how many friends need to come so that both places cost the same amount.

Let's say the number of friends is \( x \).

For the first place, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second place, the total cost is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find \( x \) when these costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, 10 friends are needed for both places to cost the same amount.

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

Now, we know that together they found 43 insects. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:
\[ 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum that costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum that costs half of the grape gum, so it costs $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's find out how much each pack of strawberry gum costs.

First, we know the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1

So, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Now, we know the total cost of all the gum is $7. So, the cost of the strawberry gum is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know the house and the lot together cost $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \). Then the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

So, the total cost is:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

This means:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. 

Now, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

100 - 12 = 88 problems left.

On Tuesday, he did 3 times as many as Monday, so:
3 × 12 = 36 problems.

Now he has:
88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he did one-quarter of the remaining problems, so:
1/4 × 52 = 13 problems.

So, he has:
52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

The answer is 39."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks 1 less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 5 quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks 10 quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add them up:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

So, 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

The total number of quarts they can pick together is 29.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The bakers baked 200 loaves of bread.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
3. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

First, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total:
\[ 200 - 93 = 107 \]

Next, we subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining loaves:
\[ 107 - 39 = 68 \]

Finally, we add the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store:
\[ 68 + 6 = 74 \]

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this together!

Jackson has 36 red tulips and he can plant 6 red tulips in each row. So, we need to find out how many rows he can make with the red tulips:
\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Now, Jackson also has 24 blue tulips and he can plant 8 blue tulips in each row. So, we need to find out how many rows he can make with the blue tulips:
\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Heather has a big bag of 27 cups of raisins. She wants to use the raisins to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. She decides to split the raisins equally among these three things.

First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for each thing:
\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per thing} \]

Now, we know she will use 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the 9 cups by \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup per batch:
\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The answer is: \(\boxed{12}\)"
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, we need to find out how much electricity Ada uses now. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour every day. If she uses electricity for 24 hours a day, then:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \, \text{per day} \]

Now, let's find out how much she uses in a week:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \, \text{per week} \]

Next, we need to add the new device. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour. So, for 24 hours a day, it uses:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{kWh} \, \text{per day} \]

Now, let's add this to her current daily usage:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} + 48 \, \text{kWh} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \, \text{per day} \]

For a week, this is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh} \, \text{per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs. The cost is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. So, for her current usage:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$} \]

And for her new usage:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we need to find the difference:
\[ 3528 \, \text{\$} - 3024 \, \text{\$} = 504 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
2. So, to paint a whole house, it would take that person 10 days.
3. If 5 people work together, they can do the work faster.
4. Since 1 person takes 10 days, 5 people can do it in 2 days (because 10 days ÷ 5 people = 2 days).
5. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 2 days, it would be 2 days × 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The answer is: \boxed{48}"
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. She has 2 fewer chairs than sofas, so she has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]
chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]
chairs.

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \]
sofas.

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ 20 + 64 + 22 + 66 = 172 \]

The total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. He paid $48 in total. To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44. If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left to buy more CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD:

\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom could buy 11 more CDs if he didn't buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{11}\)"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for some weeks. He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and for 6 hours for 1 week.

Let's count the total hours:

- For 5 hours each for 2 weeks: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours
- For 6 hours for 1 week: \(6 \times 1 = 6\) hours
- For 4 hours for the rest of the weeks: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) hours (since 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks)

Now, add all the hours together:
\[10 + 6 + 20 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh worked out over 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Starting with 48 people on the bus.**
2. **First stop:**
   - 8 people get off: \(48 - 8 = 40\)
   - 5 times as many people get on: \(5 \times 8 = 40\)
   - So, after the first stop, there are \(40 + 40 = 80\) people on the bus.
3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 people get off: \(80 - 21 = 59\)
   - 3 times fewer people get on: \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\)
   - So, after the second stop, there are \(59 + 7 = 66\) people on the bus.

The final number of people on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, his current age is:
   \[
   27 - 5 = 22
   \]

2. In 8 years, Jame will be:
   \[
   22 + 8 = 30
   \]

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, Jame's cousin will be:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
   \]

4. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
   \[
   55 - 8 = 47
   \]

5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is:
   \[
   47 - 22 = 25
   \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
4. Now, we need to find out how much the 2 monitors cost. We subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
   $2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600.
5. This $600 is the cost of 2 monitors. So, the cost of one monitor is:
   $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The answer is: \boxed{300}"
"Each boy brought back 60 seashells. The girls brought back more seashells. They brought the same amount as the boys plus four times the amount the boys brought. So, each girl brought:

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

The answer is: 300"
"George now has 3 candies left after eating 5. So, before eating, George had:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ candies} \]

Nick had twice as many candies as George originally. So, Nick had:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ candies} \]

The answer is: \(\boxed{16}\)"
"Chenny is 10 years old.
Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is \(10 - 4 = 6\) years old.
Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is \(6 + 2 = 8\) years old.

Anne is 8 years old."
"Sure, let's figure out the total thickness of the four books step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add them up:
- First book: 31 mm
- Second book: 50 mm
- Third book: 45 mm
- Fourth book: 62 mm

Adding these together:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"Emma wants to make 72 vlogs in a month. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Let's add up the vlogs she made so far:

18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Now, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach 72:

72 (total goal) - 54 (vlogs made) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 vlogs in the fourth week to reach her goal.

The answer is: \boxed{18}"
"Okay, let's do this step by step:

1. The dinner cost is $50.
2. We need to add a 20% tip to the $50.
3. To find 20% of $50, we can do this: \( 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \).
4. So, the tip is $10.
5. Now, add the tip to the original cost: \( 50 + 10 = 60 \).
6. The total bill is $60.
7. Since you and your wife are splitting the bill evenly, you each pay half: \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \).

So, you end up paying $30.

The answer is: $30."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Sharing the Money:**
   - There is $18 to share among 3 boys.
   - Each boy gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The next day, he adds another $10:
     \[

"Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so it's split into two halves of 15 days each.

In the first half, Elvis saves the same amount each day. Let's call this amount \( x \).

In the second half, Elvis saves twice as much each day, so he saves \( 2x \) each day.

The total savings for the first half is \( 15x \).

The total savings for the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

So, the total savings for the month is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

We know that the total savings for the month is $1125, so we have:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"Verna bought some fruits. She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, 5 oranges at $0.80 each, and 6 peaches at $0.75 each. She gave $20 to the shopkeeper.

First, let's find out how much she spent on each type of fruit:
- For apples: \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\)
- For oranges: \(5 \times 0.80 = 4.00\)
- For peaches: \(6 \times 0.75 = 4.50\)

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\(4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00\)

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\(20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\)

So, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\).

The correct answer is: \(\$7.00\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task. If he did 20 tasks, he would get:
   \[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]
   So, Jairus gets $16.

2. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. If she did 20 tasks, she would get:
   \[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]
   So, Jenny gets $10.

3. To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
   \[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]
   So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know that Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars.
2. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

So, the total money is:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This means:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day. That's 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, so he walks 6 miles each day. If he works 5 days a week, then he walks:

So, the answer is 30 miles."
"Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written.

1. Writing the alphabet in full twice:
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Writing half of the alphabet once:
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing half of it once: 13 letters.

3. Re-writing everything she has already written:
   - The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything: 65 letters.

4. Calculating the total number of letters written:

So, the answer is 100 pounds."
"Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys.

First, we find out how many toys Jonathan needs in total:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can write:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."

First, we need to find out how much Daniel has to pay for each item:
- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we need to find out the discount. The shop gives a 10% discount, so we calculate 10% of $30.00:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Antonella sold goods worth $2500.
2. The first $1000 she sells earns her 30% commission:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]
   So, she earns $300 from the first $1000.

3. The rest of her sales is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. For this part, she earns 10% commission:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]
   So, she earns $150 from the sales over $1000.

4. Now, we add the two amounts together:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

So, Antonella earned $450 in total.

The correct answer is: $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has:

He has 70 guests, and he wants to give each guest 2 bottles. So, he needs:

\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the bottles he already has from the total bottles needed:

\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

The correct answer is: 92"
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition:
- In cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day:
- The difference in time: \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final answer is: 54 minutes."
"John works 5 hours a day and gets $2 for each hour. So, he earns:
\[ 5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him, we divide $80 by his weekly earnings:

4. Juan's doctor says he should drink 4 cups a day. So, the reduction needed is:
   \[ \text{Reduction} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The answer is: \(\boxed{16}\)"
"Okay, let's count the rodents step by step!

First, we have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each. So, we do:
3 cages × 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters

Next, we have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. So, we do:
3 cages × 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has 45 rodents in total.

The answer is: 45"
"Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 × 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight, we add up all their weights and then divide by the number of friends:
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
540 ÷ 3 = 180 pounds

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

The answer is: 180"
"The sun starts at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. It moves 5 degrees every hour. If it moves for 10 hours, it will move \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees. So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

The final answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"James has 2 sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Each son needs a candle for each year of their age. So, the first son needs 12 candles, and the second son needs 8 candles. In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack of candles has 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in each pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost is 4 packs × $3/pack = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles. The answer is \boxed{12}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first week, Judy read 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so:
   \[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, in 1 minute, she reads:
   \[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

3. Now, we calculate how many pages she read in the first week:
   \[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

4. In the second week, she read 100 pages.

5. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
   \[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is 12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is 12 ÷ 4 = 3 sandwiches. Together, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. So, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5.

The number of sandwiches left is 5."
"Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( N + 7 \), we can write the equation:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half of $1.00, which is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(0.5 + 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's add it all up:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."

"Peter has $70 and wants to spend the same amount each day for 7 days. That means he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends 4 days, so he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

So, the total cost so far is \(\boxed{308}\)."
"Ford grows 40 roses every week. He supplies roses to three flower shops. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses each week. 

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies in a week:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Now, let's see how many roses Ford grows in a month. We assume a month has 4 weeks:
40 roses/week × 4 weeks = 160 roses

Next, we calculate how many roses Ford needs to supply in a month:
65 roses/week × 4 weeks = 260 roses

Now, we find out how many roses Ford lacks:
260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The answer is: \boxed{100}"

Now, we subtract the amount she took out from her initial savings:

\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money remaining in her account after 2 years is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **How much money do they make from selling 10 sandwiches?**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
   - So, for 10 sandwiches, they make \(10 \times 7 = 70\) dollars.

2. **How much does it cost to make 10 sandwiches?**
   - Bread costs $3.00 for 10 sandwiches.
   - Cheeses and condiments cost $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the total cost is \(3 + 30 = 33\) dollars.

3. **How much profit do they make?**
   - Profit is the money they make minus the money they spend.
   - So, the profit is \(70 - 33 = 37\) dollars.

The net profit is $37.00.

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

So, the total number of birds is:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7):
280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day.

The correct answer is: 40"
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Diane started with the number 20.
2. She added half of 20 to 20:
   \[
   20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]
3. Then she divided 30 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]
4. Finally, she multiplied 6 by the difference between 20 and 12:

"Maggie's oven is a bit too hot. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That's 18 degrees more than she set it to. To find out how much that is as a percentage, we do:

\[
\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%
\]

So, her oven is 4% too hot. Now, if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find out what temperature she should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after being 4% too hot. We can find this by dividing 520 by 1.04 (because 100% + 4% = 104% or 1.04):

\[
\frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. The answer is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"To find out how long it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the time for each movie together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is:

"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much less Juan's house is compared to Herb's. Herb's house cost $76,000, and Juan's house is 30% less expensive. So, we need to find 30% of $76,000.
   
   \[ 30\% \text{ of } 76000 = 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

2. Now, we subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the price of Juan's house.
   
   \[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

3. Finally, we add the prices of both houses to find the total value.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500.
2. The note on the jar says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

- Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is \( 0.99B \).
- Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the values of \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Each 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, for 200 grams, we can find out how much protein it has by doing this:

1. First, we find out how much protein is in 100 grams of mushrooms:
   - 100 grams of mushrooms = 3 grams of protein

2. Since John eats 200 grams, we need to double the amount of protein:
   - 200 grams of mushrooms = 2 × 3 grams of protein = 6 grams of protein

So, John gets 6 grams of protein every day.

Now, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
   - 6 grams of protein per day × 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week

So, the answer is 42 grams of protein per week."

"George needs to pay for his dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the total cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars. He also wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

George has already paid $600 as a deposit. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

George earns $15 for each hour he works. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide $3900 by $15:

\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

The answer is: 260"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. 

Let's say the smallest angle is \(x\). Then:
- The second angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\).
- The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

Now, we add these angles together and set them equal to 180 degrees:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

This simplifies to:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now we can find the other angles:
- The second angle is \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees.
- The third angle is \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."

- He has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is 5 nickels, 8 quarters are \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- He has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is 2 nickels, 6 dimes are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- He has 14 nickels, which is already nickels, so 14 nickels are 14 nickels.
- He has 15 pennies. Since 5 pennies make 1 nickel, 15 pennies are \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**
69"
"Okay, let's count the legs of the pets in the store.

- Dogs have 4 legs each. There are 5 dogs, so \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs.
- Cats have 4 legs each. There are 2 cats, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs.
- Birds have 2 legs each. There are 10 birds, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[20 + 8 + 20 = 48\]

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48.

The answer is: 48"
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He makes it bigger by 50%, so we need to add half of 8 pounds to 8 pounds:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

But 12 pounds is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight Jamaal now uses is \(\boxed{10}\) pounds."
"Okay, let's count the games Steve has step by step:

1. **Birthday Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.

2. **First Year:**
   - Steve buys 1 game each month for 12 months.
   - So, he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.

3. **Second Year:**
   - Steve buys 2 games each month for 12 months.
   - So, he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.

4. **Third Year:**
   - Steve buys 4 games each month for 12 months.
   - So, he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

5. **Christmas Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games each Christmas for 3 years.
   - So, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all the games together:
- Birthday games: 5
- First year games: 12
- Second year games: 24
- Third year games: 48
- Christmas games: 15

Total games: \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we need to find out how fast the plane is going. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, we divide 1200 by 3 to find the speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take to travel 2000 miles at this speed. We use the same formula, but this time we divide the distance by the speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 5 more hours to travel 2000 miles.

The answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, he can make:
   \[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in 1 hour. So, Marissa can make:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

3. If they work for 12 hours:
   - Ruiz can make:
     \[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]
   - Marissa can make:
     \[ 90 \times 12 = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

4. Together, they can make:
   \[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Howard spends $8 on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is $16. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times what he spent on Tuesday, which is $64. 

To find out how much money he has left, we need to add up all the money he spent and then subtract that from the $100 he originally had.

So, the total spent is:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Now, subtract the total spent from the original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

So, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first 4 hours:
   - Patrick sold 15 cups each hour.
   - Each cup was sold for $0.50.
   - So, each hour he earned \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
   - For 4 hours, he earned \(7.50 \times 4 = 30\) dollars.

2. For the next 2 hours:
   - Patrick sold 10 cups each hour.
   - Each cup was sold for $0.60.
   - So, each hour he earned \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
   - For 2 hours, he earned \(6.00 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

3. Now, let's add the earnings from both periods:
   - Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

So, the total money Patrick earned is \(42\) dollars.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{42}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find out how many rotations happen in a month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles each month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

2. **Find out how many rotations happen in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the number of rotations in a year is:
     \[
     145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

3. **Find out how many years the tire can last:**
   - Each tire can rotate 10,440,000 times.
   - So, the number of years the tire can last is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

So, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The big bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
2. It says 2 pumps give 120 washes.
3. If Jackie uses 1 pump, she gets half the washes, so:
   \[
   \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ washes}
   \]
4. The cost per wash is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]
5. So, the cost for 60 washes (1 pump) is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 0.20 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]
6. To find the cost in cents:
   \[
   12 \text{ dollars} = 12 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents}
   \]

So, each pump costs \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy clothes. There is a 30% off sale, but the shirt he wants costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. Let's see if he can buy both.

First, we need to find out how much the shirt will cost after the discount. The shirt is $25 and there is a 30% discount. So, we calculate 30% of $25:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount, so they will still cost $35.

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe only has $50, so he does not have enough money to buy both the shirt and the shorts. He will not have any money left and will be short by $2.50.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day.
2. He will do this for 7 days.
3. So, the total number of dozens he will make in a week is:
   \[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

4. It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
5. So, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
   \[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter.
- So, the cost for Monica's street is \(150 \times 194 = 29,100\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- It also costs $194 per meter.
- So, the cost for Lewis' street is \(490 \times 194 = 95,060\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost:
- The difference is \(95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960\) dollars.

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

The correct answer is: $65,960."
"John is making a program to find cancer cells. He got money to work on it for 5 months, and it cost $100,000 each month for those 5 months. But it took 10 times longer, so he worked on it for 50 months in total. After the first 5 months, each month cost 50% more, so it was $150,000 each month.

For the first 5 months, the cost was:
\[ 5 \times 100,000 = 500,000 \]

For the next 5 months, the cost was:
\[ 5 \times 150,000 = 750,000 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ 500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000 \]

The total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip is 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. One pound is 16 ounces, so that's 16 ounces.

Now, let's add them up:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

So, \(6 + 8 + 16 = 30\) ounces.

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gary does laundry twice a week.
2. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
3. So, in one week, Gary uses \(2 \times 20 = 40\) gallons of water.
4. There are 52 weeks in a year, so in a year, Gary uses \(40 \times 52 = 2080\) gallons of water.
5. The cost of one gallon of water is $0.15.
6. So, the total cost for 2080 gallons of water is \(2080 \times 0.15 = 312\) dollars.

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

The answer is: \(\boxed{312}\)"
"Okay, let's add up what Scarlett bought:

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each, so \(2 \times 2.50 = 5.00\)
3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each, so \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\)
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each, so \(20 \times 0.50 = 10.00\)
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, let's add all these up:

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. In the second week, it grew to double its height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, making it \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"Prince is a butcher. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750 kg. We need to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

First, let's find out how much meat Prince sells in one day:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell all the meat from the bull."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the number of remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. There are 6 poles at each intersection.
3. So, at one intersection, the number of street lights is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).
4. There are 4 intersections, so the total number of street lights is \(24 \times 4 = 96\).
5. If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is \(96 - 20 = 76\).

So, the total number of functioning street lights is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this together!

We have two DVDs. The first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. It has already been played 356 times. So, the remaining times it can be played are:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times before it breaks. It has already been played 135 times. So, the remaining times it can be played are:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \]

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[ 1509 \]

"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, the baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, we need to multiply 9 by 3:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, the basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, we need to multiply 8 by 14:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{85}\)"

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - So, for three days, it pulled:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Remaining Four Days:**
   - For the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day.
   - So, it pulled:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - For four days, it pulled:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Adam's height is 40 inches. We need to know how tall he needs to be to ride the roller coaster. The roller coaster requires 4 feet.
2. First, we need to convert 40 inches to feet:
   \[
   40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Now, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Adam grows 2 inches per year. We need to convert this to feet:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}
   \]
5. Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years}

So, Adam needs 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. James sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000.
   - So, the total money he got from selling the cars is \(10 \times 25,000 = 250,000\).

2. The company paid 30% of the price to get the cars.
   - For each car, the cost to the company is \(25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500\).
   - For 10 cars, the total cost is \(10 \times 7,500 = 75,000\).

3. Now, we find out how much profit James made.
   - Profit is the total money from selling the cars minus the total cost to the company.
   - So, the profit is \(250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000\).

4. James gets 10% of the profit as his commission.
   - His commission is \(175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500\).

So, the amount James made is \(\boxed{17500}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

   \]
   So, 25 riders can stay on the wave.

2. Out of these 25 riders, 60% are women. This means 40% are men. So, we need to find 40% of 25:
   \[
   25 \times 0.40 = 10

   So, 10 men can stay on the wave.

The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
4. Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought some stamps with different designs. He bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. To find the total number of stamps, we add them all up: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."

Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. So, Tom is getting closer at a rate of:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is closing the gap:
\[ \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The answer is: 5 hours"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so:
   \[
   17 - 6 = 11
   \]
   Darren caught 11 fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
   \[
   11 + 3 = 14
   \]
   Tommy caught 14 fish.

So, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Manny paid $60 for 10 Karate classes.
2. His parents said if each class costs more than $10, they won't sign him up again.
3. We need to find out how many classes he can miss without the cost per class going over $10.

First, let's see how much each class costs if he doesn't miss any classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's see how many classes he can miss. If he misses 1 class, he will have 9 classes left:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{9} \approx 6.67 \text{ dollars} \]

If he misses 2 classes, he will have 8 classes left:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{8} = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

If he misses 3 classes, he will have 7 classes left:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ dollars} \]

If he misses 4 classes, he will have 6 classes left:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

If he misses 5 classes, he will have 5 classes left:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost per class will be more than $10 if he misses 5 or more classes. Therefore, he can miss up to 4 classes.

The answer is: \(\boxed{4}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jewel processes 50 customers each day.
2. Julie processes twice as many as Jewel, so Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers each day.
3. Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers each day.
4. Since they work 7 days a week, they process \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers in a week.

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[
\boxed{1050}
\]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much one apple costs.
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - So, one apple costs \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs.
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - So, one orange costs \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. Now, let's find out how much 5 apples cost.
   - One apple costs $1.30.
   - So, 5 apples cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. Let's find out how much 5 oranges cost.
   - One orange costs $1.10.
   - So, 5 oranges cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. Finally, let's add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
   - The total cost is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

So, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to know the volume of the hole first. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. 

To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:
\[ 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. So, to shovel 72 cubic feet, it will take:
\[ 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:
\[ \boxed{216} \text{ seconds} \]"
"Okay, let's add up the costs for Bill's new truck:

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab, so that's $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so that's $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add all these together:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (light package) = $43,500.

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

The correct answer is: $43,500."
"Tim got a new job with a raise. His old job paid him $20,000 a month. Now, he gets a 5% raise, so we need to add 5% of $20,000 to his old salary.

5% of $20,000 is:
\[ 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new salary is:
\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

But he also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of $20,000 is:
\[ 20000 \div 2 = 10000 \]

So, his new monthly salary with the bonus is:
\[ 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
\[ 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\$372000\) in a year. The correct answer is: \(\boxed{372000}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - So, the total cost for suits is \( 10 \times 750 = 7500 \) dollars.

2. **Dress Pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for dress pants is \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

3. **Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - So, the total cost for dress shirts is \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs: \( 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of everything is \( \boxed{10800} \) dollars."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. The first website makes 20 news articles every day. February has 28 days, so we need to find out how many articles they make in February.
   - \(20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles}\)

2. The second website makes 10 business news articles every day. Again, February has 28 days, so we need to find out how many articles they make in February.
   - \(10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles}\)

3. Now, we add the articles from both websites to find the total number of articles in February.
   - \(560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles}\)

So, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is \(840\).

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{840}\)"
"Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older, so she is 64. Their son is half as old as his mom, so he is 32. His wife is 3 years younger than him, so she is 29.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. We know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions.
2. Each portion is 2 kilograms.
3. So, to find out how much flour is in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:
   \[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]
4. Now, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since one bag has 16 kilograms, three bags will have:
   \[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is \(\boxed{48}\) kilograms."
"Alisa biked 12 miles every hour and she biked for 4.5 hours. So, we need to multiply 12 by 4.5 to find out how many miles she biked:
\[ 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Stanley biked 10 miles every hour and he biked for 2.5 hours. So, we need to multiply 10 by 2.5 to find out how many miles he biked:
\[ 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total:
\[ 54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
\[ 79 \text{ miles} \]

The correct answer is: 79 miles."
"Bill is digging a well. He can dig 4 feet in one hour through soil. For clay, he digs half as fast, so that's 2 feet in one hour.

First, let's find out how long it takes to dig through the soil:
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- At 4 feet per hour, it will take \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's find out how long it takes to dig through the clay:
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- At 2 feet per hour, it will take \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we add the time for soil and clay:
- Total time = 6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

First, let's count the total number of people:
- Howie
- His teacher
- 25 classmates

So, the total number of people is:
1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). So, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
27 people × 2 cupcakes per person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Fishio got 2000 likes at first.
2. After 3 weeks, she got 70 times more likes than the first 2000. So, we need to multiply 2000 by 70:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she got 20000 more likes. So, we add 20000 to 140000:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000

So, the total number of likes is 160000. The correct answer is:

\boxed{160000}"
"Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

The next day, the price of pomegranates shot to $30 each. So, the initial cost for Sheila is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Red Hats Sales:**
   - Ariadne sold red hats for $400 in the first month.

2. **Green Hats Sales:**
   - The money from red hats is half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, the money from green hats is \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

3. **Total Sales in the First Month:**
   - Total sales = Red hats + Green hats
   - Total sales = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

4. **Sales in the Second Month:**
   - In the second month, she made \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month.
   - So, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

5. **Total Sales in Two Months:**
   - Total sales in two months = First month + Second month
   - Total sales in two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\) dollars."
"James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's add up the cost:
- First hour: $15
- Next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

So, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

James paid \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Sally's bank account went from $200 to $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 more in her account this week. Her weekly wage should be $300, but she only has $220. So, the money that was taken away from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"Lori needs to make deviled eggs for her party. Each guest will eat 3 halves of a deviled egg, and she is inviting 16 guests.

First, we need to find out how many halves of deviled eggs she needs:
\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs she needs. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 halves:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs she needs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Lori will need \(\boxed{2}\) dozens of eggs."
"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She has already written 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has left, we can do the math like this:

The book will be finished in 20 days. Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

The correct answer is: 10 days before the deadline."
"James buys a plane for $150,000. He pays $5,000 a month to rent a hanger and $10,000 a month for fuel. 

First, we need to find out how much he pays each month for the hanger and fuel together:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month.

Now, we need to find out how much he pays in a year:
$15,000 per month × 12 months = $180,000 per year.

So, the total cost for the first year is:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000.

The final answer is $330,000."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - So, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - So, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 1/2 pound of almonds costs. Since 1 pound of almonds costs $10, 1/2 pound will cost:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs. Since 1 pound of walnuts costs $15, 1/3 pound will cost:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds. Since 1 pound of almonds costs $10, 1/5 pound will cost:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

We already know that 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $5.

So, the total cost for the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- There are 20 heads in total.
- There are 70 legs in total.

Let's use simple math:
1. If we have 20 heads, that means we have 20 animals in total (sheep + geese).
2. Now, let's think about the legs. If all 20 animals were geese, they would have 2 legs each, so that would be 20 geese * 2 legs = 40 legs. But we know there are 70 legs in total, so there must be more legs from sheep.
3. If we take away the 40 legs from geese, we have 70 - 40 = 30 legs left for sheep.
4. Since each sheep has 4 legs, we can find the number of sheep by dividing the remaining legs by 4. So, 30 legs / 4 legs per sheep = 7.5. But we can't have half a sheep, so we need to adjust.
5. Let's say we have \( S \) sheep and \( G \) geese. We know \( S + G = 20 \) and \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).
6. If we solve these, we find that \( S = 15 \) and \( G = 5 \).

So, the number of sheep is 15.

The answer is: \(\boxed{15}\)"
"Roger wants to buy coffee and a donut. The coffee he likes is not available, so he has to buy a more expensive brand. The normal coffee costs $5 per pound, but the new one costs 20% more.

To find out how much the new coffee costs, we need to add 20% of $5 to $5. 

20% of $5 is:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the new coffee costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger needs coffee for a week, and he uses 1 pound of coffee each day. So, he needs:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The cost for 7 pounds of the new coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. 

So, the total cost is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for everything is:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's find out how many hours he spends in the class over 6 weeks:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. So, we calculate:
   \[
   0.60 \times 150 = 90
   \]
   So, there are 90 history teachers.

2. Next, we need to find out how many math teachers there are. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
   \[
   150 - 90 = 60
   \]
   So, there are 60 math teachers.

3. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. So, to find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep together, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:
   \[
   60 \times 6 = 360

So, the math teachers collectively sleep for 360 hours in one day. The correct answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we know Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Now, we add up all their money:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. If they share the money equally, each person gets:
   \[
   \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}

"To make 16 muffins, Svetlana needs to use the following amounts of dry ingredients:

- Flour: Each muffin needs 5 tablespoons, so for 16 muffins, she needs \(16 \times 5 = 80\) tablespoons.
- Sugar: Each muffin needs 3 tablespoons, so for 16 muffins, she needs \(16 \times 3 = 48\) tablespoons.
- Salt: Each muffin needs 0.25 tablespoons, so for 16 muffins, she needs \(16 \times 0.25 = 4\) tablespoons.

Now, we add up all the tablespoons:
- Total tablespoons = \(80 + 48 + 4 = 132\).

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The correct answer is: 132."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, we need to find out how much candy they have in total. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, we add these together:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, they want to share this candy equally. There are 3 people, so we divide the total candy by 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them will have 4 pounds of candy.

The answer is: 4 pounds."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Adam spent on the candies.

For type A candies:
- Adam bought 7 candies.
- Each candy costs $0.5.
- So, 7 candies cost \(7 \times 0.5 = 3.5\) dollars.

For type B candies:
- Adam bought 10 candies.
- Each candy costs $0.75.
- So, 10 candies cost \(10 \times 0.75 = 7.5\) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total amount Adam spent:
- Total cost = \(3.5 + 7.5 = 11\) dollars.

Adam paid $15 to the cashier. So, the change he got is:
- Change = \(15 - 11 = 4\) dollars.

So, the change Adam got is \(\boxed{4}\) dollars."
"Christina recorded her mood for 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Her first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Let's count the good days:
- First 8 days were good.
- Next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, so 2 more good days.

So, the total good days are:
8 (first 8 days) + 2 (next 3 days) = 10 good days.

Since she had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 - 10 = 2.

The answer is 2."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We know that Janey has 21 books. The problem says that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, if we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey has \( 2S + 3 \) books.

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is now. It's 20 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we can find out how many inches it is now:
   \[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

2. We want the bamboo to be 600 inches tall. So, we need to find out how much more it needs to grow:
   \[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

3. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide:
   \[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches tall.

The answer is: \(\boxed{12}\)"
"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy.

1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12.
3. James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. So, the number of dogs is now 12 * 2 = 24.
4. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) = 20.

**Final Answer: 20**"

2. Now, we need to add Jack's weight. Jack also weighs 80 kg, so:
   \[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

3. The elevator can only hold 700 kg. So, we need to see how much more they have than the limit:
   \[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg.

The answer is: 20 kg"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. Shania is making her dress longer. She adds 50% of the original length and then 20 cm more.
2. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm.

- When she adds 50% of the original length, it becomes \( x + 0.5x \).
- Then she adds 20 cm more, so the total length is \( x + 0.5x + 20 \).

We know this total length is 140 cm, so we can write:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]
Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The answer is: \(\boxed{80}\)"

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets.
2. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
3. The combined ages of one twin and one triplet is 44.

Let's use simple numbers to understand this better:
- Let's say the age of the triplet is \( T \).
- The age of the twin is \( T + 7 \).

Now, we know that:
\[ T + (T + 7) = 44 \]

This means:
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation:
\[ 2T = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = \frac{37}{2} \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

So, the age of the triplet is 18.5 years.

Now, the age of the twin is:
\[ T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. The answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. So, for 10 lollipops, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Next, we know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Now, for 10 candies, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings in 10 years:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings in 10 years:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total number of coins they have together is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
   \[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

2. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is \( x \) dollars. So, the heartworm check is:
   \[ 0.6x \]

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
   \[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
   \[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
   \[ 0.4x = 40 \]
   \[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
   \[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - So, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - So, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's count the squares step by step:

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to 14:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to 18:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from 24:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, let's add all the squares together:
\[
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know there are 8 high chairs.
2. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, we multiply 8 by 5:
   \[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
   This means there are 40 regular chairs.
3. Now, we add the high chairs and regular chairs to find out how many chairs are there in total:
   \[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]
   So, there are 48 chairs in total.
4. For the function, we need chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies. So, we add these numbers:
   \[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]
   This means we need 57 chairs in total.
5. To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs we already have from the number of chairs needed:
   \[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many bucks there are. We know that 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks.
   - 50 percent is the same as 50 out of 100, which is 0.5.
   - So, we multiply 50 (the total number of deer) by 0.5 (which is 50 percent).
   - \(50 \times 0.5 = 25\).
   - So, there are 25 bucks.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 point bucks. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points.
   - 20 percent is the same as 20 out of 100, which is 0.2.
   - So, we multiply 25 (the number of bucks) by 0.2 (which is 20 percent).
   - \(25 \times 0.2 = 5\).
   - So, there are 5 8 point bucks.

The answer is 5."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. So, we need to find 30% of 50 and add it to 50:
   - 30% of 50 = 0.30 × 50 = 15
   - Betty's points = 50 + 15 = 65

3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we need to subtract 30 from Betty's points:
   - Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35

4. Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. So, we need to multiply Tom's points by 3:
   - Marta's points = 3 × 35 = 105

Now, let's add up all the points:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Marta: 105 points

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, the class is missing:
- 400 - 255 = 145 points

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

So, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. Greta's paycheck is $2400.
2. She puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. So, we need to find 50% of $2400:
   \[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]
   So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.
3. She uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. So, we need to find 20% of $2400:
   \[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]
   So, she uses $480 for her car payment.
4. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left. We subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Martha's cat can run 15 feet every second. The turtle is much slower. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, so we need to find out how fast the turtle can go.

If the cat is 5 times faster, then the turtle's speed is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle goes 3 feet every second, in 40 seconds, it will go:
\[ 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The answer is: \(\boxed{120}\)"
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to raise money, we first need to know how much more they need to reach their goal. They want to raise $6300 and have already raised $2100. So, we subtract:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

This means they need to raise $4200 more. We know they raised $2100 in 3 hours, so they raise:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

This means they raise $700 every hour. To find out how many more hours they need, we divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to raise money for 6 more hours. Adding the 3 hours they already worked, the total hours they need to work is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to work is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The city uses 40% of the water from the river.
2. Out of that 40%, 80% is used for making things (industrial purposes).
3. To find out how much is not used for making things, we need to subtract the industrial part from the total city usage.

First, we find out how much water is used for industrial purposes:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 32\% \]

Now, we subtract the industrial part from the total city usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's water for things other than making things (non-industrial purposes).

The answer is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would be:
   \[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

2. Now, if Alex charges $12 per day, we need to find out how much she charges for 14 days. We do this by multiplying the number of days by the daily charge:
   \[ 14 \times 12 = 168 \]

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{168}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) quarts.

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \) quarts.

3. **Total Quarts in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours: \( 50 \times 48 = 2400 \) quarts.
   - For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours: \( 12.5 \times 48 = 600 \) quarts.
   - Total quarts: \( 2400 + 600 = 3000 \) quarts.

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is \( \boxed{3000} \)."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Marcus spent on each type of item:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each
  \[
  5 \times 3 = 15
  \]
  So, croissants cost $15.00.

- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each
  \[
  4 \times 2.50 = 10
  \]
  So, cinnamon rolls cost $10.00.

- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12
  \]
  So, mini quiches cost $12.00.

- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each
  \[
  13 \times 1 = 13
  \]
  So, blueberry muffins cost $13.00.

Now, let's add all these amounts together to find the total before the discount:
\[
15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50
\]
So, the total before the discount is $50.00.

Next, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off. This means he only pays 90% of the total. So, we need to find 90% of $50.00:
\[
50 \times 0.90 = 45
\]
So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this together! Erin has $6.00 and the ice cream parlor is giving a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's see how much 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free) cost:
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops. Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer:**
6"
"Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces in two weeks.

Now, let's see how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces in two weeks.

Next, we find out how much candy each has left:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- So, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"Mr. Boarden is making his bathroom look nice. He needs 24 tiles for each square foot. His bathroom is 36 square feet, but he only wants to cover two-thirds of it. 

First, we find out how much area he wants to cover:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, for each square foot, he needs 24 tiles. So for 24 square feet, he needs:
\[ 24 \times 24 = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 tiles. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{576} \]"
"James went to pick blueberries. It cost him $20 to go and then $1.5 for each pound. He picked 30 pounds. 

First, we need to find out how much it cost him to pick 30 pounds:
- Cost to go picking: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Pounds picked: 30

So, the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]

Now, we add the cost to go picking:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost him to buy 30 pounds of blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
- Pounds picked: 30

So, the cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]

Now, we find out how much he saved:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The company planned to buy each computer for $700.
2. The price went up by 10%. To find out how much 10% of $700 is, we do:
   \[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]
3. So, the new price of each computer is:
   \[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]
4. Now, they want to buy 500 computers at this new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:
   \[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"Okay, let's count the calories in John's omelet step by step.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - So, 6 eggs have \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - So, 2 ounces of cheese have \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses 2 ounces of ham.
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - So, 2 ounces of ham have \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, let's add all the calories together:
- Total calories = 450 (from eggs) + 240 (from cheese) + 80 (from ham) = 770 calories.

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is 770.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total people who applied**: 100.
2. **People who get interviews**: 30% of 100.
   - 30% means 30 out of 100, so 30 people get interviews.
3. **People who get job offers**: 20% of 30.
   - 20% of 30 is 6 people.
4. **People who accept the job**: 1 out of 3 of the 6 people.
   - 1 out of 3 means we divide 6 by 3, which is 2 people.

So, the number of people who accept the job is 2.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step!

1. Helga taps her right foot 300 times per minute when her arms are down.
2. She taps her left foot 250 times per minute when her arms are down.
3. When her arms are up, she taps each foot 200 times per minute.

Now, let's calculate the taps:

- For 3 minutes with her arms down:
  - Right foot: \(300 \times 3 = 900\) taps
  - Left foot: \(250 \times 3 = 750\) taps

- For 2 minutes with her arms up:
  - Right foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps
  - Left foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps

Now, let's add them up:

- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the right and left foot taps together:

- Total taps: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450\)

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Ron wants to fix the pothole in front of his house. If he doesn't fix it, his car might get damaged for $450. But if he fixes it himself, the city will fine him $120 and he needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that cost $25 each.

First, let's find out how much the asphalt will cost:
3 buckets × $25 per bucket = $75

Now, let's add the fine:
$75 + $120 = $195

So, if Ron fixes the pothole, it will cost him $195. But if he doesn't fix it, his car might get damaged for $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of the damage:
$450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The correct answer is: $255."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The restaurant has 170 normal chairs.
2. They sent 20 normal chairs for repair.
3. So, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next:

1. The restaurant has 23 baby chairs.
2. They sent 13 baby chairs for repair.
3. So, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, let's add the remaining chairs:

1. Normal chairs left: 150
2. Baby chairs left: 10
3. Total chairs left: \(150 + 10 = 160\)

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many slices each pizza has. Each pizza has 12 slices.
2. There are 5 friends, so the total number of slices is:
   \[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

3. Bryce and his two friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. So, each of them ate:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
   Since there are 3 friends, they ate:
   \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

4. The other two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, each of them ate:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
   Since there are 2 friends, they ate:
   \[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

5. Now, we add the slices eaten by all friends:
   \[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

6. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total slices:
   \[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat 9 sausages.

3. Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. We add the times and divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the average time they take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to know how long one of Topher's shoes is in inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Now, add the 4 inches:

\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

The problem says that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. If we let \( x \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches, then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many windows are in the students' cars:
   - There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\).

2. Now, Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
   - A quarter means one out of four, so we divide 256 by 4.
   - \(256 \div 4 = 64\).
   - So, Hannah smashes 64 windows from the students' cars.

3. Next, we need to find out how many windows are in the teachers' cars:
   - There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\).

4. Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
   - Three-quarters means three out of four, so we multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4.
   - \(64 \times \frac{3}{4} = 48\).
   - So, Hannah smashes 48 windows from the teachers' cars.

5. Finally, we add the windows smashed from both students' and teachers' cars:
   - \(64 + 48 = 112\).

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is 112.

The answer is: \(\boxed{112}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this together!

First, we need to count all the blue spools. We have:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

So, the total number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find out the total number of all spools. We have:
- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

So, the total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of the spools are blue.

The final answer is:
40%"

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5.
2. We also know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, a half-gallon jar costs:
   \[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much 10 gallon jars cost. Since each gallon jar costs $5, 10 gallon jars will cost:
   \[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Next, we need to find out how much 16 half-gallon jars cost. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, 16 half-gallon jars will cost:
   \[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

5. Finally, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money spent:
   \[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 50 students in total.
2. 10 students like to bake.
3. 5 students like to play basketball.
4. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) students.

Now, let's add up the students who like baking, playing basketball, and playing music:
\[10 \, (\text{baking}) + 5 \, (\text{basketball}) + 10 \, (\text{music}) = 25\]

To find out how many students like to play video games, we subtract the number of students who like the other activities from the total number of students:
\[50 - 25 = 25\]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard. He scared away 1/3 of them, which means he scared away:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, after scaring away 4 birds, there were:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Then, 20 more birds came to join the ones that were left. So, the total number of birds now is:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final answer is 28."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Total Students in Both Classes:**
   - There are 80 students in total.
   - Since there are two classes, we divide the total number of students by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Number of Girls in Each Class:**
   - 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - To find the number of girls, we calculate 40% of 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Number of Boys in Each Class:**
   - The total number of students in each class is 40.
   - The number of boys is the total number of students minus the number of girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

So, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

First, we find out how much he saves on each tomato:
$0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1

Then, we find out how much he saves each day:
$0.1 * 500 = $50

There are 7 days in a week, so we find out how much he saves in a week:
$50 * 7 = $350

So, the vendor saves $350 a week.

The correct answer is: $350."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, Cal has:
   \[ 2 \times 56 = 112 \text{ marbles} \]
4. Now, we add Carl's and Cal's marbles together:
   \[ 224 + 112 = 336 \text{ marbles} \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{336}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have 54 students.
2. We need to make 6 groups of equal size.
3. So, we divide 54 by 6:
   \[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]
   This means each group will have 9 students.

4. Now, we need to make 12 groups.
5. We still have 54 students, so we divide 54 by 12:
   \[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]
   This means each group would have 4.5 students, but we can't have half a student in a group.

6. We already have 6 groups.
7. To make 12 groups, we need:
   \[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]
   So, we need 6 more groups.

"Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, she rents 60 chairs each day. On weekends, she rents 100 chairs each day. We need to find out how many chairs she will rent in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
- Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
- So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
- Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
- So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

Now, let's find the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

Finally, let's find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

So, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Gunther started with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold took half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24

   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Arnold then took 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}

"Okay, let's solve this together!

Jenna and her 4 roommates have to pay for the electricity bill. The bill is $100 each month. There are 5 people in total.

First, we need to find out how much each person pays every month. We do this by dividing the total bill by the number of people:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]
So, each person pays $20 every month.

Now, we need to find out how much each person pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]
So, each person pays $240 in a year.

The answer is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for a party. 

First, let's count the glasses and plates:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 × 12 = 48 plates

When the items were returned, some were broken:
- 10 glasses were broken
- 6 plates were broken

Now, let's find out how many glasses and plates are left:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

So, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, she trades \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers. Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons from the remaining large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27
- Large buttons: 20
- Small buttons from large stickers: 60

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107

So, the answer is 107 buttons."

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know there are 33 people on the council.
2. The number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
3. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so it's \( 2x \).
4. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes against and the votes in favor, which is \( x + 2x = 33 \).
5. This simplifies to \( 3x = 33 \).
6. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3: \( x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \).
7. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), so it's \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Okay, let's count the shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Extra-Small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-Large: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

1. First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
   - 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

2. Now, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
   - 50 people - 10 people = 40 people

3. Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
   - 60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

4. Finally, we need to find out how many people think horse #12 will win. We do this by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
   - 50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 is one third of the Pomeranians, then to find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply 6 by 3:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, there are 18 Pomeranians in total.

3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of Jana's puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the three houses together need 250 cases of shingles. Let's say the first house needs \( x \) cases. 

The second house needs twice as much as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases. 

The third house needs twice as much as the first house too, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

So, the total number of cases is:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases, which is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

First, let's find 45% of 200:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, he has:
200 + 90 = 290 pears

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of pears and bananas:
290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits

So, George has 490 fruits in total.

   - So, the total wheels for motorcycles = \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

3. **Total Wheels Needed:**
   - Total wheels needed = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles
   - Total wheels needed = \( 228 + 146 = 374 \) wheels.

4. **Wheels Left:**
   - Henry has 650 wheels.
   - Wheels left = wheels in the box - total wheels needed
   - Wheels left = \( 650 - 374 = 276 \) wheels.

So, the number of wheels that will be left is:
\[
276

"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you can follow these simple steps:

1. First, find out how much the discount is. You do this by multiplying $1000 by 20% (which is the same as 20 out of 100):
   \[
   1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 200
   \]
   So, the discount is $200.

2. Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

So, after the discount, you have to pay $800.

The correct answer is: $800."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ movies in series}
   \]
3. Each series movie costs $6, so:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The remaining movies are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies}
   \]
6. Each older movie costs $5, so:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]
7. The rest are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies}
   \]
8. Each normal movie costs $10, so:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
9. The total cost is:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is \(\boxed{4400}\) dollars."
"Winston picked some fruit from the orchard. He picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums, and 6 pounds of apricots. The prices are:
- Peaches: $2.00 per pound
- Plums: $1.00 per pound
- Apricots: $3.00 per pound

Let's calculate how much he spent on each type of fruit:
- For peaches: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00\)
- For plums: \(8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00\)
- For apricots: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00\)

Now, let's add up the costs:
\[ \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00 \]

So, Winston spent \(\$38.00\) on fruit.

The final answer is: \(\$38.00\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Driving Time and Speed:**
   - They drove for 4.5 hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - So, the distance they drove is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

2. **Hiking Time and Speed:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was half of their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \div 2 = 25\) miles per hour.
   - So, their hiking speed is \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.
   - The distance they hiked is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 + 30 = 255\) miles.

So, the total distance to the vacation spot is \(\boxed{255}\) miles."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
3. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now, let's look at the points:
- For each enemy, they get 10 points.
- For each berry, they get 5 points.
- For each second left on the timer, they get 30 points.

If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, she gets \(8 \times 10 = 80\) more points.
If Ava collects 3 more berries, she gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) more points.
If Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, she gets \(4 \times 30 = 120\) fewer points.

So, the total extra points Ava gets from jumping on more enemies and collecting more berries is:
\[80 + 15 = 95\]

Since she finishes 4 seconds slower, she loses 120 points. But we need to find the difference in their scores, so we add the extra points she gets:
\[95 - 120 = -25\]

But since we are looking for the difference in their scores, and Ava ends up with more points, the difference is:
\[215\]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of $64. Two of the pizzas cost $30 together.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:
\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much, so:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
For 2 days, that's:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

So, in total, they ride:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

The answer is 27 rides a week."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He bought some more fish and now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say Bob bought \(O\) orange fish and \(W\) white fish. So, after buying, he has \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish.

The problem says he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can write this as:
\[3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)\]

Now, let's solve this:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17:
\[O + W = 17\]

Now, let's solve these two equations together. From the second equation, we can say:
\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]
\[17 - 3W = 5\]
\[17 - 5 = 3W\]
\[12 = 3W\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The correct answer is:
\[\boxed{4}\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance Andy Travels:**
   - One way to work: 5 miles
   - Round trip: 5 miles (to work) + 5 miles (back home) = 10 miles
   - Andy works 5 days a week, so he travels: 10 miles/day × 5 days = 50 miles/week

2. **Fuel Used:**
   - Andy's car uses 10 miles per gallon of gas
   - So, for 50 miles, he needs: 50 miles ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons

3. **Cost of Gas:**
   - Gas costs $3 per gallon
   - So, for 5 gallons, he spends: 5 gallons × $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is spending $15 per week on gas. The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Carrie got some money from her aunt. She got ten twenties and 140 quarters.

First, let's find out how much money she got from the twenties:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money she got from the quarters:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she got is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Carrie spent some of this money. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she spent is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

To find out how many fruits he gets, we need to do some simple math.

For tomatoes:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

For eggplants:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, Ricardo gets 142 fruits from his plants.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this together!

First, we know that Samwell's store sold a total of 40 TVs this week. Out of these, one-fourth are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs.

To find out how many smart TVs were sold:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
So, 10 smart TVs were sold.

To find out how many analog TVs were sold:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]
So, 5 analog TVs were sold.

Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[ 25 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"John is trying to raise money for a school trip. The trip costs $300, and the school will pay half of it. So, the school will pay $150. John has $50 saved up. 

To find out how much more John needs, we add what the school will pay and what John has:
\[ 150 + 50 = 200 \]

The total cost of the trip is $300, so we subtract what John and the school will pay from the total cost:
\[ 300 - 200 = 100 \]

So, John is missing $100. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Carson's house gets cold at night. During the day, it's 45 degrees, but at night, it's 33 degrees colder. So, we need to find out what the temperature is at night:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes in Carson's house might freeze if the temperature goes below 32 degrees. So, we need to make the temperature go up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature we need to make up is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood Carson burns makes the temperature go up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs he needs, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to keep the pipes from freezing."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be made from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:
   \[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]
   So, there are 10 groups.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
   This means 6 groups brought back seashells.

3. Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{12}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day.
2. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.
3. To find out how much money he makes each day, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
   \[ 10 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25 = \$2.50 \]
4. Now, we need to find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month. We multiply the daily amount by 30:
   \[ \$2.50 \times 30 = \$75.00 \]

So, the amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is \(\$75.00\).

The correct answer is: \(\$75.00\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jamie works 8 hours a day and gets $20 for each hour. So for 8 hours, she gets:
   \[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

2. On Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. That means she worked 3 extra hours (11 - 8 = 3).

3. For the extra hours, she gets 150% of her regular pay. So, 150% of $20 is:
   \[ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

4. For the 3 extra hours, she gets:
   \[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

5. Now, we add her regular pay and the extra pay to find the total:
   \[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"Okay, let's count the lions together!

1. There are 12 female lions.
2. The number of male lions is half of the female lions, so that's \(12 \div 2 = 6\) male lions.
3. There are 14 lion cubs.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[12 + 6 + 14 = 32\]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32.

The answer is: 32"
"Mike wants to buy jeans that are on sale for 25% off. The original price of the jeans is $40. 

First, we need to find out how much the discount is. To do this, we take 25% of $40:
\[ 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from $50:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The company hires 20 new workers every month.
2. They do this for 3 months, so the total new workers hired are:
   \[ 20 \text{ workers/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ workers} \]
3. The company already had 200 workers, so now they have:
   \[ 200 \text{ workers} + 60 \text{ workers} = 260 \text{ workers} \]
4. Each worker gets $4000 per month, so for 260 workers, the monthly cost is:
   \[ 260 \text{ workers} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/worker} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]
5. For 3 months, the total cost is:
   \[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its workers after 3 months is:

2. ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once:
   - 240 seconds × 1 = 240 seconds

3. Now, we add the times together:
   - 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds. The correct answer is:

540 seconds"
"Billy started with $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.50 per hour. Sally started with $10.50 per hour, which is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage.

Billy works 20 hours, so he earns:
\[ 20 \times 11.50 = 230 \text{ dollars} \]

Sally works 20 hours, so she earns:
\[ 20 \times 10.50 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy earns more than Sally by:
\[ 230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so:
   \[3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2 \text{ per loaf} = \$6\]

2. Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so:
   \[2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1 \text{ per bagel} = \$2\]

3. Now, we need to find out how much more the bread costs than the bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
   \[\$6 - \$2 = \$4\]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost \$4 more than 2 bagels.

\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"Okay, let's count the trees step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students there are:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \times 25 = 1000 \text{ students} \]
Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ teachers} \]
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:
\[ 120 \times 2 = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees:
\[ 1000 + 240 = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ \boxed{1240} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, let's count how many stuffed animals Bubbles already has:
- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

So, the total number of stuffed animals she has now is:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, Bubbles wants to buy some stuffed goats so that the goats make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's say she buys \( x \) goats. Then the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the goats to be 30% of all the stuffed animals, so:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris wants to play a game for 30 hours to get an achievement. She plays half an hour every day for 2 weeks and then 2 hours every day for a week.

First, let's see how many hours she plays in the first part:
- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
- If she plays half an hour each day, that's 0.5 hours per day.
- So, in 14 days, she plays \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's see how many hours she plays in the second part:
- She plays 2 hours every day for 7 days.
- So, in 7 days, she plays \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs 30 hours to get the achievement. So, the hours she still needs to play are:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in a race!

The first car is going 60 miles every hour, and the second car is going 70 miles every hour. We want to know how far apart they will be after 2 hours.

First, let's see how far the first car goes in 2 hours:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's see how far the second car goes in 2 hours:
\[ 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how far apart they are, we subtract the distance the first car went from the distance the second car went:
\[ 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"To find out how many students passed the test, we need to add up the number of students who passed in each grade and then divide by the total number of students.

1. **Third-graders:**
   - 340 out of 500 passed.
   
2. **Fourth-graders:**
   - 40 out of 100 passed.
   
3. **Fifth-graders:**
   - The pass rate for fifth graders is twice that of the fourth graders.
   - The fourth graders' pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%.
   - So, the fifth graders' pass rate is \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%.
   - The number of fifth-graders who passed is \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \).

4. **Total number of students who passed:**
   - Third-graders: 340
   - Fourth-graders: 40

There are 10 quarts of tea left, so the total amount of tea at the beginning was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To find out how many gallons this is, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, we divide the total quarts by 4:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150, but he only had 100. So, he needed more and ordered 100 more. Now, let's count how many candies he has in total:

100 (initial order) + 100 (second order) = 200 candies

Dale sold 150 candies, so we need to find out how many he still has to sell:

200 (total candies) - 150 (sold) = 50 candies

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies.

The answer is: \boxed{50}"
"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. Each month, the number of students doubles.

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find out how many more students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

**Answer: 310**"
"Felix made $105 by helping kids get things out of trees. He charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. To find out how many branches he climbed, we need to divide $105 by $0.25.

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 420 by 7.

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First, count the petals from the first set of flowers:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.

2. **Next, count the petals from the second set of flowers:**
   - She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.

3. **Then, count the petals from the third set of flowers:**
   - She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.

4. **Finally, count the petals from the fourth set of flowers:**
   - She picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

5. **Add all the petals together:**
   - Total petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

6. **Now, subtract the petals of the flowers she drops:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.
   - Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

7. **Subtract the lost petals from the total:**
   - Remaining petals: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

So, the total number of petals in the vase is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, so together they made:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows was 35. After using 18 and dropping 3, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left. If they share these 14 S'mores equally, each kid can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores. The answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Jack's Playing Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (which is 240 minutes), Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.

2. **Two Friends' Playing Time:**
   - Each of these friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), each of these friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - Since there are two friends, they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters in total.

3. **Better Friend's Playing Time:**
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Tanya makes a salt scrub and uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as citrus zest.

Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( z \) ounces. Then:
- The amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We can divide the whole equation by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \). From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This works because the total is 10 ounces.

So, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. Let's find out how much money he spent.

First, we calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- So, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- So, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the money John spent is \(\boxed{4500}\) dollars."
"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for his party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Let's add the cupcakes he already has: 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy. We do this by subtracting the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs: 63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The answer is: 15."
"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Robert has 20 cars, so Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. That means he sells:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. So, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The charity raised a total of $175,000.
2. $50,000 came from organizations.
3. So, the rest came from the students. We need to find out how much that is:
   \[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]
   So, the students raised $125,000 in total.

4. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount by the number of students:
   \[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

The answer is: \(\boxed{6250}\)"
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked for half of that time, which is 4 hours. So, the total time she walked over the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the total time in minutes by multiplying 12 by 60. 

\[12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say PJ has \(P\) cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: \(P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341\]
\[7P + 12 = 341\]
\[7P = 341 - 12\]
\[7P = 329\]
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, let's find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \(3 \times 47 = 141\) cards.
- Becca has \(141 + 12 = 153\) cards.

So, Becca has \(\boxed{153}\) cards."
"Cindy went to the park and found some eggs. She had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them up:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

So, the total number of eggs is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

"Milly needs to return a book that weighs 4 pounds and costs $32. The book needs to be sent 20 miles to a distribution center. The shipping company charges $0.35 for each pound and $0.08 for each mile. Amazon will only give back 75% of the book's price.

First, let's find out how much it costs to send the book:
- For the weight: \(4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40\)
- For the distance: \(20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60\)
- Total shipping cost: \(\$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00\)

Next, let's see how much money Milly will get back:
- Amazon will give back 75% of the book's price: \(32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00\)

Now, let's find out how much money Milly will lose:
- Original cost of the book: \$32

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
3. The base already includes 4 mirrors and 1 chandelier, so we need to add:
   - 2 more mirrors (6 - 4 = 2)
   - 1 more chandelier (2 - 1 = 1)
   - 10 more pictures (20 - 10 = 10)
4. Each additional item costs $15.00.
5. So, the cost for the additional items is:
   - 2 mirrors: 2 × $15 = $30.00
   - 1 chandelier: 1 × $15 = $15.00
   - 10 pictures: 10 × $15 = $150.00
6. Adding these together: $30 + $15 + $150 = $195.00
7. The total cost is the base cost plus the additional cost: $129 + $195 = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela is $324.00.

\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

After resting, he rides for another 6 hours at the same speed. So, the distance he covers in the second part is:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles} \]

To find the total distance he has traveled, we add the distances from both parts:
\[ 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. This means the distance they cover is the same as the distance four turtles need to cover.

Now, if one kangaroo takes the same speed, it would take one kangaroo 18 hours to cross the highway. Since the speed of a turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, one turtle would take twice as long to cross the same distance. So, one turtle would take:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since we have four turtles, and they are all traveling at the same speed (half the speed of a kangaroo), they will take the same amount of time as one turtle to cross the highway. Therefore, the four turtles will also take:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the answer is:

He wants to get 25 liters of milk each day. So, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk each day, he needs:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to get 25 liters of milk each day.

"Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, so he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys six squirt guns for $2 each, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount spent is:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money left is:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

To find out how many students are good at both, we need to subtract the students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{12}\)"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long each group takes on stage. Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, each group takes:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Now, the concert is 2 hours long. We need to change this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes

But there's a 10-minute break in the middle, so we need to subtract that:
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the time left by the time each group needs:
110 ÷ 10 = 11

So, the number of groups that can perform is:
11

The final answer is: 11"
"Brenda invested $300 in a scheme that gives her $225 every year. She gets this money for 3 years.

First, we need to find out how much money she gets each year:
\[ 300 \times \frac{3}{4} = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she gets in 3 years:
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the money she gets in 3 years to her original investment:
\[ 300 + 675 = 975 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars, so:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ white shirts have collars}
     \]
   - So, the number of white shirts without collars is:
     \[
     40 - 20 = 20
     \]

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

3. **Floral Shirts Without Buttons:**
   - So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
     \[
     50 - 20 = 30
     \]

4. **Difference:**
   - The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts without collars is 20.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     30 - 20 = 10

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs. Each tray can hold 30 eggs. The farmer has 900 eggs. So, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:
   \[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

2. Now, we need to find out how much money the farmer will earn. Each tray is sold for $2.5. So, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:
   \[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which is 20 goats.

So, in Farm X, he has:
55 - 10 = 45 goats left.

In Farm Y, he has:
45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

Now, let's add the goats left in both farms:
45 + 25 = 70 goats.

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70.

"James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. In a year, there are 12 months, so he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. **Green Food Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost is \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Red Food Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket, so each basket now costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost is \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Add the cost of the green food and the red food together.
   - So, \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The total amount you have to pay is \( \boxed{123} \) dollars."
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many rooms are in half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms, half of that is:
   \[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

2. Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, to clean 45 rooms, we multiply:
   \[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Now, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide:
   \[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

The answer is: 15 hours."
"In the first year, they will build 12 homes.
In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, so that's \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
By the end of the second year, they will have built \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes.
In the third year, they will build double the number of homes they have built by the end of the second year, so that's \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.
So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

The final answer is 144."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. You are three years younger than your brother. If your brother is \( B \) years old, then you are \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. You are two years older than your sister. If your sister is \( S \) years old, then \( S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. So, your mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87. So, \( (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

Now, let's add these up:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

So, your brother is 16 years old. Since you are three years younger than your brother:
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. **Day 0**: We start with 10 people infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others. So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people get infected. Now, the total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others. So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people get infected. Now, the total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others. So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people get infected. Now, the total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, so we need to multiply 40 by 20 to find out how much she got in total.

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we can do:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]
\[ 800 \div 10 = 80 \]
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \]

So, 10% of $800 is $80. Now, we subtract this from Rafaela's total to find out how much Julieta got:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta got $720 in tips.

To find out how much they got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips they got together is $1520.

The correct answer is: $1520."

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, she earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, she earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use simple numbers to understand this better:
- Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
- Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that the total number of books is 85:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, let's solve for \( F \):
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

2. **Manicure Cost:**
   The manicure cost is 1/4 of the hair treatment cost.
   \[
   \text{Manicure Cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Pedicure Cost:**
   The pedicure cost is 3/4 of the manicure cost.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure Cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   Now, we add up all the costs.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
   \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \(\boxed{575}\)."
"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. So, if Sarah sells the rope, she will get:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Sarah plans to use the money to buy a new rope, which costs $1.5 a meter. If she buys a 20-meter rope, it will cost:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah has:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can find out how old she is now by subtracting 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is 8 years old now.

Next, we want to know in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24. We can find this by subtracting her current age from 24:
\[ 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - So, each pack of bacon costs $10 ÷ 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - So, each packet of chicken costs $2 × 2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 × 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 × 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - So, each pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 × 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the money she has left is:
$65 - $60 = $5

So, the answer is \boxed{5}."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a simple math problem.

Elaina's final concert is 65 minutes long. But we know that 15 minutes of that time is for the encore. So, the time for the actual concert part is:

\[ 65 - 15 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, this 50 minutes is twice as long as her usual concerts. So, if we let \( x \) be the length of her usual concerts, then:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with.

First, let's add up the toys he gave away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
200 (original number of toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The answer is: \boxed{50}"
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas. On Wednesdays, they make another 125 chimichangas. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is 250 chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add them up:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The singer has 50 microphones.
2. 20% of the microphones won't fit. So, we need to find 20% of 50:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]
3. This means 10 microphones won't fit.
4. So, the number of microphones that can fit is:
   \[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
5. These 40 microphones can be paired up. Since each pair has 2 microphones:
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer can arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The answer is: \boxed{20}"
"Okay, let's count the birds Jerry sees:

1. Jerry sees 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \(\frac{2}{3}\) of 6 birds flying overhead. So, \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) birds are flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, \(3 \times 8 = 24\) birds are feeding.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[6 + 4 + 24 = 34\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She put these 50 cookies into 5 jars equally. So, each jar had 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals.
   - So, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

2. Joelle also has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals.
   - So, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

3. Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids.
   - The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: 15"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in total.
2. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]
   So, there are 25 indoor plants.
3. Now, we need to find out how many plants are left after taking away the indoor plants:
   \[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]
   So, there are 75 plants left.
4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]
   So, there are 50 outdoor plants.
5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. So, we calculate:
   \[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]
   So, there are 25 flowering plants.
6. To find out what percentage of the plants are flowering plants, we use:
   \[ \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

The answer is: \boxed{25\%}"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, if we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11, we get the speed of the thingamabob.
   \[
   \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. So, if we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5, we get the speed of the whirligig.
   \[
   \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

So, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
4. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods.
6. So, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
7. Ellen eats 2 carrots, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is:

"Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. He used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $12 an hour because they gave him a raise of $2.

First, let's find out how many hours he works in a week:
8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Now, let's find out how much he makes in a week:
$12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. She mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times (which is 3 times as many as Joe's), and Alba's lawn 5 times (which is 5 times as many as Joe's). Joe paid her $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

First, let's find out how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 time × $6 = $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times × $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 times × $6 = $30

Now, let's add up all the money she earned from mowing lawns:
$6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Tasha made $80 in total. To find out how much she made from selling lemonade, we subtract the money she earned from mowing lawns from the total money:
$80 - $54 = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from selling lemonade.

The answer is: $26"
"Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl is 16 kg heavier than Martin, so Carl's weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg. Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so Christian's weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg. Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so Harry's weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's add up the pages they read:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how much material is needed for one small mask. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, for one small mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]

Now, for 20 small masks, she needs:
\[ 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we need to know how much material is needed for one large mask. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, for one large mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]

Now, for 8 large masks, she needs:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, to find the total amount of material needed, we add the material for the small masks and the large masks:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, Jo needs 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks. The answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know Duncan is 60 years old now.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years old.
3. Four years ago, Adam was \(A - 4\) years old, where \(A\) is Adam's current age.
4. According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
5. Now, let's solve for \(A\):
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
   \[
   52 = 2A - 8
   \]
   \[
   52 + 8 = 2A

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there were 20 red balloons.

First, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since each red balloon got 2 pieces, and there are 20 red balloons, we can calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we know that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total. So, the pieces thrown at the yellow balloons would be:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna. So, to find out how many yellow balloons there are, we divide the pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3:

\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/balloon}} = 6 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

The final answer is:

So, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he works twice as much as Tuesday, so that's 2 times 5 hours, which is 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 hours minus 2 hours, which is 8 hours. 

To find out how many hours he works in all these three days, we add up the hours:
- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

So, 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is 23.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Cake**: The cake costs $11.
2. **Balloons**: They bought 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons). The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 12 balloons, it will be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Ice Cream**: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, and each tub costs $7. So, the total cost for ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of money and they combined it to buy these things, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each one had:

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has 3 times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has 1/3 the number of fish as gerbils, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{47}
\]"
"Abby eats 2 slices of bread each day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 4 slices each day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices each day. The loaf has 24 slices, so the loaf will last for 24 ÷ 6 = 4 days.

The loaf of bread will last for \boxed{4} days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old. By her 10th birthday, she would have been collecting shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months by multiplying 5 years by 12 months.

So, \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"Lana is making tea for her friends. She has 27 cups and puts them into 3 rows. So, in each row, she has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

This means each row has 9 cups. She makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. So, she splits the 9 cups in each row into chamomile and mint tea. Since they are equal, she has:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

The answer is: \(\boxed{4.5}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The sloth takes 4 hours for one trip down the tree, picking berries, and then climbing back up.
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips because \(8 \div 4 = 2\).
3. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total.
4. To find out how many berries the sloth picks per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips: \(24 \div 2 = 12\).

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The answer is: \(\boxed{12}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. The pool has 10,000 gallons, and the tank is filled with half of that. So, we do:
   \[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

2. Now, the tank is filled with 5000 gallons. They use 500 gallons of water from the tank each day. We need to find out how much water is left after 6 days. So, we do:
   \[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

3. To find out how much water is left in the tank, we subtract the water used from the total water in the tank:
   \[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Colby has $150 each month to spend on movies. He already spent some money on tickets, popcorn, and candy. Let's see how much he has left.

He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, he spent \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars on those tickets.

He saw 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, he spent \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars on those tickets.

He had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, he spent \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars on popcorn.

He had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, he spent \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars on candy.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby started with $150, so his remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday. He wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The answer is: \(\boxed{1}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
2. A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal one, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \div 3 = 200 \) calories.
3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

4. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
5. A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal one, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \div 3 = 150 \) calories.
6. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

7. Now, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
   - Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is 85000.

The final answer is: 85000"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Monday**: Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. **Tuesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
3. **Wednesday**: Again, twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
4. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.
5. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add them up:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Adding these together:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

There are 5 days from Monday to Friday. To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days:
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"The bus travels 60 miles every hour. If it travels for 5 hours, it will go:
60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

The car travels 30 miles every hour. If it travels for 8 hours, it will go:
30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The correct answer is: 60 miles."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to add up all the toys Sophie has except for the bouncy balls:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

So, we add these numbers:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Now, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from 62:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's use simple numbers to understand this better.

If Jean is 20 years old, then:
- Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.
- Peter's age is 30 + 20 = 50 years old.

Now, let's check if the total age is 100:
- Jean = 20
- Paul = 30
- Peter = 50

20 + 30 + 50 = 100

So, Peter is 50 years old.

The answer is: \boxed{50}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, for her 4 friends, she gave:
   \[4 \times 2 = 8\] balloons.

2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.

3. So, the total number of balloons Maria gave out at the start is:
   \[8 + 1 = 9\] balloons.

4. Then, Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by her mom is:
   \[5 \times 3 = 15\] balloons.

5. Now, we add the balloons given by Maria and her mom to find the total number of balloons:
   \[9 + 15 = 24\] balloons.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total.
2. 10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
3. They already have 10 boxes, so the total is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.
4. Each table can hold 2 boxes, so we need \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables in total.
5. They already have 15 tables, so they need \(30 - 15 = 15\) more tables.

So, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how far Zoey's seeds travel in total.
   - Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed travels 10 feet.
   - So, Zoey's total distance is \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

2. Next, we need to find out how far Sydney's seeds travel in total.
   - Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed travels 12 feet.
   - So, Sydney's total distance is \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

3. Now, we add both distances to get the total distance spat by both.
   - Total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

4. To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are two people).
   - Average distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

So, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"Fern is trying to decide between two machines that make widgets. One machine, the Widgeteer 3000, makes 60 widgets every hour. The other machine, the WidgetMaster 9000, makes 45 widgets every hour. Each widget sells for $6.

First, let's see how many widgets each machine makes in a month. A month has 30 days, and the machines run 24 hours a day.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30
- Total widgets per month = 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30
- Total widgets per month = 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's see how much money Fern can make from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000.

The correct answer is: $64,800."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cameron stays at the hotel from 5 pm to 10 am the next day. That's 17 hours in total.
2. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.
3. For the extra hours, it charges 70 pesos per hour.

First, we need to find out how many extra hours Cameron stays:
\[ 17 \text{ hours} - 12 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ extra hours} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the extra hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we add the cost for the first 12 hours and the extra hours:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron paid for a full 24-hour stay, it would cost:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

To find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of his stay from the full 24-hour cost:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

So, Cameron saves 250 pesos.

The answer is: \boxed{250}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how much hay each sheep needs. The problem says each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
Then, we subtract 3 pounds:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we need to find out how much hay all the goats need. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how much hay all the sheep need. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours.
   - So, he earned \(50 \times 6 = 300\) dollars.

2. He spends 50 dollars on gas.
   - So, he has \(300 - 50 = 250\) dollars left.

3. He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.
   - So, he has \(250 - 100 = 150\) dollars left.

4. He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.
   - So, he spends \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars on pencils.
   - Now he has \(150 - 50 = 100\) dollars left.

5. He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each.
   - So, he can buy \(\frac{100}{25} = 4\) pens.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word has 15 letters.
2. To find out how many letters Craig spelled, we multiply 20 by 15:
   \[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]
   So, Craig spelled 300 letters.

3. Craig's brother spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the 300 letters Craig spelled:
   \[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]
   So, Craig's brother spelled 350 letters.

4. To find the total number of letters they both spelled, we add the letters Craig spelled to the letters his brother spelled:
   \[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out together!

2. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
   \[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

3. To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:
   \[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house, plus $35 for each hour of work, and they use parts which cost extra.

For this job:
- Visit charge: $40
- Hours worked: 2.25 hours
- Parts cost: $60

First, we need to find out how much the labor cost. Since they charge $35 for each hour, for 2.25 hours, the labor cost is:
\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add all the costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75 for the job.

The correct answer is: $178.75."
"James buys 10 CDs. Each CD costs $15. He gets them for 40% off.

First, we find the total cost before the discount:
\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 = \$150 \]

Next, we calculate the discount:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:
\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 = \$200 \]

Since he sold the CDs for more than he paid, he didn't lose any money. He actually made some money.

So, the money James was out is:
\[ \boxed{\$0} \]"
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam costs $1.5.
   - So, \(6 \times 1.5 = 9\).

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato costs $2.
   - So, \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot costs $1.25.
   - So, \(4 \times 1.25 = 5\).

Now, let's add all the money together:
- From yams: $9
- From sweet potatoes: $20
- From carrots: $5

So, \(9 + 20 + 5 = 34\).

Jen will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars if she sells everything."
"James swims across a 20-mile lake. He swims 60% of the distance first.

1. **Calculate the distance he swims first:**
   - 60% of 20 miles = \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles

2. **Calculate the time to swim 12 miles:**
   - Speed = 2 miles per hour
   - Time = \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours

3. **Rest time:**
   - Rest time = half of the swimming time = \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - New speed = half of the original speed = \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \)

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   - Time = \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim first part = 6 hours
   - Rest time = 3 hours
   - Time to swim remaining part = 8 hours

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **New York Times:**
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - Cayley gets 10% commission.
   - 10% of $5 is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - He sold 6 copies, so the total commission is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - Cayley gets 8% commission.
   - 8% of $15 is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.

"Leo is 42 years old.

Answer: A"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points.
2. Bahati scored the most points.
3. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
4. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's say Bahati scored \( B \) points. Then:
- Azibo scored \( B - 20 \) points.
- Dinar scored \( B - 10 \) points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Let's solve this equation:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

So, Bahati scored 25 points. Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that 100 pages of paper are in 1 inch.
2. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
3. So, if 1 inch has 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will have:
   \[
   1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]
4. But remember, each piece of paper is printed on both sides. So, each piece of paper gives us 2 pages.
5. To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2:
   \[
   \frac{150}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

So, the book has 75 pages. The correct answer is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Vince can staple 30 reports in 15 minutes. He was stapling from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours.

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in 15 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The final answer is: 1800 reports."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. That's 480 minutes (8 hours × 60 minutes/hour).

One day, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes of sleepwalking.

From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes, which is 220 minutes.

So, the total time she was awake is 220 minutes (awake before getting out of bed) + 23 minutes (sleepwalking) = 243 minutes.

Her usual sleep time is 480 minutes, so the time she slept on her bed is 480 minutes - 243 minutes = 237 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{237}\)."
"Jonathan has 24 measuring cups because two dozen is 24.

He has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]
So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

He gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so he has:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]
So, he has 10 measuring spoons left.

Now, we add the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"The hospital can hold 1000 patients. Right now, 1/5 of the beds are full. So, 1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. That means 800 beds are empty.

Every day, 50 more patients come to the hospital. In 2 weeks (which is 14 days), 50 patients x 14 days = 700 new patients.

So, the total number of patients now is 200 (initially full) + 700 (new patients) = 900 patients.

The hospital has 1000 beds in total. If 900 beds are full, then the number of empty beds is 1000 - 900 = 100.

So, the answer is 100 empty beds."
"Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Now, two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

But the problem says one-third of the other emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:
   \[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:
   \[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The answer is: \boxed{45}"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in a primary school. Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly said Courtney was wrong and that number was 20% more than the real number of people.

If we take the real number of people as \( x \), then 48 is 120% of \( x \). This means:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we need to divide 48 by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

If we do the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{40}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. We know that Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. That means Jeffrey carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. So, Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) balls.

Now, let's add up all the balls:
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.

So, the total number of balls is \( 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \( \boxed{7} \)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so they added \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's add up the holes:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 6 holes (after filling in 2 holes)

So, by the end of the third day, they had \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\) holes.

At the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, they had 40 holes (because 4 times 10 is 40).

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.
2. So, together they got \(70 + 70 = 140\) corn chips.
3. Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. So, Collins got \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
4. Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got: \(70 + 70 + 85 = 225\).

So, the total number of corn chips is \(225\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"Jen needs to buy supplies for $400. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, we find 50% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \]

So, the tickets cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

The total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, let's say Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon.

Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught. So, Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.

Alex caught 5 more than what Stan caught. So, Alex caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they caught 339 Pokemon. So, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Now, let's simplify this:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Then, we divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, let's find out how many Pokemon Stan caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

The answer is: \(\boxed{147}\)"
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. The show has half as many episodes as there are minutes in one episode. So, we need to find out how many episodes there are:

\[

Now, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes and there are 10 episodes, we multiply:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
   - So, the distance is \(10 \times 30 = 300\) miles.

2. Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
   - So, the distance is \(2 \times 18 = 36\) miles.

3. Finally, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
   - So, the distance is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) miles.

Now, we need to find the total distance the bird flew south and subtract the distance flown north.

- Total distance flown south: \(300 + 110 = 410\) miles.
- Distance flown north: \(36\) miles.

So, the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 - 36 = 374\] miles.

The answer is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta made 12 brownies for herself. At her office party, she got 6 more brownies (which is half a dozen). When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 48 brownies (which is 4 dozen). During the surprise party, 18 brownies were eaten (which is one and a half dozen).

Let's add up all the brownies Greta had:
- 12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office party) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
- 66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The answer is: 48"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 6 years old. The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age is 30 years."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to do some simple math.

1. For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. For the 5 racquets with polyester string:
   \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. For the 4 racquets with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we add all the times together:
\(45 + 110 + 72 = 227\) minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

The final answer is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. That's 4 phones in total.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The next two phones are half price, so each costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding it all together:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

The answer is: \boxed{1800}"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players.
2. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we need to add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team.
3. Let's do the math: \(13 + 7 = 20\). So, Zeke's team has 20 players.
4. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team: \(20 + 13 = 33\).

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

The answer is: \(\boxed{33}\)"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to know the total length of the fence he is building. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, so we need to add these two numbers together and then double the result because a rectangle has two lengths and two widths.

So, we do:
\[ 15 + 10 = 25 \]
\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

This means the total length of the fence is 50 feet. Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the total length by 2:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{100}\)"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. That means she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 1/4 of 8 boxes, which is 2 boxes. That means she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 120."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. The USA has 50 states.
2. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half of the USA's states is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
4. So, India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.
5. Now, we add the states of both countries: \( 50 + 29 = 79 \).

So, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"Tyler wants to buy some books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. He has $14 saved. He earns $5 for every hour he works.

First, let's add up the cost of the books:
$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Now, let's see how much more money Tyler needs:
$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

The answer is: 5"

**Costs:**
- Gingerbread: $6 per box
- Apple pie: $15 per box

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes × $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes × $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes × $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes × $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. She will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days. 

First, we find out how much sunscreen she uses each day:
1 ounce/hour × 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

Next, we find out how much sunscreen she uses over 8 days:
4 ounces/day × 8 days = 32 ounces

Each bottle of sunscreen has 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:
32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack \boxed{4} bottles of sunscreen."
"The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper, so we need to find 40% of $100 and then subtract that from $100.

First, let's find 40% of $100:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

Now, subtract that from $100 to find the price of the red car:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160.

The correct answer is: $160."
"Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, that will be in 5 years. At that time:
- His dad will be 48 years old (because 24 x 2 = 48).
- His brother will be 12 years old (because 24 ÷ 2 = 12).

So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
And his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of their ages now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so that's 20 × 2 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add them up:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   \[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
   \[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up all the crawfish Joe caught:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

2. Now, we subtract the football players from the total number of students to find out how many are left:
   \[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

3. Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate:
   \[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

4. Finally, we add the number of football players and the cheerleaders/band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

\[ \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the boots is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Length of the Flower Bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long.
2. **Space Each Plant Needs**: Each plant needs 1 foot for itself and 1.5 feet for space between plants. So, each plant needs 2.5 feet.
3. **Number of Plants That Can Fit**: We divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we take the whole number, which is 44 plants.
4. **Plants Pat Already Has**: Pat already has 17 plants.
5. **Plants Pat Needs to Buy**: We subtract the plants Pat already has from the total number of plants needed:
   \[
   44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]
6. **Cost of Each Plant**: Each plant costs $6.
7. **Total Cost**: We multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - So, \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

2. Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - So, \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

3. Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines, and Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - So, \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

4. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - So, \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

5. Now, add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together.
   - Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

"Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute and sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp:
- She peels 6 shrimp per minute, so for 90 shrimp, it will take:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

To find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp:
- She sautés 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it will take:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Adding the time for both tasks:
- Peeling: 15 minutes
- Sautéing: 30 minutes
  \[
  15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
  \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer: 45 minutes**"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees each hour. So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. During this time, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 2 hours, the room warms up by:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ degrees}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet again when he was three times his dad's age when he saw it. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.
3. The comet comes back every 75 years. So, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.
4. If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw it the first time.

So, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Sure, let's count the checks Buford writes each month and then for the whole year.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes 1 check every month.
   - In a year, that's \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks.

2. **Gas bill**: He writes 1 check every month.
   - In a year, that's \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks.

3. **Church**: He writes 2 checks every month.
   - In a year, that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes 1 check every 3 months (quarterly).

1. The second plane flies to Poland 44 times.
2. The first plane flies twice as much as the second plane, so the first plane flies \(44 \times 2 = 88\) times.
3. Out of these 88 flights, 3/4 are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(88 \times \frac{3}{4} = 66\).
4. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\).
5. Since these 22 flights are split equally, the number of flights to France is \(22 \div 2 = 11\).

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so that's \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up all the howls:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

So, the total time is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To change seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $12. So, his parents gave him a total of $6 + $12 = $18. 

To find out how much Adam had to pay from his own money, we subtract the money his parents gave him from the total cost of the trousers. 

$30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The answer is \boxed{12}."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know the total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is \(3 + 4 = 7\).
4. This means the total age of Helene and Wilfred is \(20 - 7 = 13\).
5. Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\).
6. So, Helene's age is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
7. Now, we know Helene is 10 years old, and the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13.
8. Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(13 - 10 = 3\).

So, Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"Walter is collecting money for charity. He got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund. His lawyer will give three times the amount of money Walter got from everyone else.

First, let's add the money Walter got:
$500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Now, his lawyer will give three times this amount:
3 * $2000 = $6000

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6000.

The answer is: $6000"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:
   \[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

2. The bride gave half of these cookies to the church. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:
   \[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

3. Each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:
   \[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this together! Imagine we have a big watermelon, and we want to share it with a family of 6 people. There are 2 grown-ups and 4 kids. The grown-ups get a bigger piece than the kids. Each grown-up gets twice as much as each kid.

Let's say each kid gets 1 piece. Then each grown-up gets 2 pieces. So, if we count all the pieces, we have:
- 2 grown-ups × 2 pieces each = 4 pieces for grown-ups
- 4 kids × 1 piece each = 4 pieces for kids

So, we have a total of 4 (grown-ups) + 4 (kids) = 8 pieces.

Now, we want to know what part of the watermelon each grown-up gets. Since each grown-up gets 2 pieces and there are 8 pieces in total, each grown-up gets:
- 2 pieces ÷ 8 pieces = 1/4 of the watermelon

To find out what percentage this is, we do:
- 1/4 × 100 = 25%

So, each grown-up gets 25% of the watermelon.

The answer is: 25%"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic.
2. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time for appointments is:
   \[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]
   Convert 300 minutes to hours:
   \[ 300 \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]
3. He also has to do rounds for 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. So, the total time for rounds is:
   \[ 9 \times 20 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]
   Convert 180 minutes to hours:
   \[ 180 \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]
4. Now, add the time for appointments and rounds:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
5. Subtract the total time spent on appointments and rounds from the 9 hours he has at the clinic:
   \[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

The answer is: \boxed{1}"
"To make the cake ready by 5:00 pm, Jordan needs to finish all the steps before that time. Let's add up the time needed for each step:

- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 120 minutes (2 hours)
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:
\[ 10 + 120 + 30 + 20 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is the same as 3 hours. So, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

**2:00 pm**"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Lisa and Peter together sold 8 boxes of chocolate bars. (3.5 boxes from Lisa + 4.5 boxes from Peter = 8 boxes)
2. They sold 64 chocolate bars in total.
3. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

So, we do:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The dance studio costs $25 to rent the studio each time.
2. Each student costs $1.50 per session.
3. There are 10 students, so the cost for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
4. The total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
5. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.
6. There are about 4 weeks in a month, so the cost per month is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide 56 by 7:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find the number of female porcupines:**
   - Total porcupines = 50
   - Female porcupines = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30\)

2. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month:**
   - Each female gives birth to 4 babies.
   - So, 30 females will give birth to \(30 \times 4 = 120\) babies each month.

3. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, in a year, \(120 \times 12 = 1440\) babies will be born.

4. **Find the total number of porcupines after a year:**
   - Initial porcupines = 50
   - Babies born in a year = 1440
   - Total porcupines = \(50 + 1440 = 1490\)

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490.

**Final Answer:**
1490"
"To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the volume of the pool**: The pool is like a big box, so we use the formula for the volume of a box, which is length times width times depth.
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet
   - Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

2. **Convert the volume to gallons**: The pool company says to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   - Volume in gallons = 1400 × 5.9 = 8260 gallons

3. **Calculate the cost**: The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
   - Cost = 8260 gallons × $0.10/gallon = $826

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Okay, let's count the sticks together!

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so we add 5 to 9: \(9 + 5 = 14\). So, there are 14 blue sticks.
3. There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from 14: \(14 - 3 = 11\). So, there are 11 yellow sticks.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

So, \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\).

The total number of sticks is 34.

The answer is: 34."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Matteo traveled. Matteo was driving at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, we multiply:
\[ 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find out how far Shandy traveled. Shandy was driving at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, we multiply:
\[ 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do this by subtracting the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The answer is: 230 miles."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The school has 3000 students in total.
2. Half of the students are over 16 years old:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]
4. So, the number of female students over 16 is:
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]
5. The other half of the students are under 16 years old:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]
6. Half of the students under 16 are male:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]
7. So, the number of female students under 16 is:
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]
8. The total number of female students is:
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

So, the total number of female students is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank.
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B filled \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda filled.
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total for the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she filled on the first day.
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B filled \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she filled on the first day.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Maria's power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours.
2. After 5 hours, it loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours.
3. After 8 hours, the power bank has 28% charge left.

First, let's find out how much charge is left after the first 5 hours. If the power bank loses 9% each hour, it keeps 91% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, it keeps:
\[ 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 = 0.91^5 \]

Now, let's calculate \(0.91^5\):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]

So, after 5 hours, the power bank has about 62.4% of its charge left.

Next, for the next 3 hours, it loses 7% each hour, so it keeps 93% of its charge each hour. So, after 3 more hours, it keeps:
\[ 0.93 \times 0.93 \times 0.93 = 0.93^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \(0.93^3\):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]

So, after 3 more hours, the power bank has about 80.4% of the 62.4% charge left:
\[ 0.624 \times 0.804 \approx 0.502 \]

This means after 8 hours, the power bank has about 50.2% of its charge left. But we know it actually has 28% left. So, we need to find out what the initial charge was. If 50.2% of the initial charge is 28%, then:
\[ \text{Initial charge} = \frac{28}{0.502} \approx 55.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge is about 56%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"Janet works 40 hours a week and earns $25 each hour. She wants to save $2,000 for a car down payment.

First, we find out how much she earns in a week:

Next, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000:
\[ \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The answer is: \boxed{2}"
"Jamaar has $10 and he already bought some fruits. Let's see how much he spent:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add up the cost of the fruits he bought:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the money left is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. We need to find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received.

First, let's find out how many pieces Anne has in total:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we see how many packs Anne gave to her friends:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Now, we calculate how many pieces Anne gave to her friends:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we divide the total number of pieces given to her friends by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each friend received:

"Sure, let's figure out the price of carrots after three years. The price of carrots starts at $120 and goes up by 5% each year.

First, we need to find out what 5% of $120 is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 6 \]

So, each year the price goes up by $6. Now, let's calculate the price for each of the three years:

1. After the first year:
\[ 120 + 6 = 126 \]

2. After the second year:
\[ 126 + 6 = 132 \]

3. After the third year:
\[ 132 + 6 = 138 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years is $138. 

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{138}\)"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. So, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are only for selfies and 2 albums are only for portraits. So, the number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the two numbers together:

\[ \text{Total portraits and selfies} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. He reads 18 pages. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can first find out how long it takes to read 1 page:

\[ \text{Time for 1 page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages:

\[ \text{Time for 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The answer is: \boxed{60}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests leave early, so we subtract 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests leave late, so we subtract 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who left late. Since 15 guests left late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people check in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the hotel now has 98 guests. The answer is \boxed{98}."

"Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so each big one costs $12.

Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as big ones. Let's say she sold \(x\) big stuffed animals. Then she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

The money she made from selling big stuffed animals is \(12x\) dollars, and from small ones is \(4 \times 2x = 8x\) dollars.

The total money she made is \(12x + 8x = 20x\) dollars. We know she made $120, so:
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as big ones, she sold \(2 \times 6 = 12\) small stuffed animals.

So, the answer is 12."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so that's \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we have 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes. Each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, so 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.

In a month with 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this together! We have three different packages of sandwiches:

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches and costs $3.
2. The second package has 4 sandwiches and costs $6.
3. The third package has 8 sandwiches, and we need to find out how much it costs.

First, let's see how much each sandwich costs in the first package:
- If 2 sandwiches cost $3, then each sandwich costs $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50.

Now, let's see how much each sandwich costs in the second package:
- If 4 sandwiches cost $6, then each sandwich costs $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50.

So, each sandwich costs $1.50 in both the first and second packages. Since the prices are proportional, each sandwich also costs $1.50 in the third package.

Now, let's find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs:
- If each sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches will cost $1.50 × 8 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final answer is: \boxed{12}"
"Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000. So, he needs to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000 more.

He has to pay 10% of $2000 each month. To find 10% of $2000, we do $2000 * 10% = $2000 * 0.10 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 each month.

**Final Answer: $200**"
"Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst:
- 40% of 25 is \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \).
- So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with \( 25 - 10 = 15 \) red balloons.

Next, she released half of the yellow balloons:
- Half of 12 is \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \).
- So, she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection:
- 75% of 8 is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \).
- So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total balloons: \( 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \).

So, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is 34."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance the teacher won't collect the homework.
   - So, there's a 50% chance Marcus doesn't have to turn it in.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she gives everyone an extension.
   - So, there's a 40% chance Marcus doesn't have to turn it in.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40%).
   - Out of those 60%, there's a 20% chance Marcus gets a personal extension.
   - So, there's a 60% * 20% = 12% chance Marcus doesn't have to turn it in.

Now, we add up all the chances Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 40% (normal teacher with extension)
- 12% (normal teacher without extension, Marcus gets personal extension)

So, the total chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework is:
50% + 40% + 12% = 102%

But we need the chance that Marcus **does** have to turn in his homework, so we subtract from 100%:
100% - 102% = -2%

Since a negative percentage doesn't make sense here, we should consider the correct interpretation:
100% - 102% = 0% (This means Marcus will definitely have to turn in his homework, but we need to consider the correct interpretation of the probabilities).

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
89.8%

The correct answer is: 89.8%"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people.
2. 950 seats are for the graduates.
3. 300 seats are for the faculty.

First, we need to find out how many seats are left for friends and family. We do this by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total seats:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats left for friends and family.

Next, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets.

The answer is: 5"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - So, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium jelly beans.

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - So, for 150 medium jelly beans, he can eat \(150 \times 3 = 450\) small jelly beans.

So, the answer is that Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans. 

The correct option is: \(\boxed{450}\)"
"Melissa works 6 hours each day for 3 days. So, she works a total of:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She gets paid $15 each day, so for 3 days, she earns:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

But she has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, her parking cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After paying for parking, her total earnings are:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she earns per hour, we divide her total earnings by the total hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa's net pay per hour after expenses is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Ted buys 3 books for $16 each, so he spends \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars on books. He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so he spends \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars on pencils. 

To find out how much he spends in total, we add the money spent on books and pencils: \(48 + 18 = 66\) dollars.

So, the total amount spent is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Richard wants to make a video of his science experiment. He has a driveway that is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. 

First, we need to find out how many bottles he will place. Since he places a bottle every 3 feet, we divide 24 by 3:

\[ 24 \div 3 = 8 \]

This means there are 8 intervals between the bottles. Since he starts with a bottle at the beginning, he will have 9 bottles in total.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take him to place all the bottles. He takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals, we multiply 8 by 5:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

So, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The answer is: \boxed{40}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. He ordered 2 boxes, and each box has 40 apples.
   \[
   40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make. He wants to pack the apples with 8 apples in each pack.
   \[
   80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs}
   \]

So, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much the Parmesan cheese costs. It's $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds.
   - So, \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much the Mozzarella cheese costs. It's $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds.
   - So, \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

3. Now, we add the cost of both cheeses to find the total cost.
   - Total cost: \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

4. Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $50.
   - Money left: \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) dollars.

So, the money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Jim wants to go to college to earn more money. It takes 4 years to finish college, and he borrows $50,000 each year. So, the total amount he borrows is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 = \$200,000 \]

Before going to college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,000 each year. If he had continued working, he would have earned:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 = \$100,000 \]

So, the total money he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. Now, he needs to earn $200,000 (the amount he borrowed) plus $100,000 (the money he would have earned if he had not gone to college), which is:

\[ \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000 \]

After finishing college, Jim's new job pays him three times his old job's salary, so his new salary is:

\[ 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \]

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000, we divide the total amount by his new salary:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$75,000} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

**Final Answer: 4 years**"
"Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, let's find the new dimensions of the fabric:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, let's find the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's deliveries. One-fifth of 425 is 85, so on Tuesday they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204, so on Wednesday they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters delivered each day:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

So, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"Molly is having a party and invited 16 friends. Some friends want chicken salad and some want pasta salad.

- 10 friends want chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person.
- 6 friends want pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person.

To find out how much Molly needs to pay, we need to do some simple math.

For the chicken salad:
10 friends × $6.50 = $65

For the pasta salad:
6 friends × $6 = $36

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65 + $36 = $101

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.

The correct answer is: $101."
"Johnny's dad went to watch horse racing and bet some money. Here's what happened:

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $11 (which is $1 more than twice the $5 he lost).
3. In the third race, he lost $16.50 (which is 1.5 times the $11 he won).

Now, let's see how much he lost on average:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50.
- Total win: $11 (second race).
- Net loss: $21.50 (total loss) - $11 (total win) = $10.50.
- Number of races: 3.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{10.50}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. There are 26 countries in South America.
2. Each country has 5 cities.
3. Each city has 1000 people living in it.

First, we need to find out how many cities there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of countries by the number of cities in each country:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people live in all these cities. We do this by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people in each city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people in South America is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how tall Xavier is now. Xavier was 4 feet tall, and there are 12 inches in a foot. So, 4 feet is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Xavier grew 3 more inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 more inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's say the first person got \(x\) dollars.
2. The second person got \(x + 80\) dollars.
3. The third person got twice what the second person got, so that's \(2 \times (x + 80)\).

Now, we know the total amount is $1920. So, we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Let's simplify this:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Now, we need to find \(x\):
\[4x = 1920 - 240\]
\[4x = 1680\]
\[x = \frac{1680}{4}\]
\[x = 420\]

So, the first person got \(\boxed{420}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **How many hours did they work each day?**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours each day.

2. **How many days did they work in 3 weeks?**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in 3 weeks, they worked \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

3. **How many hours did they work in total?**
   - They worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - So, \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours in total.

4. **How many hours did each painter work?**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls he retrieved is 19.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Now, subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, let's find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
2. The car loses 21% of its value each year, which means it keeps 79% of its value each year.
3. We need to find the value of the car in 2010, which is 3 years later.

To find the value after 3 years, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Value after 3 years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, let's calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is \(\boxed{9860.78}\)."

"James's insurance cost went up because he had an accident. The normal cost is $120 a month. It went up by 60%, so we need to find out how much 60% of $120 is.

To find 60% of $120, we do:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the insurance cost went up by $72. Now we add this to the normal cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means the new monthly cost is $192. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance. The answer is:

"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, so they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

To find out how many movies they watch in one weekend, we add the movies from Saturday and Sunday:
4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies per weekend.

Now, to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to know how much food one cat eats in a day. Since each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day, one cat eats:
   \[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

2. Now, we have 3 cats, so the total amount of food they eat in a day is:
   \[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

3. We have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount they eat each day:

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this together!

Betsy and Donovan made a meal. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The whole meal took 98 minutes.

Let's say Donovan's part took \(D\) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes.

So, the total time is:
\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

This simplifies to:
\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Now, let's solve for \(D\):
\[2D = 98 - 18\]
\[2D = 80\]
\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part:
\[40 + 18 = 58\]

So, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.

The answer is: \(\boxed{58}\)"
"Okay, let's add up all the costs:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 for 30 minutes, so that's $150.
3. **Painkillers**: Each pill costs $4, and you get 30 pills, so that's $120.
4. **Parking**: The parking costs $6 per hour, and you need to park for 2 hours, so that's $12.

Now, let's add them all together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

So, the total cost is $482.

The correct answer is: \boxed{482}"
"James gets 80 emails every day. Out of these, 20% don't need any reply. So, let's find out how many emails he needs to reply to each day.

First, we calculate 20% of 80:
20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a reply. So, the number of emails he needs to reply to each day is:
80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Now, in a 5-day work week, the number of emails he replies to is:
64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, the answer is 320 emails."
"Sure, let's count the classes that visited the Science Center last week.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add them up:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is \(\boxed{247}\)."
"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

1. John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80.
2. Add these scores together: \(100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380\).
3. John took 4 tests, so we divide the total score by 4: \(380 ÷ 4 = 95\).

So, John's average score is 95.

The correct answer is: 95."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
   - 70% of 20 is \(20 \times 0.70 = 14\).
   - So, they ate 14 pizzas.
   - That means they have \(20 - 14 = 6\) pizzas left.

2. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club.
   - Twice as many as 20 is \(2 \times 20 = 40\).
   - The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
   - 80% of 40 is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\).
   - So, they ate 32 pizzas.
   - That means they have \(40 - 32 = 8\) pizzas left.

3. Now, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team.
   - \(6 + 8 = 14\).

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{14}\)"
"Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents.

First, let's find out how many big coupons he is sending:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **How many meatball sub sandwiches did Sidney order initially?**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **How many meatballs were in these sandwiches?**
   - Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.
   - So, \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. **How many meatballs did Mark eat?**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, \(4 \times 4 = 16\) meatballs.

4. **How many meatballs were left after Mark ate?**
   - So, \(28 - 16 = 12\) meatballs.

5. **How many more meatball sub sandwiches did Sidney order?**
   - Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   - So, \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

6. **How many meatballs were in the remaining sub sandwiches?**
   - The remaining sub sandwiches are the ones that were not eaten by Mark plus the additional ones ordered.
   - So, \(12 + 12 = 24\) meatballs.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks with 20 tons of fertiliser in each truck. That means he had:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

But, 1 out of every 4 trucks had a problem. So, the number of trucks with problems is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means 5 trucks couldn't deliver their fertiliser. So, the number of trucks that could deliver is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks had 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **How much butter does Dennis need?**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - So, he needs \(6 \times 1 = 6\) pounds of butter.

2. **How does the promotion work?**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 1.5 pounds of butter:**
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - So, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **How many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds?**
   - \(6 \div 1.5 = 4\) sets.

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - \(4 \times \$6.00 = \$24.00\).

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Kayla is having a party at a movie theater. The theater costs $125 to rent for 20 people. For each extra person, it costs $6 more.

First, let's count how many people are coming:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- 7 girls from her dance class.
- 13 family members.
- But 4 people said they couldn't come.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people can't come, the number of people who will come is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

Now, we need to find out how many extra people are coming:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the extra people is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

The total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending some of their money.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she had 3 times $60 before spending, which is $80. After spending a quarter, she has $60 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she had 2 times $60 before spending, which is $90. After spending one-third, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the money they both have left:
$60 (Maggie) + $60 (Riza) = $120

So, the total amount of money they have left is $120.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So in a week (7 days), it eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day. In a week, it eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas.
4. The total number of bananas bought is 315. So the third monkey eats \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.
5. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 147 by 7: \(147 \div 7 = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he put 250 pieces together. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he put 500 more pieces together.

"Jenny wants to buy 15 roses. Each rose costs $1.25. So, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny has five $5 bills, which is:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, the change Jenny should get is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters, we need to know how many quarters make up $6.25. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

So, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}

"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake costs $5.50.
   - So, \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars.

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter costs $11.
   - So, \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars.

3. **Sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda costs $1.50.
   - So, \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars.

Now, let's add all the money together:
- Milkshakes: $33

"Paul is waiting for his train at the station. The fourth train is the one he needs to catch. Here's how we figure out when he needs to wait:

1. The first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves after 30 minutes.
2. The second train comes 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 40 minutes from the start. It stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of 20 minutes). So, it leaves after 45 minutes.
3. The third train comes 60 minutes from the start and leaves immediately after it arrives.
4. The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 80 minutes from the start.

Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes). The fourth train arrives at 80 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 80 minutes.

"Melanie has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks, and she saves 10 toothpicks each week. So, she has saved:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs 200 toothpicks in total. So, she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, she needs:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The watch originally costs $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - So, he paid \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\) dollars.
3. Mr. Rogers then sold it to his friend at 120% of what he paid.
   - So, his friend paid \(1500 \times 1.20 = 1800\) dollars.
4. Now, we need to find out how much discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price.
   - The original price was $2000, and his friend paid $1800.
   - The discount amount is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) dollars.
5. To find the percentage discount:
   - \(\frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%\).

So, the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. **How many jellyfish does one spring make in one second?**
   - One spring makes 1 jellyfish every second.

2. **How many seconds are there in 4 hours?**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **How many jellyfish does one spring make in 4 hours?**
   - Since one spring makes 1 jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will make 14400 jellyfish.

4. **How many jellyfish do 5 springs make in 4 hours?**
   - If one spring makes 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will make \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

So, the answer is 72000 jellyfish.

"Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she got 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

If she bought each banana individually, it would cost her 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

But she bought the bananas in bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. So, for 10 bunches, she paid 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of bunches from the cost of individual bananas: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The answer is: $2.00."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total fence is:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how much it grows each year, we divide 8 inches by 4 years:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, we want to know how much it will grow in 13 years. Since it grows 2 inches each year, we multiply 2 inches by 13 years:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The answer is: \(\boxed{26}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Trekking Bikes**: Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Total bikes sold = 300
   - Trekking bikes = 300 / 2 = 150

2. **BMX Bikes**: 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - BMX bikes = 15% of 300 = 0.15 × 300 = 45

3. **MTB Bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - MTB bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, let's calculate the money made from each type of bike:

1. **Trekking Bikes**: Each Trekking bike costs $450.
   - Money from Trekking bikes = 150 × 450 = 67500

2. **BMX Bikes**: Each BMX bike costs half of an MTB, so it costs $250.
   - Money from BMX bikes = 45 × 250 = 11250

3. **MTB Bikes**: Each MTB bike costs $500.
   - Money from MTB bikes = 105 × 500 = 52500

Finally, let's add up all the money made:
- Total money = Money from Trekking bikes + Money from BMX bikes + Money from MTB bikes
- Total money = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour.
2. The truck takes away 3 bales of hay each hour.
3. So, each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck takes away 3 bales, which means the field gets 2 more bales each hour (5 - 3 = 2).

Now, if they work for 6 hours:
- Each hour, 2 more bales are added to the field.
- So, in 6 hours, 2 bales/hour × 6 hours = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is **12**.

The correct answer is: **12**."
"John has 8 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

On the weekend, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each day. So:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday and weekend time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many hours this is, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that each bag has 10 apples.
2. The orchard sold 2000 apples in total.
3. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:
   \[
   \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]
4. Each bag is sold for $5.
5. To find out how much money the orchard earned, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

   200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, if we start with \( x \) kilograms, after the T-Rex ate, there would be \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms left.
2. Then, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find out how much meat was on the triceratops at the start, we need to solve \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \). We can do this by multiplying both sides by 4:

\[ x = 270 \times 4 = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The answer is: \(\boxed{1080}\)"
"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to know the total area of the walls and how much paint we need.

First, let's find the area of the walls:
- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area for each of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area for each of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of paint we need. One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. So, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

So, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step.

1. Ellen started with 12 sodas.
2. She shook 3 of them.
3. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now there are 2 unshaken sodas left.
4. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
5. After her brother took some, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, we need to find out the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda. There are 2 shaken sodas and a total of 8 sodas left.

To find the chance, we divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To change this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is 25%.

The answer is: 25%"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in a primary school class.

We have two trains that are going in opposite directions. One train is going really fast at 60 miles per hour, and the other train is going slower at 30 miles per hour (which is half of 60).

Now, let's see how far each train goes in 3 hours:

- The fast train goes 60 miles in 1 hour, so in 3 hours, it goes \(60 \times 3 = 180\) miles.
- The slow train goes 30 miles in 1 hour, so in 3 hours, it goes \(30 \times 3 = 90\) miles.

To find out how far apart they are, we add the distances they each traveled:

\[180 + 90 = 270\]

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The answer is: 270 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many days are there from March 1st to April 19th.
   - March has 31 days.
   - From March 1st to March 31st, that's 31 days.
   - From April 1st to April 19th, that's 19 days.
   - So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

2. Billy takes 20% of the days off. Let's find out how many days that is.
   - 20% of 50 days is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
   - So, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

3. Now, let's see how many people Billy helps each day.
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
   - So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

4. Finally, let's find out how many people he helps in 40 days.
   - If he helps 6 people each day, in 40 days he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to know how many people each bus and car can carry and then add them together.

Each bus can carry 35 people, and there are 12 buses. So, the total number of people the buses can carry is:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

Each car can carry 3 people, and there are 20 cars. So, the total number of people the cars can carry is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, we add the number of people the buses and cars can carry to find the total number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the maximum number of people that could have been inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from 24:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to 20:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   So, Jeff is 30 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"The biggest slide is 300 feet long and people go down at 60 feet per minute. So, the time to go down is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long and people go down at 80 feet per minute. So, the time to go down is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes to go down the biggest slide, we subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the biggest slide:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The answer is: 2 minutes"
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each day. So, let's add up the time:

- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes

So, each day Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks. 

Since 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour, we can find out how much time he spends in 5 days:

- \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, let's convert 300 minutes into hours:

- \(300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\)

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran \(8 + 28 = 36\) miles. The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. So, Ahito ran \(52 - 36 = 16\) miles.

The answer is 16 miles."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Sheila first charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we find 20% of $20.00:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, we subtract $4.00 from $20.00:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, we find 10% of $30.00:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, we subtract $3.00 from $30.00:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]
6. Finally, we add the new purchases to the remaining balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

The correct answer is: \boxed{113.00}"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. So if there are \( J \) jellyfish in total, then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

2. Out of these large jellyfish, a third of them change color to blue when a UV light is turned on. So the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

3. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

4. To find \( J \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
   \[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

So, Caroline is \(\boxed{24}\) years old."
"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to do some simple math.

1. First, we find out how much money Lauren needs each year in retirement:
   \[
   40,000 \text{ (40% of her current salary)}
   \]

2. Then, we find out how much money Lauren saves each year:
   \[
   20,000 \text{ (20% of her current salary)}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much money Lauren needs in total for her retirement:
   \[
   40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
   \]

4. Finally, we find out how many years Lauren needs to save this amount:
   \[
   \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
   \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

The answer is: 40 years."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \]

Each part is 25 centimeters long. Now, he needs to cut each 25-centimeter part into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys.
2. If 40% is 240, we can find 1% by dividing 240 by 40:
   \[ 1\% = \frac{240}{40} = 6 \]
3. Now, to find 100%, we multiply 6 by 100:
   \[ 100\% = 6 \times 100 = 600 \]
   So, the total number of students in the school is 600.
4. Since 40% are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.
5. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
   \[ 60\% \text{ of } 600 = \frac{60}{100} \times 600 = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"Sure, let's do this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much the pots and soil cost together. The pots cost $19 and the soil cost $26. So, we add these two amounts:
   \[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

2. Next, we use the coupon which gives us $7 off. So, we subtract $7 from the total cost:
   \[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, the amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we count how many heels there are in total. There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels. So, the total number of heels is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

2. Next, we find out how tall all the heels are together. The 4-inch heels add up to \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches. The 2-inch heels add up to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches. So, all the heels together are \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches tall.

3. To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels. So, we do \(18 \div 6 = 3\).

The average height of the heels is 3 inches.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. 

First, let's find out how many miles she plans to hike each day:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to finish 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"Okay, let's do this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much money the store will get from selling the red balls.
   - There are 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9.
   - So, \(3 \times 9 = 27\).
   - The store will get $27 from the red balls.

2. Next, we need to find out how much money the store will get from selling the blue balls.
   - There are 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5.
   - So, \(11 \times 5 = 55\).
   - The store will get $55 from the blue balls.

3. Then, we need to find out how much money the store will get from selling the green balls.
   - There are 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3.
   - So, \(25 \times 3 = 75\).
   - The store will get $75 from the green balls.

4. Finally, we need to add up all the money the store will get from selling all the balls.
   - The total money is \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\).

"Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class. This year, there are more students because the number increased by 20%.

To find out how many more students there are, we need to calculate 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more students this year. 

To find the total number of students this year, we add the 10 new students to the 50 students from last year:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students this year is 60.

The correct answer is: 60."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how many times it blinks in 1 minute. So, we divide 255 by 5:

\[ 255 \div 5 = 51 \]

This means the light blinks 51 times every minute.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. Since it blinks 51 times in 1 minute, we divide 459 by 51:

\[ 459 \div 51 = 9 \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so she took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so she took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 8 hours, let's use 9 for simplicity).

Now, let's add up the time:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

So, the total time is \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"John visits his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive there at 70 miles per hour. For a round trip, he drives 280 miles each time (because 2 hours × 70 miles per hour = 140 miles one way, and 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles round trip). Since he visits twice a month, he drives 560 miles in total (because 280 miles × 2 visits = 560 miles).

So, the answer is 560 miles."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. So in 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to know how many toys the first four workers make in one hour.
   - Two workers make 6 toys each, so together they make \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys.
   - Another two workers make 4 toys each, so together they make \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys.
   - So, the first four workers together make \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys in one hour.

2. Now, we need to find out how many toys they make in 10 hours.
   - Since they make 20 toys in one hour, in 10 hours they make \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. The total order is 400 toys, and they still need 20 more toys to complete it.
   - So, the five workers together have made \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. We already know the first four workers made 200 toys, so the fifth worker must have made \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes in one hour, we divide the total toys he made by the number of hours he worked.
   - So, the fifth worker makes \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

The answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.

Let's work backwards:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the 32 stickers Luis had must be half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

\[
\boxed{64}

"John bought 3 big bags of M&M, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Now, if 1 ounce of M&M has 30 pieces, then 30 ounces will have:

30 ounces * 30 pieces/ounce = 900 pieces

If John puts 10 pieces in each small bag, then the number of small bags he can make is:

900 pieces / 10 pieces/bag = 90 bags

So, the answer is 90 small bags."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say Arnold painted \( A \) eggs, so Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

Now, let's write it down:
- Arnold: \( A \) eggs
- Madeline: \( A \) eggs
- Camden: \( S + 12 \) eggs
- Sarah: \( S \) eggs

The total is:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Camden painted:
\[ S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Arnold and Madeline together painted:
\[ 2A = 22 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

So, Arnold painted 11 eggs.

"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into groups of 8 and put each group into a box. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's find out how many boxes Nik will need:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the crayons:
\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the weight of the boxes:
\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much, so he earns $5000 \times 2 = $10000 per month. Together, Valerie and her brother earn $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month. Their mother earns twice what Valerie and her brother earn together, so she earns $15000 \times 2 = $30000 per month. 

To find out how much money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
2. She spends 40 minutes on the beach.
3. The beach part is 2 miles, and she spends 40 minutes on it.
4. So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles in 40 minutes.
5. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed, so her speed is 1 mile in 20 minutes.
6. The sidewalk part is 1 mile, so it will take her 20 minutes.
7. Total time = time on the beach + time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 60 minutes.

The answer is: \boxed{60}"
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. Let's see how much she has saved so far:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane wants to save a total of $60. So, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she saves each week:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."
"Okay, let's count the blue birds step by step:

1. There are 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   So, there are 21 blue birds in these 3 trees.

2. There are 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 blue birds in these 2 trees.

3. There is 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \[
   3
   \]
   So, there are 3 blue birds in this tree.

4. Now, let's add all the blue birds together:
   \[
   21 + 8 + 3 = 32
   \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles and then he has 60 marbles.
2. 2 dozen is 2 times 12, so that's 24 marbles.
3. So, before getting those 24 marbles, Bob had:
   \[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ marbles} \]
4. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have:
   \[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the answer is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug has an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle, he is now able to drink the water.

To find out the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to make sure the mixture in the water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's say the temperature of the second mug is \( T \) degrees.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be found by averaging the temperatures of the two mugs, but since we are mixing different volumes, we need to use a weighted average:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"Okay, let's count the animals step by step.

1. **Cows:**
   - Melanie's father starts with 50 cows.
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows each day for 21 days.
   - So, the total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.
   - Total cows now = 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

2. **Chickens:**
   - Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens.
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens each day for 21 days.
   - So, the total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.
   - Total chickens now = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is **700**."
"Russell orders his favorite bagels. Each pack has 9 bagels and costs $10.00. If he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount.

First, let's find out how much 4 packs cost before the discount:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out the discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Russell gets 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of each single bagel:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find out how many scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - So, \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - So, \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - This means \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes are needed for 1 scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop needs \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will need \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \) potatoes.

So, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so he eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, so he eats:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together, Chester eats:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens are in 240 eggs:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The answer is: 20"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Jess sees 17 green jelly beans.
2. There are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones. So, if there are 17 green jelly beans, then there are \(2 \times 17 = 34\) red jelly beans.
3. Now, we add the green and red jelly beans together: \(17 + 34 = 51\).
4. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. So, to find out how many blue jelly beans there are, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total: \(60 - 51 = 9\).

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 9.

The answer is: \(\boxed{9}\)"
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each tree gives him 6 lemons every year. So, in one year, he gets:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.
2. The total number of passengers is 84.
3. Let's find out how many groups of 14 (5 men + 9 women) fit into 84.
   - \( 84 \div 14 = 6 \)
4. So, there are 6 groups of 5 men and 6 groups of 9 women.
5. Calculate the number of men:
   - \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) men
6. Calculate the number of women:
   - \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) women
7. If 20 women leave the bus, we need to subtract 20 from 54.

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

The answer is: \(\boxed{34}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers each day.
   - So, the number of individual sunflowers sold each day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Bouquets sold:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets each day.
   - So, the number of bouquets sold each day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Sunflowers in bouquets:**
   - Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers in bouquets sold each day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Total sunflowers sold each day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold each day is the sum of individual sunflowers and sunflowers in bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"Adam has $100 to spend on rocks. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

He sells 60% of his rocks. So, he sells:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Each rock is sold for $7, so the money he gets from selling 12 rocks is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam started with $100 and now has $84, so he loses:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money Adam loses is:

"To find out how fast Sid was traveling on average, we need to know the total distance he traveled and the total time he took.

First, let's add up the distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in the first part.
- Then, he traveled 140 miles in the second part.
- So, the total distance is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's add up the time:
- He took 2 hours for the first part.
- Then, he took 3 hours for the second part.
- So, the total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance ÷ Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles ÷ 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means out of 100 tickets, 20 of them could win.
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has 3 times that, which is 60%.
3. To find the chance that both tickets win, we multiply their chances together:
   - First ticket: 20% or 0.20
   - Second ticket: 60% or 0.60
   - Multiply them: 0.20 × 0.60 = 0.12
4. To change 0.12 to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   - 0.12 × 100 = 12%

So, the chance that both tickets are winners is 12%. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

3. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected:
   \[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, let's add up all the seashells:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots on weekdays.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. That's 2 days, so he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots on the weekend.

So, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is \(20 + 10 = 30\).

The answer is 30."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how long the second song is, we need to add 60% of 5 minutes to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is:
0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is:
5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the time of both songs:
5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The answer is: 13 minutes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find the selling price of one mobile device:**

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so:
   \[
   7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, Ned is 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so:

"To help 2300 people with their energy needs, we need to find out how many bottles of juice are needed.

1. Each bottle of juice can cover 20% of one person's energy needs.
2. So, to cover 100% of one person's energy needs, we need 5 bottles (since 100% divided by 20% equals 5).
3. For 2300 people, we need \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Now, Hortex can make 4200 bottles each day. To find out how many more bottles are needed:
1. We need 11500 bottles in total.
2. Hortex already makes 4200 bottles.
3. So, we need \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) more bottles.

The answer is 7300 more bottles."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Carla has 8 babies.
2. She dresses 3 out of 4 of them in purple, so:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies in purple} \]
3. She dresses 1 out of 4 of them in blue, so:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies in blue} \]

Next, we find out how many of these babies are wearing bows:
4. All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
5. 1 out of 3 of the purple-wearers wear bows, so:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies in purple with bows} \]

Now, we add the number of blue and purple babies wearing bows:
6. Total number of bow-wearers = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Finally, we find the chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
7. Number of purple babies wearing bows = 2
8. Total number of bow-wearers = 4
9. So, the chance is:
   \[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To make it a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the answer is:

"Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he got 30 * 3 = $90 from the last sale.

To find out how much money he earned in total, we add up all the money he got from selling his land:
$50 (first sale) + $30 (second sale) + $90 (last sale) = $170.

So, the total money Abraham earned is $170.

The correct answer is: $170."

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total found from the initial number:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each. So, together they have:
   \[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

2. The third complex is 60% bigger than the 400 apartments. To find 60% of 400:
   \[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]
   So, the third complex has:
   \[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

3. Now, add all the apartments together:
   \[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

4. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:

5. He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total money he makes in a week is:
   \[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

So, the money John makes in a week is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it's \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Let's call that number \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, \(x = 1000\). This means the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. A 9-year-old avocado tree produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

1. We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So if the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters long, the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters long.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So if the yellow rope is \( Y \) centimeters long, the blue rope is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters long.
3. The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So we can write the equation: \( 4B + B + Y = 37 \).

Now, let's find the length of the yellow rope (\( Y \)):
- Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation \( 4B + B + Y = 37 \).
- This gives us \( 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \).
- Simplifying, we get \( 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \).
- Combining like terms, we get \( 6Y - 35 = 37 \).
- Adding 35 to both sides, we get \( 6Y = 72 \).
- Dividing both sides by 6, we get \( Y = 12 \).

Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long. Let's find the length of the blue rope (\( B \)):
- Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we get \( B = 12 - 7 = 5 \).

Finally, let's find the length of the red rope (\( R \)):
- Since \( R = 4B \), we get \( R = 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Ronnie got $5, and Rissa got three times as much, so Rissa got:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

After giving some money to their little sister, Rissa has \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money left. This means:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

So, \( x = 15 - 12 = 3 \). This means both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.

Ronnie started with $5 and gave $3, so he has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars left} \]

The answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a puzzle!

We know the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total. Half of the mural is yellow, so that means 6 pints are yellow.

Now, we have 6 pints left for the other colors: red, white, and purple. Since these three colors are used equally, we divide the 6 pints by 3.

So, \(6 \div 3 = 2\).

This means 2 pints of paint are used for each of the red, white, and purple colors.

The question asks how many pints of red paint were used. So, the answer is 2 pints.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet. So, the area of one bedroom is:
   \[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

2. Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area of the bedrooms is:
   \[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

3. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is:
   \[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

5. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
   \[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"On Monday, Alice saw 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that, she saw double the number of puffs from the day before. Let's count the puffs for each day:

- **Monday**: 3 puffs
- **Tuesday**: 3 puffs × 2 = 6 puffs
- **Wednesday**: 6 puffs × 2 = 12 puffs
- **Thursday**: 12 puffs × 2 = 24 puffs
- **Friday**: 24 puffs × 2 = 48 puffs

Now, let's add up all the puffs:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is 93.

The answer is: 93"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. A regular box has 100 pods and costs $12.
2. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
3. 20% of 100 pods is 20 pods.
4. So, the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.
5. The special box costs $12 and has 120 pods.
6. To find the cost per pod in the special box, we divide $12 by 120 pods.
7. $12 ÷ 120 = $0.10 per pod.
8. Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, for $1, you can buy 1 ÷ $0.10 = 10 pods.
9. Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

The answer is: \boxed{10}"
"Thomas takes out $1000 in 20 dollar bills. That means he gets 50 bills because:
\[ 1000 \div 20 = 50 \]

On the way home, he loses 10 bills. So he has:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay a bill. So he uses:
\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

That means he has:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Then he triples his money. So he has:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, he changes all his money to 5 dollar bills. So he gets:
\[ 1200 \div 5 = 240 \]

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it, so he has 5 - (5 × 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Each day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

- After the first day, he uses 20% of 2.75 inches, so he has 2.75 × 0.80 = 2.20 inches left.
- After the second day, he uses 20% of 2.20 inches, so he has 2.20 × 0.80 = 1.76 inches left.
- After the third day, he uses 20% of 1.76 inches, so he has 1.76 × 0.80 = 1.408 inches left.
- After the fourth day, he uses 20% of 1.408 inches, so he has 1.408 × 0.80 = 1.1264 inches left.
- After the fifth day, he uses 20% of 1.1264 inches, so he has 1.1264 × 0.80 = 0.90112 inches left.

Since 0.90112 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. 

First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, let's add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

So, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[
\boxed{17}

Answer: 17"
"James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more than he drills. So, the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth. The total number of teeth fixed is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiply by 100:
\[
\left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth. The answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. So, the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000 \]

But 2/5 of the milk was sour and couldn't be sold. So, the amount of sour milk is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \]

The cost of the sour milk is:

\[ 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin is \( C \) years old now.
2. In 7 years, Colin will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
3. Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be in 7 years, so Wendy is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \) years old now.

Now, let's look at the second part:
4. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
5. Wendy is currently \( 5 \times (C + 7) \) years old.
6. In 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's current age, so \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Let's solve this:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3} \times (C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500.
2. To find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy, we divide $27000 by $500:
   \[
   \frac{27000}{500} = 54
   \]
3. Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, Bob can buy:
   \[
   54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
   \]
4. Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools. There are 3 schools, so:
   \[
   \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
   \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

So, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find out how much Ali's coal order costs, we need to do a few simple steps.

First, we need to know how many bags of coal Ali needs. Each bag is 50 kg, and Ali ordered 850 kg. So, we divide 850 by 50:
\[ 850 \div 50 = 17 \]
This means Ali needs 17 bags of coal.

Next, we need to find out how much these 17 bags cost. Each bag costs $18. So, we multiply 17 by 18:
\[ 17 \times 18 = 306 \]
This means the total cost of Ali's order is $306.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
2. Kate has 6 friends, so we need to find out how many slices of each type of pizza all the friends will eat in total.

For cheese pizza:
- Each friend eats 6 slices.
- 6 friends × 6 slices = 36 slices.

For pepperoni pizza:
- Each friend eats 4 slices.
- 6 friends × 4 slices = 24 slices.

Now, let's see how many whole pizzas are needed:

For cheese pizza:
- Each pizza has 12 slices.
- 36 slices ÷ 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

For pepperoni pizza:
- Each pizza has 8 slices.
- 24 slices ÷ 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, which is a total of 6 pizzas.

The answer is: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles each day for 3 days, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 5 miles each day for 2 days, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we add the miles from both sets of days:
\[9 + 10 = 19\]

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week.

The answer is: 19 miles."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.
2. In 15 minutes, he makes \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs because there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour.
3. But 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so he actually gains \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs every 15 minutes.
4. To have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it takes. Since he gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we divide 60 by 3: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
5. Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.
6. 300 minutes is the same as 5 hours because \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \).

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer: 5 hours**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Digimon is 20 years old now, so it came out 20 years ago.
2. John is 28 years old now, so 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8, Jim was \(8 \div 2 = 4\) years old.
4. Now, 20 years have passed, so Jim is \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

So, Jim is now 24 years old.

The answer is: 24"
"Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices (1 more than Doxa), and her brother ate 3 slices (1 more than her sister). So, they all ate a total of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages and ordered 50 more.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had 12 bandages at the start of the second day, so they needed \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages.
   - They ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit and have some left over.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They ordered 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\) bandages.
   - But they only had 78 bandages left, so they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than 109.
   - Therefore, they started with \(109 - 31 = 78\) bandages minus the 31 they didn't use, which means they started with 34 bandages.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"May is getting her hair cut and colored. The color costs $40. For the haircut, it costs $30 for each inch cut. Her hair went from 10 inches to 8 inches, so she cut off 2 inches.

The total cost is $100."
"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. In April, there are 4 weeks, so she works:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so each day she earns:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]

For 24 days, she earns:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she had no absences, she gets an extra $10. So, her total earnings are:

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Jason earned step by step.

1. For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, he gets $0.50 each time:
   \[6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\]
   So, he earned $3.00 from emptying the dishwasher.

2. For doing his laundry once, he gets $3.00:
   \[1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\]
   So, he earned $3.00 from doing his laundry.

3. For taking the trash out twice, he gets $0.75 each time:
   \[2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\]
   So, he earned $1.50 from taking the trash out.

4. For cleaning his room once, he gets $1.50:
   \[1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\]
   So, he earned $1.50 from cleaning his room.

Now, let's add all the money he earned:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00.

2. Each pack has 5 pens.
3. So, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

Next, let's find out the number of black pens:
4. Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
5. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}\).

Now, let's add the red and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
6. Total number of pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

So, the total number of pens Alain has is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That means each bottle of scotch costs $60 because \(600 \div 10 = 60\).

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys \(10 \times 2 = 20\) bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle of cognac costs \(60 + 30 = 90\) dollars.

He buys 20 bottles of cognac, so the total cost for the cognac is \(20 \times 90 = 1800\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends: \(600 + 1800 = 2400\) dollars.

So, the total amount John spends on everything is \(\boxed{2400}\)."

20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50

And the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted is:
40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Adding them together, the total number of trees he planted is:
50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140.

We know that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. Let's call the number of coffee mugs \( x \).

So, the equation is:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to find out what \( 4x \) is. To do this, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Now, we need to find \( x \). We do this by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find out how many fish have red stripes. We know that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes. So, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]
So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:
\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]
So, 44 fish are left.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 44 fish have blue stripes. We know that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we do:
\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]
So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:
\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:
\[ 42 \]

The final answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each. So, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each. So, \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. The total number of colors she had initially is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Now, her sister steals one palette with 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so she uses \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. That means she has \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors left from that set.

So, the total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\).

The final answer is:

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. His house is 7 times as tall as he is, so:
   \[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]
3. The first floor to the ceiling is 3 times as tall as he is, so:
   \[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]
4. The height of the house is the sum of the first floor to the ceiling and the second floor height. So, the second floor height is:
   \[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is \(\boxed{240}\) inches."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know that team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells.
   - 40% of 700 is \( 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \) shells.
   - So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

2. Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found their shells.
   - We subtract the shells found by team Alphas from the total: \( 700 - 280 = 420 \) shells.

3. Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   - 60% of 420 is \( 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \) shells.
   - So, team The finders found 252 shells.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.
   - We subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells: \( 420 - 252 = 168 \) shells.
   - So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

The answer is: \(\boxed{168}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Bernie has 4 dogs and they need to walk a total of 3 miles on average each day. So, for all 4 dogs together, they need to walk:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog: 1 mile
- The second dog: 4 miles
- The third dog: 3 miles

Adding these up, we get:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan that is 40% of the house value.
   - So, the loan amount is \( 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \).

3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts.
   - So, the amount used to pay debts is \( 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \).

4. The leftover amount after paying off the debts is:
   - \( 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \).

So, the money John had leftover after paying off his debts is \( \boxed{40000} \)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught.
2. The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
3. The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
4. The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.
5. Now, let's add these weights together:
   \[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Deandre will earn by selling these tunas. The price of tuna is $0.50 per kilogram.

6. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
   \[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars."
"Trinity sells magazines at a price that is \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72.

First, we need to find out how much she sells each magazine for. We do this by multiplying $72 by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, she sells each magazine for $99.

Next, we need to find out how much profit she makes. Profit is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{27}\)"
"Brian used a dehumidifier to make his basement less damp. The dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. 

- On the low setting, it removes 1 liter of water each day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters each day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters each day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for:
- 3 days on the low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\)
- 3 days on the medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\)
- 5 days on the high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\)

Now, let's add up all the water removed:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

3. The total amount of medicine for one dose is:
   \[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]
4. For 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
   \[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Ali's class has 120 students.
2. John's classes each have \(\frac{1}{8}\) of Ali's class capacity.
3. So, one of John's classes has \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
4. John has 2 classes, so the total for John's school is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) students.
5. Now, we add the capacities of both schools: \( 120 + 30 = 150 \).

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

The answer is: \(\boxed{150}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister.
2. He needs to pay an extra 2% interest on the $300.
3. To find the interest, we do: \(300 \times 0.02 = 6\).
4. So, the total amount Stephen needs to pay is: \(300 + 6 = 306\).

Now, Stephen pays $25 every month for 11 months:
5. \(25 \times 11 = 275\).

So, the remaining amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is:
6. \(306 - 275 = 31\).

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Jordan has 2 children, and each child needs 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes needed for both children is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

This means Jordan changes the other half, so he changes:

\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Tim entered a competition to guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, and they fit about 80% efficiently. He thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red. The actual number of red jelly beans is 900.

First, let's find the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the effective volume for packing jelly beans:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many jelly beans can fit in the jar:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Then, we estimate how many of these jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The actual number of red jelly beans is 900. So, how far off was Tim's guess?

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The bus can carry 200 people.
2. When the bus left Chengli city, it had 20 people.
3. At the first stop, 40 people got on the bus.
   - So, now there are \(20 + 40 = 60\) people on the bus.
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people got on the bus.
   - That means \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \) people got on.
   - Now there are \(60 + 30 = 90\) people on the bus.
5. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubled.
   - So, \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people are now on the bus.
6. The bus can carry 200 people, so we need to find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus.
   - The bus needs \(200 - 180 = 20\) more people to be full.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

The final answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces. One piece is longer than the other. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

Let's say the shorter piece is \(x\) feet long. Then the longer piece is \(4x\) feet long.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[x + 4x = 40\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x = 40\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 5:
\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece:
\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"Aiden is making meatballs for a cookout. He uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. He can make 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs.

"Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If her class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats, we need to find out how many cupcakes she made.

Let's say the number of cupcakes is \( c \).

The number of brownies she makes is \( 3c - 2 \).

Each of the 5 people gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we have:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Manicure and Pedicure Cost:**
   - A manicure costs $35.
   - A pedicure costs $40.
   - The salon gives a 20% discount if you get both.
   - 20% of $35 is \(35 \times 0.20 = 7\).
   - So, the discounted cost of the manicure is \(35 - 7 = 28\).
   - 20% of $40 is \(40 \times 0.20 = 8\).
   - So, the discounted cost of the pedicure is \(40 - 8 = 32\).
   - The total cost for both is \(28 + 32 = 60\).

2. **Nail Art Cost:**
   - Nail art costs $3 per nail.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Price in November**: The toy costs $40.
2. **Price Increase in December**: The price went up by 80%. So, we need to find 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\).
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72.
3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price went down by 50%. So, we need to find 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 is \(72 \times 0.50 = 36\).
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36.

So, the price of the toy after the discount in January is $36.

The final answer is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. 

To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we can set up a simple equation. If 9 is 3 quarters (or 3/4) of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can write it as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{(number of novels this year)} \]

To find the number of novels she wrote this year, we need to find out what number, when multiplied by 3/4, gives us 9. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \text{(number of novels this year)} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

4. **Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - They spend 20 hours cleaning out of 40 hours available.
   - So, \( \frac{20}{40} = 0.5 \).
   - Convert to percentage: \( 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, the custodian spends **50%** of their day cleaning classrooms."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the books each shelf can hold:
- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, one bookcase can hold \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer:**
2"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs. One dozen is 12 eggs, so 5 dozens is:
   \[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

2. The cost of one dozen eggs is $2.40, so for 5 dozens, the total cost is:
   \[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs, she can make:
   \[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]
   Since each set is $1, her total revenue is:
   \[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

4. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
   \[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of them are red, so he has 50 red hats. That leaves 50 hats. Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

This means he has 30 blue hats. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is:

\[
50 - 30 = 20
\]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats. The answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes in a bag with 30 sticks and costs $18.00 per bag. But there's a discount of $3.00, so the bag now costs $15.00.

To find out how much each stick costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sticks. So, we do:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This means each stick costs $0.50. Since we need the answer in cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

The answer is: \boxed{50}"

"Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a party. She makes some strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes is \( B \).

We know:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
And the total number of cubes is:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting \( B \) in the total cubes equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

The final answer is: \(\boxed{96}\)"

"Okay, let's count the flashlights and candles step by step.

**Flashlights:**
- Each person has 1 flashlight, and there are 4 people, so that's \(4\) flashlights.
- Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms, so that's \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights.
- Total flashlights: \(4 + 16 = 20\).

**Candles:**
- Half the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so that's \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so that's \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
- Total candles: \(16 + 20 = 36\).

**Total:**
- Flashlights and candles together: \(20 + 36 = 56\).

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is \(\boxed{56}\)."

"To find out how much longer it will take for the varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how long it takes for the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting.
- For 6 paintings, it will take \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes for the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting.
- For 6 paintings, it will take \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish, we subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish:

"Crista has 20 plants. Some of her plants need different amounts of water each day. Let's figure out how much water she needs in total.

1. **Half a cup for 4 plants:**
   \[
   4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **1 cup for 8 plants:**
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup} = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup each. First, we find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup:**
   \[
   20 \text{ plants} - (4 \text{ plants} + 8 \text{ plants}) = 8 \text{ plants}
   \]
   So, 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each. Now, we calculate the water needed:

"Phineas Frog needs to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of the distance is on land, and the other half is in water.

On land:
- Distance = 100 yards
- Speed = 20 yards per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

In water:
- Distance = 100 yards
- Speed = 10 yards per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time to get back home:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home.

"Alicia has to take her clothes to the dry cleaners every week. Each week, she takes 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt. The dry cleaners charge $5.00 for each blouse, $6.00 for each skirt, and $8.00 for each pair of pants.

First, let's find out how much it costs for one week:
- For the blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00\)
- For the pants: \(2 \text{ pants} \times \$8.00 = \$16.00\)
- For the skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 = \$6.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Alicia does this every week for 5 weeks. So, we need to find out how much it costs for 5 weeks:
\[

"John talks really fast now! His normal speed is 150 words per minute, but after training, he can talk 2.5 times faster. So, his new speed is:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ words per minute} \]

Now, he needs to say 10 pages of words. Each page has 450 words, so for 10 pages, he needs to say:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

To find out how long it takes him to say 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we do:

\[ \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes him 12 minutes to say 10 pages. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were there, so:
\[50 + 20 = 70\]

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so:
\[2 \times 70 = 140\]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total for these days is:
\[60 \times 4 = 240\]

Now, we add up all the people Conor saw:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480\]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[480\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn is \(\boxed{210}\)."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food, and there are 3 German Shepherds. So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) kilograms.

2. Next, we need to find out how much food the Bulldogs eat in a day. Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food, and there are 2 Bulldogs. So, \(3 \times 2 = 6\) kilograms.

3. Now, we add the food for the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs to find out the total food they eat in a day. So, \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

4. Finally, we need to find out how much food they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount by 7. So, \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

The answer is \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - Gary bought the boat for $9000.
   - It lost 30% of its value in the first year.
   - 30% of $9000 is \(9000 \times 0.30 = 2700\).
   - So, the boat is now worth \(9000 - 2700 = 6300\).

2. **Second Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It lost another 30% of its value in the second year.
   - 30% of $6300 is \(6300 \times 0.30 = 1890\).
   - So, the boat is now worth \(6300 - 1890 = 4410\).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It lost 20% of its value in the third year.
   - 20% of $4410 is \(4410 \times 0.20 = 882\).
   - So, the boat is now worth \(4410 - 882 = 3528\).

So, after three years, the boat is worth \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, we do:
   \[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights.
   - Each night costs $80.
   - So, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Cost:**
   - Helen took the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the hotel night cost.
   - 10% of $80 is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add the hotel cost and the bus cost together.
   - Total cost is \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

"To find out how much force John needs to push the car, we first need to know the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are 2 children, so the children together weigh 75 pounds × 2 = 150 pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.

John needs to push the car with a force that is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:
1600 × 0.01 = 16 pounds.

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.

The correct answer is: \boxed{16}"

"Mia is 40 years old, and she is 16 years younger than Emma. So, Emma must be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

To find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and then divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
\]

So, the average of their ages is 48."
"Tom, Nancy, and Benny found seashells on the beach. Tom found 214, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86. They found a total of:

214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells

The answer is: $180.00"
"Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle. Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. Half of Steve's time is 5 hours (because 10 divided by 2 is 5). So, Anna took 5 hours plus 2 hours, which is 7 hours.

The answer is 7 hours."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, one pig eats:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. Dexter has 5 pigs, so all the pigs together eat:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. In one week (7 days), the pigs will eat:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the feed left will be:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the answer is:
\[

"John invited 20 friends to his party. Each friend will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/friend} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from before. So, the number of hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs has 6 hot dogs. So, the number of packs he needs to buy is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2. So, the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend \(\boxed{12}\) dollars on hot dogs."
"Frances sells cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each and 40 cookies at $1 each. She also buys 5 trays for $4 each.

First, let's find out how much money she makes from selling cupcakes:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2 = \$40 \]

Next, let's find out how much money she makes from selling cookies:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 = \$40 \]

So, the total money she makes is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Now, let's find out how much she spends on trays:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total money she made:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - There are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - So, 5 more children join.
   - Total number of children now = 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - So, 10 × 2 = 20 new children join.
   - Total number of children now = 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave.
   - Total number of children now = 30 (current total) - 5 (original 5 children who left) = 25.

So, the final number of children following the truck is:

"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which is 30 minutes each day. She does this 5 days a week, so in one week, she meditates for \(30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week}\). Over 4 weeks, she meditates for \(150 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 600 \text{ minutes}\).

She also practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so in one week, she practices yoga for \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week}\). Over 4 weeks, she practices yoga for \(300 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ minutes}\).

"To find out how big Octavia's quilt will be, we need to add up the fabric from all the t-shirts she uses.

1. Small t-shirts: Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet, and she uses 11 of them.
   - So, \(3 \times 11 = 33\) square feet from small t-shirts.

2. Medium t-shirts: Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet, and she uses 8 of them.
   - So, \(4 \times 8 = 32\) square feet from medium t-shirts.

3. Large t-shirts: Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet, and she uses 6 of them.
   - So, \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet from large t-shirts.

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, a small sunflower has:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. So, we need to find 50% of 36 and add it to 36:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{50}{100} \times 36 = 18 \]
\[ \text{So, a large sunflower has } 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, we add the seeds from both sunflowers:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

So, the total number of seeds is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"Nate's dog digs 6 holes every day. For 14 days, the dog digs:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he fills 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

To fill 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, it takes:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, it takes:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half of that, so Igor got \(16 \div 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, and Igor got 2 more than that, so Igor got \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, but some were lost. Let's say Igor brought \(x\) beakers. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

So, we can write the equation:
\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]
\[24 + x = 29\]
\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers. Since Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, the number of beakers lost is:
\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."

   \]
   So, each watermelon cost $1.60.

2. Next, the vendor sold each watermelon at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% to the cost price. We can do this by multiplying the cost price by 1.25 (which is the same as adding 25%):
   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00

1. The radiator costs $400, but he gets it at 80% off. That means he only pays 20% of the price.
2. To find 20% of $400, we do:
   \[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]
   So, the radiator costs $80 after the discount.

3. The mechanic charges $50 for each hour of work. It takes 3 hours to install the radiator.
4. To find the total cost for the mechanic, we do:
   \[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]
   So, the mechanic charges $150.

5. Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic:
   \[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{230}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total.
2. These animals are either chickens or cows.
3. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.
4. All together, the animals have 70 legs.

Let's use some simple math to solve this:

- If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have \(20 \times 2 = 40\) legs.
- But we know they actually have 70 legs, which is 30 more legs than if they were all chickens.
- Each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, so the extra 30 legs must come from cows.
- If each cow gives us 2 extra legs, then the number of cows is \(30 \div 2 = 15\).

So, there are 15 cows. Since there are 20 animals in total, the number of chickens is:
\[20 - 15 = 5\]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we multiply 7 by 8:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

This means there are 56 slices of pizza in total.

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. That makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide 56 by 4:

\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \]

This means each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
