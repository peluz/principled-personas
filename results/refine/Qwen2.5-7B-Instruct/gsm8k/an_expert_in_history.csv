"To determine how much Janet makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks each day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs used for breakfast and baking muffins.
3. Multiply the remaining number of eggs by the price per egg.

Given:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
- She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.
- She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

First, calculate the total number of eggs used:
\[ 3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for baking)} = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, calculate the number of eggs remaining to be sold:
\[ 16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (used eggs)} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:

"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for Wendi's flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, which totals:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, we need to calculate the total distance he has covered and compare it to his initial distance from home.

1. **Initial Distance:**
   - John drives 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - Next, he drives 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home.

"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **First Month**: The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month**: The number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
3. **Third Month**: The downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 \times 0.70 = 126
   \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
\]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost, the annual revenue from selling lemons, and the annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. After selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) left.
2. After selling 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.
3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, and she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after that. Therefore, before selling at the orange house, she had \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10

"The problem involves a straightforward arithmetic calculation, but let's frame it within a historical context to align with the persona of an expert in history.

In the 19th century, shoe manufacturing and retailing were evolving industries. The cost of goods was often influenced by the materials used, labor costs, and market demand. Let's consider the scenario in this historical context.

Given:
- One pair of high heels costs $33.
- The other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is $66.
- The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots.

Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots. According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to establish the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, and their total age is 162, we can set up the following equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to identify the guesses made by Gunter's friends:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the number of hours John spends each week taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, given that she has a total of 110 coins and 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"The question provided does not align with the historical expertise persona. However, if we interpret the question in a historical context, we can consider the scenario as a hypothetical economic situation in a historical period. For instance, let's assume this scenario takes place in the 1980s when video games were becoming popular.

John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?

To solve this, we first calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to analyze the information provided and apply basic principles of distance, time, and speed.

1. **Distance and Time Analysis:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.
   - He runs 3 days a week.
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

2. **Calculating Total Distance:**
   - Let \( v \) be John's running speed in miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day: \( 3v \) miles.
   - Distance on each of the other two days: \( 1.5v \) miles.
   - Total distance in a week: \( 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \) miles.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Given that the total distance is 60 miles:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

4. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Dana's speeds and the time she spends running and walking. Given that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and this is half her running speed, her running speed is 6 miles per hour. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of her 6-hour period running and two-thirds walking. Therefore, the time spent running is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
The time spent walking is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance covered during each activity:
- Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
- Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"In the context of historical knowledge, the scenario involving the great dragon Perg and Polly's ability to throw the gold javelin can be analyzed through the lens of medieval warfare and archery techniques.

Given that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we can calculate the throwing distance as follows:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the initial number of pieces minus the remaining pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can consume given your daily calorie target and current calorie intake, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate the grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips contains 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is approximately 48 grams. 

**Answer: 48 grams**"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Given that Harry slept 9 hours and James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the number of hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to consider the volume loss and the number of tomatoes per can. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce, resulting in 8 ounces of sauce. Freda's batch produced 32 ounces of sauce, so we calculate the number of cans used as follows:

\[
\text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
\]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[
\text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the historical context and the dynamics of traffic jams, which have been a concern for urban planners and historians for decades. In this scenario, we are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, avoiding the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam over the 30-minute period is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion based on the rate at which the fog bank moves.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We need to find the time \( x \) it will take to cover 42 miles.

Using the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \):
\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"To solve the problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Pieces**: The total number of jigsaw pieces is 1000.

2. **Pieces Placed by Poppy**: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   Therefore, 750 pieces are left.

4. **Pieces Placed by Poppy's Mom**: Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy's Mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   Therefore, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\)."

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can use the information provided and set up an equation based on the total hours of TV watched.

Frankie's TV watching schedule is as follows:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, totaling 2 hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes, totaling 1.5 hours.
- Friday: 2 hours (2 one-hour episodes).

Let \( x \) represent the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours.

The total hours of TV watched can be expressed as:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"The problem presented involves a series of proportional relationships between the capacities of phones and the number of ducks in a photograph. Given the context of this task, it is important to clarify that the historical context or expertise in history is not directly relevant to solving this mathematical problem. However, we can still provide a clear and concise solution.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- \( D \) as the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we express the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber she has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought:
- For the 2x4x10 boards: 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 2x4x10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For the 4x4x10 boards: 5 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 4x4x10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber:
- The price for the 2x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
  \[
  \text{Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The price for the 4x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.
  \[
  \text{Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards} = 5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \text{Total selling price} = 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = 270 - 180 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."

"The problem presented involves calculating the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, given their initial salaries and subsequent percentage increases. However, the context of the question does not align with historical expertise. Nonetheless, I will provide the solution based on the given data.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

"The problem presented involves basic arithmetic and cost calculations, which, while not directly related to historical expertise, can be approached with a structured and logical method.

Given:
- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
- Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

First, calculate the cost of a watermelon:
\[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the cost of an orange:
\[ \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for each item:
- Total cost for watermelons: \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \)
- Total cost for peppers: \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \)
- Total cost for oranges: \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \)

Finally, sum these amounts to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[ \boxed{880} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps carefully:

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. This means:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. This leaves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we start by noting his expenditure in May, which is $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Adding the expenditures of both months gives us the total expenditure:

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Thus, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is \(\boxed{940}\)."
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred, we need to calculate the total number of rides they took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of roller coaster rides:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Total roller coaster rides = 2 (Pam) + 4 (Fred) = 6 rides.

Next, let's calculate the number of luge rides:
- Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each.
- Total luge rides = 2 (Pam) + 2 (Fred) = 4 rides.

Now, let's find the total number of rides:
- Total rides = 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (luge) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
- Total tickets = 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Given the historical context and the task at hand, we can analyze the problem from a historical perspective, focusing on the progression of distances walked by Walt over the three days.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:
\[41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is \(\boxed{13}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships given and the total number of bees to find the number of worker bees. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( Q \) = number of queen bees
- \( B \) = number of baby bees
- \( W \) = number of worker bees

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. \( Q + B + W = 700 \) (total number of bees)

Substituting \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substituting \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

"To determine the total cost of John's purchases, we need to first categorize the items as either food or non-food and then apply the tax to the non-food items.

- Milk: Food item, costing $2.
- Eggs: Food item, costing $3.
- Light bulbs: Non-food items, costing $3.
- Cups: Non-food items, costing $3.
- Roach traps: Non-food items, costing $4.

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

There is a 10% tax on the non-food items, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
   \]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
   \]

Converting cents to dollars:

"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we need to work through the sequence of events step by step, starting from the end and moving backward.

1. After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. This means before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
2. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third. So, if \(y\) is the number of fries before the raccoon, then \(\frac{1}{3}y = 6\). Therefore, \(y = 6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
3. Before the pigeons ate, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries (since three pigeons each ate 3 fries).
4. Before the seagull ate, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries (since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and Dave ate 14 fries).
5. Before Dave ate, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries (since Dave ate 14 fries).

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we can break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

3. Calculate the total length of the baguettes in inches.
4. Sum the lengths from steps 1, 2, and 3 to get the total length in inches.
5. Convert the total length from inches to feet.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\)
2. Chocolate croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\)
3. Baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\) (since each baguette is 2 feet long, and \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches)

Now, sum the lengths:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Convert the total length to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."

"The question involves calculating the future cost of a bag of marbles given a specific rate of increase over time. However, as an expert in history, my domain of expertise does not directly pertain to financial calculations. Nonetheless, I can provide a structured response based on the given information.

Given:
- Original price of a bag of marbles: \$20
- Price increase: 20% every two months
- Time period: 36 months

To find the cost after 36 months, we can use the formula for compound interest:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( P_0 = 20 \) (original price)
- \( r = 0.20 \) (rate of increase)
- \( n = 18 \) (number of two-month periods in 36 months)

Substituting the values:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Now, calculate the final price:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"In the context of historical economics and valuation, the problem can be analyzed through the lens of commodity valuation and historical pricing. Given the historical context, let's assume the values provided are reflective of a specific period in history.

1. **Red Cars**: Historically, the cost of a red car in a specific period might be $4. This could represent a toy car from the early 20th century, for instance.
2. **Action Figures**: The cost of an action figure is given as $5. This could represent a popular toy from the mid-20th century.
3. **Doll**: The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which would be $15.

To find the total worth of all the toys, we sum up the individual values:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Adding these values together:
\[ \$20 + \$15 + \$15 = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"Given the budget constraints and the items Elvira intends to purchase, let's analyze the situation from a historical and economic perspective.

Elvira has a budget of €1500, which she has received as a donation from her family. She plans to buy a computer and several accessories. The items and their costs are as follows:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1090 + 157 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break down the addition:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 157 = 1404 \]
\[ 1404 + 74 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 102 = 1580 \]

The total cost of the items is €1580. Since Elvira's budget is only €1500, she will exceed her budget by €80. Therefore, she will not have any money left for clothing.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor provides her with a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply basic algebraic principles. Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum the legs from all the creatures:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Since Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two's age is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first calculate her total minimum monthly payment:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the amount Jessica pays in a year is \boxed{18000}."

"To address the problem from a historical perspective, we need to understand the context and the probabilities involved in the scenario. However, the scenario itself does not have a direct historical context, so we will focus on the mathematical probabilities and then interpret them in a historical framework.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"The question involves a distribution problem related to straw among different types of rodents. However, as an expert in history, my primary focus would be on the historical context and significance of such practices rather than the numerical solution. 

Given the problem, we can deduce the following:

1. **Rat Distribution**: 
   - 15 rats in total (since 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats).
   - These 15 rats are distributed equally among 3 cages (15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage).

2. **Hamster Distribution**:
   - 10 cages of hamsters, each receiving 5 pieces of straw (10 cages * 5 pieces = 50 pieces).

3. **Rabbit Distribution**:
   - 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distribution**:
   - 160 pieces of straw in total (50 for hamsters + 20 for rabbits + 90 for rats = 160 pieces).

The question specifically asks for the number of rats in each cage. Based on the calculations:

- The number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued each month and add it to the principal amount. Given the monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest to find the final amount.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) periods with compound interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( n \) periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the interest rate per period.
- \( n \) is the number of periods the money is invested or borrowed for.

Here, \( P = 100 \), \( r = 0.02 \), and \( n = 3 \).

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to analyze the financial transactions and apply basic algebra. Let's denote the number of bags by \( x \).

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars.
   - The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The revenue from selling the bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.
   - So, we have the equation: \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   \[
   8x = 400

   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"To determine how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of Tickets:**
   The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair.

2. **Cost of Food:**
   They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]

3. **Cost of Rides:**
   Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   Adding up all the costs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102
   \]

5. **Cost per Friend:**
   Since there are three friends, each friend pays:
   \[
   \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{102}{3} = 34
   \]

Thus, each friend paid \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the number of peaches John collects, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the rate at which he collects peaches.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly insect consumption for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly consumption into a daily consumption.

Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the daily consumption is:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"To determine the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, considering the planting and chopping, and the subsequent death of 30% of the trees, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at the end of Sunday.

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to consider the weight of each type of candy and then sum these weights.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- There are 80 candied apples.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic algebra, which is a fundamental tool in historical and mathematical analysis. Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens, and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens. According to the problem:

1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

"The problem presented does not align with historical expertise or knowledge. However, based on the numerical information provided, we can solve the problem as follows:

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply historical reasoning and mathematical principles to understand the dynamics of the pools' water levels over time.

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours to afford the shoes and the belt."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first calculate the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed. The additional amount is:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Given the historical context of floral arrangements, we can analyze the composition of the vase. Initially, there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as 4 + 7 = 11. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years and then calculate their average age.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years:
- Harriet's age will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

The average age of the three in three years is:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to use the information provided and apply basic arithmetic. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Naomi's Points**: 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Points**: 10 more than half of Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \text{ points}
   \]
3. **Brianna's Points**: 17 points more than Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, we know the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \text{ points}
\]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. The amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:

"Given the historical context of travel methods and their evolution, let's analyze the scenario. Historically, bus travel has been a common and reliable method for long-distance journeys, while car travel, especially in the early 20th century, was more flexible but could be less consistent due to road conditions and fewer vehicles.

In this case, Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which takes 6 days. Historically, such a journey by bus would have been a significant undertaking, often involving multiple stops and overnight stays. The return trip by car, which takes half the time, would have been more efficient once cars became more widespread and reliable.

Thus, the total travel time for the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:
\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"The question pertains to calculating the percentage chance of picking a water type Pokemon card from James's collection after some changes. Given the context of history, we can frame this problem in a way that aligns with historical data and reasoning.

James initially has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The probability of picking a water type card is:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"

"The problem presented involves a series of calculations based on the harvesting of watermelons over a period of time. However, as an expert in history, my primary focus would be on the context and historical significance of such agricultural practices rather than the numerical calculations themselves.

Given the scenario, we can analyze the historical context of watermelon cultivation and harvesting practices. Watermelons, native to Africa, have been cultivated for thousands of years, with evidence of their cultivation dating back to ancient Egypt. The process of harvesting and managing crops has evolved significantly over time, reflecting advancements in agricultural techniques and tools.

In the context of the problem, the historical aspect would involve understanding the methods and practices used by farmers in different historical periods to manage their crops. For instance, the use of percentages to determine the readiness of crops for harvest reflects a more modern approach to agriculture, which has roots in the scientific and industrial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

To directly answer the numerical part of the question, we can follow the calculations:

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   So, the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   So, the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical reasoning to understand the context and constraints provided.

Given:
- There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish in them.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cookies each ate on Monday and Tuesday.
2. Sum the total number of cookies for each person.
3. Convert the total number of cookies into calories.
4. Find the difference in calories consumed.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

Now, we convert the total number of cookies into calories. Since each cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:

"To determine the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the remaining percentage of the redwood after the termites have eaten.
3. Calculate the weight of the remaining redwood.

First, we know that each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. The redwood is 200 feet tall, so it consists of:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

The weight of the remaining redwood is:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply basic algebra, which is a fundamental skill in historical analysis and mathematical history.

Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between speed, distance, and time. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the historical context and the numerical relationships given. Ali has won 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less, which means Izzy has 17 medals. Together, they have:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

The problem states that the total number of medals they have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out. Then:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to distribute the chocolate bars among the adults and children based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Chocolate Bars Calculation:**
   \[
   8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

2. **Chocolate Bars for Adults:**
   \[
   4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Chocolate Bars for Children:**
   \[
   40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

4. **Chocolate Bars per Child:**
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
   \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine Susan's earnings, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into the 10-minute intervals for which she is paid.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She takes a half-hour break, so her actual working time is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Convert the working time into minutes:
   \[
   2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals}
   \]
5. Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
   \[
   15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount Susan earns for the online task is \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"In the context of historical games and points systems, let's analyze the scenario with a historical perspective. The game described can be seen as a simplified version of medieval tournament points systems, where participants earn points based on their performance and achievements.

After the first three rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 42 points.

In the fourth round, a rule is applied where players get an extra point if they have over 20 points:
- Mike, with 21 points, gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim, with 18 points, does not get an extra point.
- Tony, with 42 points, gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Summing up the points after the fourth round:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points of all three players are:
\[ 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
\(\boxed{83}\)"

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.

Rice consumed per meal by the household = 5 members * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg per meal.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

Rice consumed per day = 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:

Rice consumed per week = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

Number of weeks = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the final cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to account for the sequence of bids and the increment in each bid. The bids start at $200 and increase by $50 for each subsequent bid. Carmen bids after each of the three other bidders, making a total of four bids.

1. The first bid (opening bid) is $200.
2. The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The fourth bid (Carmen's final bid) is $300 + $50 = $350.

To find the total amount Carmen spends, we sum these bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 = 1100 \]

Thus, the desk costs Carmen:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To determine the annual cost John incurs for the driving service, we need to calculate the total miles driven and the associated costs, as well as the annual bonus.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven annually is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:

"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. Thus, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, produces two pages on the front and two pages on the back, making a total of four pages per piece of paper.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages produced per piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Given the scenario, Annika initially brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which amounts to $25. Additionally, she spent an extra $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?

To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we first calculate his weekly earnings:

1. Daily earnings: \(10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day}\)
2. Weekly earnings (without bonus): \( \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week}\)
3. Weekly earnings (with bonus): \( \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week}\)

Since April typically has 4 weeks, we calculate his total earnings for the month:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{3200}\)"

"Given the context of the question and the persona of an expert in history, we can interpret the problem as a historical analogy. Joey's weight loss can be seen as a historical event that occurs over a period of time, and Sandy's weight loss is a similar event but spread out over a different timeline.

Historically, if Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, this can be seen as a rate of 2 pounds per week. Sandy, needing 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight, is essentially mirroring Joey's total weight loss but over a longer period. This can be likened to a historical process where the outcome is the same, but the timeline is different.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

**Final Answer:**
4 weeks"

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of players on the defense. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."

   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we can use the trade ratio provided. According to the trade ratio, 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. If the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

\(\boxed{14}\)"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical context to understand the distribution and payment of programmers in the company. Given the constraints and the historical context of computer programming roles, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Determine the Number of Junior Programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Therefore, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the Number of Senior Programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

3. **Calculate the Monthly Payment to Junior Programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

4. **Calculate the Monthly Payment to Senior Programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \) per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to senior programmers is \( 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \).

5. **Calculate the Total Monthly Payment to All Programmers:**
   - The total payment to all programmers is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers.
   - Therefore, the total payment is \( 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"To determine the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and adjust the number of lollipops accordingly:

"To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs and then find the difference.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A).

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his remaining money on gumballs.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{x}{2} = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money spent on candy:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount spent on candy = $6.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Therefore, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine Carver's son's age, we can set up the equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the age of Carver's son. According to the problem, Carver, who is 45 years old, is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then multiply it by the number of trips per day. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city back to the first city (since it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two segments).

The total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

\[
\boxed{20}

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing needed is \(\boxed{23}\) pounds."
"To determine the total time John's trip took, we need to calculate the time for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

"The problem presented involves a series of sales transactions over a weekend, which can be analyzed through a historical lens to understand economic trends and consumer behavior. However, the core of the question is a straightforward arithmetic problem.

Let's break down the sales day by day:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

The total number of pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

"To address the problem using historical context and expertise, we can draw parallels to the historical development of energy usage and conservation. However, the core of the question is a straightforward calculation of energy savings.

Given that Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]
Converting to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh} \]

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the new daily consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]
Converting to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
\[ 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kWh} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh} \]

Over 30 days, the total savings is:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 4 zebras in total. The average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[\frac{88}{4} = 22\]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for Tyson's muffaletta sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \(\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach, leveraging historical and mathematical reasoning.

1. **Initial Corn and Cannoli Count:**
   - According to historical records, Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
   - Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, the initial number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **New Cannoli Count:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, increasing the total to \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Corn Count:**
   - Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is \(60 - 40 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the new number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.

"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to consider the given probabilities and the total number of candles produced.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical context to understand the distribution of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and humps to determine the number of dromedaries in the herd.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

1. **First 4 Days:**
   Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   Tom traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   \[
   800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next Day:**
   Tom did not travel at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second Week:**
   Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. Subtracting the 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats remaining on the rock.
4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).
5. Subtracting the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left, we get \(30 - 18 = 12\) cats remaining on the rock.

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."

   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years total 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112

   10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

Adding these capacities together gives the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[
240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[
\boxed{570}

"To determine the number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the specific details provided:

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each homemade bird feeder, which Lillian made, attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We can now calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

\[90 + 60 = 150\]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Adding these costs together, the total cost of the dinner is:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to consider the information given and apply basic arithmetic and historical context regarding the value of items and transactions.

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

Thus, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To address the problem, let's break it down using historical and logical reasoning:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was instructed to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18) were to have two hotdogs each, which means \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 18 guests were to have one hotdog each, which means \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 18 = 54\).

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - The first 18 guests each had 2 hotdogs, consuming \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests each wanted 1 hotdog.
   - Therefore, these 22 guests need \(22 \times 1 = 22\) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \(36 + 22 = 58\).

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. We add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The items include:

- A set of pot and pans for $120.00
- A set of mixing bowls for $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each, totaling $25.00

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to purchase. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these amounts together, we get:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has a total of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, which sums to:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Prince Walter, wielding a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Thus, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:

\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical context to understand the value of money over time. However, the problem itself does not require historical knowledge but rather straightforward calculations. Let's break it down:

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05.
3. Therefore, he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.
4. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, which totals 3 * $0.40 = $1.20.
5. The remaining amount spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
6. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

Thus, the number of candy bars George bought is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we start by calculating the number of lollipops Ray shared. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to distribute these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Thus, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"The cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces. Each piece therefore weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they consume:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the distribution of oranges among the participants. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

These oranges are to be shared equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people. To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Thus, each person will get 7 oranges. The correct answer is:

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions used.
2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Sum the costs of the onions and beef stock to get the total cost.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's go through each step:

1. Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
   \]

3. He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
   \]

4. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   \[
   \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
   \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
   \[
   \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider the travel times and the additional time Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne.

1. Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's, which is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, Bernadette needs to account for her 16-minute travel time and the additional 5 minutes she wants to arrive early. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave \(16 - 4 + 5 = 17\) minutes earlier than Wayne.

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Given that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

The difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth is:
\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The correct answer is:

   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time James took for each segment of the triathlon and then determine the time for the run.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is:
170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Next, we calculate the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so:
  \[
  40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Bike ride: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so:
  \[
  80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. The total time for James is:
\[
36 + 85 + x = 180
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
121 + x = 180
\]
\[
x = 180 - 121
\]
\[
x = 59
\]

Therefore, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

\[
\boxed{59}

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for Bob's 10 raised beds. Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

"To solve this problem, we can use historical reasoning and mathematical analysis. Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Answer: 38**"
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we can break down the problem into simpler calculations.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{112}\)."

\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to set up an equation and solve for the number of insects found by each person. Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \).

According to the problem:
1. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
3. The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.

We can write the equation for the total number of insects as:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the amount each used and then sum these amounts.

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost-effectiveness of the wood pieces. Each 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while each 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Given Frederick has $24 to spend, we should calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood.

First, let's calculate the number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]
Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, so:

"In the context of historical economic practices, the problem can be analyzed through the lens of medieval trade and property valuation. During the medieval period, the relationship between a house and a lot was often dictated by the economic status and resources of the owner. If we consider a scenario where a house and a lot cost $120,000 and the house is valued three times as much as the lot, we can apply similar proportional reasoning to understand the distribution of costs.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

"The question pertains to Ada's electric consumption and its cost, but as an expert in history, I can provide a refined response that aligns with historical context and knowledge, though the specific numerical answer is not directly related to historical expertise. However, I will provide the numerical answer as requested.

Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. If she adds a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, her total daily consumption will be 14 kilowatts per hour. Assuming a 24-hour day, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her weekly consumption before adding the new device is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50. Therefore, her weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$} \]

Her weekly electric bill after adding the new device is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$} \]

The difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ 3528 \, \text{\$} - 3024 \, \text{\$} = 504 \, \text{\$} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can start by understanding the rate at which one person can paint. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house. 

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting days into hours:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\)
- Total chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[84 + 88 = 172\]

The correct answer is:
\(\boxed{172}\)"
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the additional amount of money Tom would have if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many additional CDs he could buy with that extra money.

Given:
- Cost of one CD = $4
- Total amount paid = $48

First, we find the cost of the headphone set:
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we determine how many additional CDs Tom could buy with the $44:
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the specific weeks where he worked out for more than 4 hours.

Given:
- Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for 2 consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week, and 1 week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and apply the given conditions step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. The number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. The number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin and then find the difference between their ages.

1. **Determine Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Current Age:**
   - Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Determine the Age Difference:**
   - The age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"In the context of historical economic transactions, let's analyze the given scenario:

Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less than the computer, which is $700. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. Therefore, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. 

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"In the context of the scavenger hunt activity, each boy brought back 60 seashells. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To determine how many vlogs Emma should make in the fourth week to meet her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - Original bill: $50
   - Tip: 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10
   - Total bill including tip: $50 + $10 = $60

2. **Determine how the bill is split:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays: $60 / 2 = $30

Therefore, you end up paying \(\boxed{30}\)."
"The problem presented does not align with historical expertise or knowledge. However, if we interpret the task as a straightforward mathematical problem, we can solve it as follows:

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we can use the principles of historical economic distribution and proportional division, which were common in various historical contexts, such as the distribution of wealth or resources among individuals or groups.

Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the ages of his sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, making the second son 8 years old. Therefore, the total number of candles needed is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\). Thus, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.

The total cost is then calculated by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the information provided and apply historical and mathematical reasoning.

First, let's calculate the reading time and pages read in the first week. Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can determine her reading rate in pages per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given relationships and the total number of jelly beans to find the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( R = 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( G = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed the height of Mark's window, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height each day. We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) is greater than 20 feet.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( h(n) \). The height can be expressed as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, we simplify the inequality:
\[ 2^n > \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Now, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can test successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  \[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]
  (16 is not greater than 20)

- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
  \[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
  (32 is greater than 20)

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is 3. Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the remaining cost of his dental work, we first calculate the total cost and then the remaining amount after the deposit.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The additional cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already put down a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \).

Given that George makes \$15 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn \$3900 is:

\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the number of hours George needs to work is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"In the context of triangle geometry, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle and another is three times the smallest angle, we can set up the following equation to find the measure of the angles:

Let the smallest angle be \(x\). Then the angles are \(x\), \(2x\), and \(3x\). The sum of these angles is:

\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[6x = 180\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Thus, the angles are \(30\) degrees, \(60\) degrees, and \(90\) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is \(90\) degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to convert all his coins into their equivalent value in nickels, as each gumball costs one nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equivalent to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equivalent to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equivalent to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels remain as 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equivalent to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equivalent to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**
69"
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we can use the following calculations based on the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Next, we add the number of legs from all the pets together:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa and then calculate their combined output over 12 hours.

First, let's determine Ruiz's hourly production rate. Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his hourly rate is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Marissa's hourly production rate. Marissa produces \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Ruiz produces in an hour, so:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total production for each over 12 hours:
- Ruiz's total production in 12 hours:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]
- Marissa's total production in 12 hours:
\[ 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total production:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:
\[ \boxed{1260} \]"

   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"To determine Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. For the first four hours:
   - He sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
   - Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
   - Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

2. For the next two hours:
   - He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
   - Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.

3. Total earnings over 6 hours:
   - Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:

"The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 120 washings. If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?

To determine the cost per pump, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in history, the scenario provided does not align with historical context or expertise. However, if we were to interpret this as a hypothetical economic scenario within a historical context, we can analyze it as follows:

Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out have a price of $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25 with a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35 with no discount mentioned, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost before tax:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50 and the total cost is $52.50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he cannot make the purchase with the given budget.

Given the constraints and the historical context, the answer is that Joe will have:
\[ \boxed{0} \]
Joe will have no money left and will be short by $2.50."

"The problem presented involves calculating the total cost of a research project over a period of time, with different funding rates for different phases. Given the context of historical research, we can apply principles of financial management and historical cost accounting to solve this problem.

1. **Initial Funding and Duration:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Research Duration:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which means the total duration is 50 months.
   - Therefore, the remaining duration after the first 5 months is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.

3. **Funding Rate for the Remaining Period:**
   - The cost for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding.
   - Initial funding per month: $100,000.
   - Increased funding per month: \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\).
   - Cost for the remaining 45 months: \(150,000 \times 45 = 6,750,000\).

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[
\boxed{54}
\]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. Converting this to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. The height difference is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year. Converting this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[
\text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
\]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}
\]"
"In the context of historical analysis, we can draw parallels to the given scenario by examining the demographic shifts and social dynamics of a specific historical period. For instance, during the early 20th century, there was a significant increase in women's participation in various sports and activities, including surfing. However, the data provided in the question reflects a specific condition where only 25% of the surfers can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, and 60% of those who can stay upright are women.

Given these conditions, we can calculate the number of men who can stay upright. If 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, that means 25 riders can stay upright. Since 60% of these 25 riders are women, the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"In the context of historical pricing and valuation, the scenario provided can be analyzed through the lens of historical economic conditions and the value of precious metals and gemstones throughout history. 

Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel in the modern context is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}
\]"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Given that Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed is:

\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

   \]
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which means:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish Tommy caught} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to use the given information and apply basic algebra.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes attended:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Then, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Finally, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

"To determine the total cooking time for the ingredients Finley bought, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - Given: 30 minutes.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - Given: 20 minutes more than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - Given: Half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice: \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and legs of the animals on Lee's farm. Let's define the variables:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

To solve this system, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

The increase in cost is:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2.

So, the total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they shared the total amount equally.

First, let's establish the amount of money each person has based on the given information:

1. **Aurelia's Money**: It is given that Aurelia has $120.
2. **Kassidy's Money**: Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia. Therefore, Kassidy's money is:
   \[
   \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Rayna's Money**: Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna's money is:
   \[
   \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money they have together:
\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

"Given the historical context and the structured nature of the question, we can analyze the data as follows:

Christina recorded her mood over 30 days, with the following breakdown:
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 10

The specific sequence of days is:
- First 8 days: Good
- Next 8 days: Bad
- Following 8 days: Neutral
- Next 3 days: Good, Neutral, Good

From this, we can see that:
- The first 8 days are already accounted for as good days.
- The next 3 days include 2 good days (Good, Neutral, Good).

Thus, the total number of good days is:
- Initial good days (first 8 days) = 8
- Additional good days (next 3 days) = 2
- Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

Since the total number of good days recorded is 12, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 - 10 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

"To determine the original length of Shania's dress, we can use the information provided and apply historical and mathematical reasoning.

Given:
- The final length of the dress is 140 cm.
- The dress was extended by 50% of its original length.
- An additional 20 cm was added with a lace trim.

Let \( x \) be the original length of the dress. According to the problem, the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which can be expressed as \( 0.5x \). Adding the 20 cm lace trim, the equation becomes:

"To determine the time it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, let's establish the mowing rates:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Adding these times together gives the total time:

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left(20 \text{ coins} \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), the total number of coins Neil saves is:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the total savings of Rong and Neil together, we get:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil together after ten years is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the vet visit and then calculate how much money John will have left after the payment.

First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let the total bill be \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"The question provided does not align with historical expertise or knowledge. However, if we interpret the task as a request to solve a mathematical problem related to historical pricing or economic conditions, we can proceed as follows:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices and then determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends.

1. **Total Number of Pizza Slices:**
   Each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices.
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices per friend}
   \]
   Therefore, for three friends:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices Eaten by the Other Two Friends:**
   Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza.
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices per friend}

   \[
   2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   Adding the slices eaten by all five friends:
   \[
   24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Slices Left:**
   Subtracting the total slices eaten from the total number of slices:
   \[
   60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 

First, we determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The problem states that the dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches and then use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, convert 8 feet and 4 inches into inches:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. The equation becomes:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Final numerical answer:
86 glasses and 42 plates"
"The problem presented involves a series of trades and conversions, which can be analyzed through the lens of historical trade practices and economic systems. However, the specific context of historical trade does not significantly alter the mathematical solution. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversion Rates:**
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 27 (small) + 20 (large) + 60 (small) = 107

**Final Answer:**
Lorraine has 107 buttons by the end."

"To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the total number of field trip shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem based on the given information:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's sum up all the shirts:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"To determine the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, we can use the information provided and apply basic algebra.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house. According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"The difference in scores between Ava and Emma can be calculated based on the given points system and the differences in their performance. 

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries, and finishes 4 seconds slower. The points system is as follows:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on
- 5 points for each berry collected
- 30 points for each second left on the timer

Given these points, the additional points Ava earns are:
- From enemies: \(8 \times 10 = 80\) points
- From berries: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points
- From time: \(-4 \times 30 = -120\) points (since she finishes 4 seconds slower, this is a deduction)

Summing these up, the total additional points Ava earns are:
\[80 + 15 - 120 = -25\]

However, the question asks for the difference in their scores, not the net additional points. Since the points for time are already included in the base score, the difference in scores is simply the sum of the additional points from enemies and berries:
\[80 + 15 = 95\]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to set up and solve a system of equations. Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \(W\).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\), we get:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = 5 - 17\]

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we need to analyze the given relationships between the ingredients and the total volume of the salt scrub.

Let's define the variables:
- \( z \) = amount of citrus zest in ounces
- \( f \) = amount of fragrance in ounces (same as citrus zest, so \( f = z \))
- \( s \) = amount of salt in ounces
- \( u \) = amount of sugar in ounces (same as salt, so \( u = s \))
- \( o \) = amount of oil in ounces (twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \))

The total volume of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + f + s + u + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

From this equation, we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and the total volume is 10 ounces, we can solve for \( s \). If \( s = 1 \), then:
\[ z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \]

This satisfies the equation. Therefore, the amount of oil \( o \) is:
\[ o = 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we can break down the costs as follows:

"In the context of historical sports analysis, we can draw parallels between the performance of Sasha and Julie in their basketball games and the historical records of athletes in various sports. The scenario provided can be analyzed through the lens of historical sports performance, particularly focusing on the home court advantage and the impact of playing away.

In the first game, Sasha, having the home court advantage, scored 14 points. This performance can be compared to historical records where athletes often perform better in familiar environments. Julie, on the other hand, scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which is a common pattern in competitive sports where the home team often outperforms the away team.

For the second game, which was played at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game. This scenario reflects the historical trend where away teams often struggle to match the performance of home teams.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra to determine the number of Magic Cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards.
- Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.
- The total number of cards is 341.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \(3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\) cards.
- Becca has \(3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between speed, time, and distance, which are fundamental concepts in the study of motion and travel, a topic often explored in historical contexts, particularly in the works of ancient Greek mathematicians like Archimedes and Euclid.

Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross a highway, we can determine the total distance \(D\) as follows:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use the following calculation:

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. The farmer currently has 3 cows, producing a total of:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine how many students are good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Given the total number of students and the breakdown of those who are good at only one subject, we can calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects.

1. Total number of students: 20
2. Students good at math only: 5
3. Students good at English only: 8

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of students good at both subjects can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

To find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both subjects:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given relationships and algebraic equations to determine the ages of the individuals involved. Let's define the variables and relationships again:

1. Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
2. Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).
3. Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of the person asking the question (you) is \(\boxed{13}\)."

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta. 

First, let's determine the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount is:
\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. Therefore, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:
\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the given relationships to set up equations and solve for the number of books Fawn has.

Let's define:
- \( F \) as the number of books Fawn has.
- \( A \) as the number of books Anne has.
- \( S \) as the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
- \( A = F - 12 \)
- \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to analyze the information provided and apply basic arithmetic.

Given:
- Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.
- In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
- In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.

Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Then:
- The number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- The number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54J \]

To find the value of \( J \), we need to ensure that \( 80 - 54J \) is a non-negative integer. Testing the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"Given the scenario, let's analyze the situation from a historical perspective, focusing on the distribution and consumption of resources in a family setting during a specific historical period.

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. The family consists of Calvin (an adult), his wife (an adult), and their two children. Each family member will eat one bowl at the meal.

First, we need to determine the total number of bowls required for the family:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, it has enough soup for 4 adult bowls. After the family has eaten their bowls, we need to see if there is any leftover soup for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

The family consumes 4 bowls, and the pot originally had enough for 4 adult bowls. Therefore, there is no additional soup left for the children to have for lunch.

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can use historical and practical knowledge of material requirements for such items.

First, we calculate the material needed for the small masks. Historically, small masks require less material than large ones. Given that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, we can deduce that each small mask requires:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]
Thus, for 20 small masks, the material required is:
\[ 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the material needed for the large masks. Large masks historically require more material. Given that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material, we can deduce that each large mask requires:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]
Thus, for 8 large masks, the material required is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the material required for both types of masks, we get the total material needed:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply basic algebra, which is a fundamental skill in historical analysis and mathematical history.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age. According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Adding 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we can apply historical and practical knowledge of vehicle maintenance intervals. Historically, cars have required tune-ups at regular intervals to ensure optimal performance and longevity. In this case, Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles.

Given that Jon drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, we can calculate the total miles driven as follows:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since a tune-up is required every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by two, as they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, which sums up to 14 pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the remaining number of fruit pieces is 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to sum the participants from each activity. According to the given information:

- 6 students are playing tennis.
- Twice the number of students playing tennis are playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.
- 16 boys and 22 girls are playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Adding these numbers together, we get:
\[6 + 12 + 38 = 56\]

Therefore, the total number of students is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the profit made by the class from selling lollipops, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \(30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}\).

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5.
   - Total cost = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**
   - Profit = \(240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{47}\)."
"Given the context of the question and the persona of an expert in history, we can interpret the problem as a simple arithmetic exercise that aligns with historical population and consumption patterns. In historical terms, this problem reflects the daily consumption of resources by individuals, which is a common theme in studying the daily lives of people in various historical periods.

Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day, and Josh eats twice as much, which means he eats 4 slices per day. Together, they consume 6 slices of bread per day. A loaf of bread contains 24 slices. To determine how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the daily consumption:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"By applying historical context and understanding the passage of time, we can determine the number of months Martha has been collecting shells. Martha started collecting shells at age 5 and continued until her 10th birthday. This period spans 5 years. Given that a year consists of 12 months, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Therefore, the number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Given the historical context and the task at hand, we need to analyze the distribution of tea cups in a structured manner. Lana has 27 cups of tea, which she divides into 3 rows. Each row contains an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, and the remaining cups are used for cinnamon tea, totaling 15 cups.

First, we calculate the number of cups in each row:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

Each row has 9 cups. Since the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal in each row, we divide the 9 cups in each row by 2:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Thus, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to consider the time constraints and the total number of berries.

1. **Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and apply basic arithmetic operations. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half of this amount. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

The tank is then emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total calorie content of the mini pastries baked by Andrew, considering the calorie content of both the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
   - Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \)

The difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car is:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

\(\boxed{60}\)"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to account for all the other toys Sophie has and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

Given:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these numbers together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Peter's age given the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, and the relationships between their ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( Pa \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substituting the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

   \]

2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.

3. Maria's mom then gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given by Maria's mom is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ balloons}
   \]

4. Adding the initial balloons given by Maria and the additional balloons given by her mom, the total number of balloons is:
   \[
   8 + 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}

     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue generated by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines:**

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning is 17 hours total, so 17 - 12 = 5 hours).
- The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.
- Therefore, the cost for the additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.
- The total cost for Cameron's stay is \(1000 + 350 = 1350\) pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the 24-hour stay option:
- The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

"The question provided does not align with the historical expertise persona. However, if we were to interpret the question in a historical context, we could consider the economic and social conditions of a historical period. For instance, if we were to place this scenario in the context of the Industrial Revolution, we could analyze the working conditions and wages of the time.

Given the scenario, let's break it down:

1. **Earnings Calculation**: John earns 50 dollars an hour and works 6 hours in the week.
   \[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

2. **Expenses and Savings**:
   - John spends 50 dollars on gas.
   - He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.
   - He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.
   \[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

3. **Remaining Amount**:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step, considering the historical context and economic principles involved.

1. **Initial Purchase Cost:**
   James buys 10 CDs at $15 each.
   \[
   10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
   \]

2. **Discount Application:**
   James gets a 40% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60
   \]
   Therefore, the discounted cost is:
   \[
   \$150 - \$60 = \$90
   \]

3. **Selling the CDs:**
   James sells 5 of the CDs for $40 each.
   \[
   5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
   \]

4. **Net Outlay Calculation:**
   The net amount James is out is the initial discounted cost minus the money he received from selling the CDs.
   \[
   \$90 - \$200 = -\$110
   \]
   Since the result is negative, it indicates a profit of $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which in this context means the initial expenditure.

Therefore, the amount of money James was out is:

"In the context of historical analysis, the problem can be approached by understanding the distribution of points among Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Given that Bahati scored the most points and the specific differences in their scores, we can use historical problem-solving techniques to determine the points scored by each individual.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the information provided:

- 100 pages are stacked in 1 inch of paper.

\]

Therefore, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling in minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**

   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
   \]
3. Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
   \[
   16 - 6 = 10
   \]
4. The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of his measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
   \[
   24 + 10 = 34
   \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To address the problem, we need to calculate the number of unoccupied beds in a hospital with a capacity of 1000 beds after 2 weeks, given the initial occupancy and daily admissions.

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \(\boxed{100}\)."

"Given the historical context and the relationships described, we can determine Shawna's father's age through a series of proportional relationships. Historically, such relationships were often used to establish generational timelines in genealogical records.

1. Aliya's age is given as 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so his age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

Next, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of Pokemon caught by Stan. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.
- Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so the equation is:
  \[
  A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
  \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
\]
\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Adding 21 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:
\[
4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Now, we determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
- Therefore, the number of bottles needed is \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

The total cost of both cars is:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the information provided and then find their sum.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. Therefore, his dad's current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years. Therefore, his brother's current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[
\boxed{50}

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is 90.

\(\boxed{90}\)"
"To determine the number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of crawfish caught each day.
2. Sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days.
3. Divide the total amount by the serving size to find the number of servings.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we can break down the problem step by step.

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we start by noting that Sophie's boots are size 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]"

2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. Katherine has 5 baskets.

1. Total petunias needed: \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).
2. Total sweet potato vines needed: \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

The cost of each petunia is $3.00, and the cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.

3. Total cost for petunias: \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).
4. Total cost for sweet potato vines: \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the total amount spent:

5. Total cost: \(\$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00\).

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many roses can be planted, we need to calculate the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil for planting roses is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount she can spend on shoes in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with that total amount.

First, Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly salary for shoes:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, she sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. Over a year, this amounts to:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:
\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be completed sequentially, the total time required is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \boxed{45} minutes."
"The problem involves understanding the cooling and warming rates of an air conditioner over a specific period. Given the context of an air conditioner's operation and the room's natural warming rate, we can calculate the net temperature change.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To determine Bill's age when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to consider the orbital period of the comet and the information given about Bill's and his father's ages.

1. **Orbital Period and Age of Bill's Father:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Age of Bill When He Saw the Comet for the Second Time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Time Interval Between Sightings:**
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculating Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
2. Calculate the number of flights to France based on the given proportions.

From the problem, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes:
\[ 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ trips} \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means the remaining one-quarter of the flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 \div 2 = \frac{88}{8} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the howls of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous in minutes.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's find the total duration of their howls combined:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply basic arithmetic and historical reasoning to find the age of Wilfred.

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. Given:
\[ A = 3 \]
\[ B = 4 \]
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Given that \(H = 2 \times \text{Average age}\), we can substitute the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now, we know Helene's age is 10. Using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"In the context of historical distribution and sharing of resources, particularly in a family setting, we can draw parallels to the equitable division of goods. Given a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) dividing a watermelon, where each adult's share is twice that of each kid, we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

The total number of slices is \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. The correct answer is:

"The population of porcupines in the park is 50. Given that the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of baby porcupines born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Adding the initial population of porcupines to the total number of baby porcupines born in a year, we get the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the price per gallon.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

The volume of the pool in cubic feet is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

Finally, calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"

"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over two days and then determine the remaining capacity of the tank.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

   \[
   18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

The remaining capacity of the tank is \(\boxed{6000}\) gallons."
"The problem presented involves a scenario where a power bank's charge is decreasing over time. However, as an expert in history, my domain of expertise does not directly relate to the technical aspects of power banks or their charging mechanisms. Instead, I can provide a historical context or analogy that might help understand the concept of resource depletion over time.

In historical terms, the scenario can be likened to the decline of a resource over time, such as the gradual depletion of a kingdom's treasury or the reduction of a city's population over centuries. For instance, the Roman Empire experienced a gradual decline in its economic and military power over several centuries, much like a power bank losing charge over time.

To solve the specific problem mathematically, we would follow the steps outlined in the previous response. However, since my expertise lies in history, I will not provide the numerical solution but rather a historical analogy.

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park can be represented as \( x \). After 5 hours, the charge is \( x \times (0.91)^5 \), and after an additional 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \). Given that the final charge is 28%, we have:

\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{0.28}{(0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3} \]

Using the approximate values:

\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Thus:

\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.624032 \times 0.804357} \approx \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total hourly earnings from wages and tips.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate her weekly earnings.
4. Determine the number of weeks required to save the down payment.

Step 1: Calculate Janet's total hourly earnings.
\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Step 3: Calculate her weekly earnings.
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

Step 4: Determine the number of weeks required to save the down payment.
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[
\boxed{2}

"Given the context and the persona of an expert in history, the question about purchasing fruits does not align with the historical expertise. However, if we interpret this as a hypothetical scenario where historical economic conditions are considered, we can analyze the situation through a historical lens.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. The prices of the fruits are as follows:
- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\) dollars
- 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\) dollars
- 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\) dollars
- 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

The total cost of these fruits is:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

The remaining amount Jamaar has is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Thus, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

2. Determine how many packs Anne gave to her friends:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

3. Calculate the total number of sweets Anne gave to her friends:

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia uploaded, we first need to calculate the number of pictures per album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them evenly into 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ \text{Total portraits and selfies} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the number of guests in the hotel after the series of events, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Thus, the final number of guests in the hotel is \(\boxed{98}\)."

"In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

To solve this, we first categorize the questions:

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: \(40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
- Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- Average and difficult questions are equally divided: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) for each

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get \(75\%\) of the easy questions correct.
  \[
  0.75 \times 24 = 18
  \]
- Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Difficult questions: Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]

Now, we sum up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[
18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic algebra and historical context to understand the pricing and sales dynamics. Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

\(\boxed{12}\)"

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the mining capabilities of the dwarves and then scale it up to the required number of dwarves and days.

1. **Bare Hands Mining Rate**: One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. **Iron Pickaxe Mining Rate**: With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles, so one dwarf can mine \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.
3. **Steel Pickaxe Mining Rate**: With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so one dwarf can mine \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

Now, we need to calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over 30 days.

- **Daily Mining by 40 Dwarves**: \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.
- **Total Mining Over 30 Days**: \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich based on the given information. The store offers sandwiches in three different package sizes with known prices:

1. First package: 2 sandwiches for $3.
2. Second package: 4 sandwiches for $6.
3. Third package: 8 sandwiches, with the price to be determined.

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
\[
\text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
\]

Next, we verify this price per sandwich for the second package:
\[
\text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
\]

Since the price per sandwich is consistent, we can use this rate to find the cost of the third package:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"The question pertains to the probability of Marcus having to submit his homework, but as an expert in history, we can reframe this in a historical context. Let's consider a historical scenario where a similar situation might have occurred.

In the context of historical events, the probability of a substitute teacher not collecting homework can be likened to the probability of a significant event not occurring. For instance, if we consider the probability of a major political figure not making a critical decision, we can use historical data to estimate such probabilities.

1. **Probability of a substitute teacher not collecting homework (50% or 0.50):**
   - This can be compared to the probability of a significant political figure not making a critical decision due to unforeseen circumstances.

2. **Probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension (40% or 0.40):**
   - This can be compared to the probability of a significant event being postponed or delayed due to unforeseen circumstances.

3. **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension (20% or 0.20):**
   - This can be compared to the probability of a specific individual receiving a special dispensation or extension due to unique circumstances.

To find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework, we sum these probabilities:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.20 = 0.102 \]

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"To determine the average loss per race, we need to follow these steps:

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Win: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Loss: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit, which in this case is inches.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights is:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the principles of historical accounting and arithmetic, which were well understood in the medieval period. Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

Therefore, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra to determine the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to account for the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To solve this problem, we will follow the sequence of events and apply the changes to the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles required.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to consider the frequency of his laundry and the capacity of his washing machine.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps carefully, considering the historical context and the numerical aspects involved.

1. **Initial Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - This means Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Meatballs in Initial Order:**
   - Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. **Meatballs Eaten by Mark:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - The number of meatballs Mark ate is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) meatballs.

4. **Remaining Meatballs After Mark Ate:**
   - The number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate is \(28 - 16 = 12\) meatballs.

5. **Additional Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - The number of meatballs in the additional order is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

6. **Total Remaining Meatballs:**
   - The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(12 + 12 = 24\) meatballs.

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Given the historical context and the scenario presented, we can analyze the situation through the lens of logistics and historical transportation methods. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, transportation of goods like fertilizers was a significant challenge due to the limited availability of modern vehicles and infrastructure.

Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertilizers. Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. Historically, such issues were common due to the age and condition of the vehicles and the road conditions.

To calculate the total tons of fertilizers that reached the farmers, we first determine the number of trucks that failed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Thus, the number of trucks that successfully delivered their load is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertilizers, so the total tons of fertilizers that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertilizers that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"To determine the cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to consider the base fee and the additional cost per guest. The base fee for renting the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests, and each additional guest costs $6.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests who will attend the party:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- 4 people said they could not come.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza originally had and then calculate how much they have left after their expenditures.

First, let's consider Maggie:
- Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left.
- This means that $60 is three-quarters of her original amount.
- Let \( M \) be Maggie's original amount of money.
- We can set up the equation: \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\).
- Solving for \( M \): \( M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \).
- Therefore, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, let's consider Riza:
- Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left.
- This means that $60 is two-thirds of her original amount.
- Let \( R \) be Riza's original amount of money.
- We can set up the equation: \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\).
- Solving for \( R \): \( R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \).
- Therefore, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
- Maggie has $60 left.
- Riza has $60 left.
- Total amount of money left: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \).

Thus, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can use the information provided and apply basic arithmetic.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day, and in a week, it eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\). Therefore, in a week, the third monkey eats \(7x\) bananas.

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey:
\[70 + 98 + 7x = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[168 + 7x = 315\]
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7} = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 15 roses.
2. Determine the change Jenny receives.
3. Convert the change into quarters.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, the cost of one rose is:

\[ \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount amount from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount.

Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.
The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Step 3: Determine the discount amount from the original price.
The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount.
\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas.
2. Calculate the total cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually at $0.80 each.
3. Calculate the total cost if Jenny bought these bananas in bunches at $3.00 per bunch.
4. Subtract the total cost for bunches from the total cost for individual bananas to find the savings.

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Total bananas from bunches = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas
2. Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00
3. Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00
4. Money saved = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given to set up an equation. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years at this rate:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"The question provided does not align with the historical expertise persona. However, if we were to interpret the question in a historical context, we could consider the economic and social implications of bicycle sales in a historical setting. But since the question is purely numerical, let's focus on the calculation.

Given the numerical data and the persona of an expert in history, we can still provide the answer in a structured format, reflecting the historical context of bicycle sales.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes in a month, with the following breakdown:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half the price of an MTB)
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each

The total earnings can be calculated as follows:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: \(150 \times 450 = 67500\)
- Earnings from BMX bikes: \(45 \times 250 = 11250\)
- Earnings from MTB bikes: \(105 \times 500 = 52500\)

Summing these amounts gives the total earnings:
\[67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250\]

Thus, the total earnings from selling bicycles during that month are \(\boxed{131250}\)."
"The problem presented involves a simple arithmetic calculation, but from the perspective of an expert in history, we can interpret this in a broader context. Historically, the rate of hay production and pickup can be seen as a metaphor for the balance between production and consumption in agricultural societies.

Given:
- The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour.
- The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.
- The net increase in hay bales per hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.
- Over a 6-hour day, the total net increase is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:

\(\boxed{12}\)"
"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the additional learning time on the weekend.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes during the weekdays:
- John has 8 classes each weekday.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

Since John goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes}\]

Next, let's calculate the additional learning time on the weekend:
- John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday.
- The weekday class time is 1600 minutes.
- Therefore, the additional learning time on each day is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.
- Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total additional learning time for the weekend is:
\[100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, let's add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[\frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height after the first bounce.
3. Determine the height after the second bounce.

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Then, the ball bounces again to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given height differences step by step.

Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, the number of bags sold is:
\[ \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Since each bag is sold for $5, the total earnings are:
\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the meat was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. Therefore, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \( 2 \times 270 = 540 \) kilograms.
3. Before the velociraptors scavenged, the meat was half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the T-Rex ate, there were \( 2 \times 540 = 1080 \) kilograms.

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, and there are two of these walls, so the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 160\) square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, and there are two of these walls, so the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 80\) square feet. Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"The scenario presented involves a probability calculation based on the distribution of shaken and unshaken sodas. Given the context of the question and the expertise in history, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Initially, there are 12 sodas, with 3 being shaken and 9 being unshaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 2 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas remaining. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Expressing this probability as a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.
- The time is 3 hours.

Calculating the distance each train travels:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"The problem provided does not align with historical context or expertise, as it involves a modern scenario with specific numerical data. However, if we interpret this as a hypothetical scenario requiring an expert historical perspective, we can consider the following:

The scenario describes a modern wedding with a specific number of vehicles. In historical context, the number of vehicles and their capacity would have varied significantly depending on the time period and social status of the individuals involved. For instance, in medieval times, a wedding might have involved a few horses and carriages, while in the 19th century, carriages and possibly a few private carriages might have been used.

Given the modern context and the specific numbers provided, the calculation remains the same:

- Each bus carried 35 people.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- There were 12 buses.
- There were 20 cars.

Calculating the total number of people that the buses could carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Calculating the total number of people that the cars could carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church, based on the maximum capacity of the vehicles, is:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we can use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

**Answer: 2 minutes**"
"In the context of historical labor practices, the time spent by workers on breaks and lunch periods has varied significantly across different eras and industries. Historically, the standard workday has evolved from longer hours to the more modern 8-hour workday, which includes specific times for lunch and breaks.

Given the scenario where Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, we can calculate the total time spent on these activities over 5 days. Each day, Bobby spends a total of 60 minutes (30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for breaks) on these activities. Over 5 days, this amounts to 300 minutes, which is equivalent to 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days is:

\[

"To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we start by calculating the distance Micah ran. Given that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran \(\boxed{16}\) miles."
"To determine Sheila's new balance on her credit card, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- \( M \) as the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- \( C \) as the number of eggs Camden painted.
- \( S \) as the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the information, we have:
1. \( A = M \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)
3. \( C = S + 12 \)

First, substitute \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Since \( A = M \) and the total number of eggs painted is 56, we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns twice what Valerie earns, which is:
   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]
3. Their mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we find their combined salary:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]
   Then, their mother's salary is:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

"To determine the total time Grandma spends walking, we need to calculate the time spent on both the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Given: 40 minutes.

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so \( 40 = \frac{2}{v} \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

5. **Distance on the sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

6. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \) minutes.

7. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the historical context of temperature scales and the practical application of mixing temperatures.

Historically, temperature scales have evolved from various standards, but for this problem, we can use the Fahrenheit scale, which is commonly used in everyday temperature measurements.

Given:
- The temperature of the first mug is 33°F.
- The temperature of the second mug is \( T \)°F.
- Donny can only drink water if it is at least 40°F.
- He pours 4 ounces of water from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40°F:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68°F for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

   \[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

4. The cost per single bagel is:
   \[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps, considering the historical context and mathematical relationships provided.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the transactions and calculate the total earnings step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**

5. Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, we sum the eggs found by all participants:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical context to understand the scale of John's collection efforts.

1. **Determine the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

3. **Determine the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections per week = 1040 apartments \(\times\) 3 collections per apartment = 3120 collections.

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total earnings per week = 3120 collections \(\times\) $0.40 per collection = $1248.

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production pattern described:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{1650}
\]"
"To determine how much money Jack has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Sophia gave to Jack.
2. Add this amount to the initial amount Jack had.

Sophia gave Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100. Therefore, the amount Sophia gave is:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 from Sophia, we get:
\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Thus, Jack now has $120.

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given relationships and the total length of the ropes to find the length of the red rope. Let's define the lengths of the ropes as follows:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28, \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical context to understand the distribution and subsequent actions of the funds.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Equal Amount Given to Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount given to their little sister by both Ronnie and Rissa.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money.

3. **Equation for Rissa's Remaining Money:**
   - Rissa's remaining money is \(15 - x\).
   - According to the problem, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

4. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

5. **Calculating Ronnie's Remaining Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]

Thus, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and historical context to understand the distribution of paint colors in the mural. Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and half of it is yellow, we can deduce that 6 pints are yellow. The remaining 6 pints are equally divided among red, white, and purple paint.

Historically, the distribution of colors in such artistic works often reflects the cultural and artistic preferences of the time. In this case, the equal distribution of red, white, and purple paint suggests a balanced and harmonious design, which might be characteristic of a particular period or style.

To find the amount of red paint used, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 (since the three colors are equally distributed):

\[ \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we can break down the problem into several steps:

2. Calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms:
\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

3. Calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

4. Add the area of the rest of the house, which is given as 1000 square feet:
\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \text{ square feet} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can follow a step-by-step calculation:

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
3. Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1.

First, the special size box contains 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box has 100 pods, so the special size box has:

\[ 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. Therefore, the cost per pod is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps carefully, ensuring we account for each transaction and conversion accurately.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400

"The problem presented involves a scenario where a teacher uses a piece of chalk to write on a chalkboard. The teacher conserves chalk by using only 20% of it each day and recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday, the teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it, leaving 2.75 inches. We need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Chalk and Usage on Monday:**
   - Initial chalk length: 5 inches
   - Chalk used on Monday: 45% of 5 inches = 2.25 inches
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

2. **Daily Usage Calculation:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - Let \( C_n \) be the length of the chalk after \( n \) days.
   - The chalk length after each day can be calculated as \( C_{n+1} = C_n \times 0.80 \).

3. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling:**
   - We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.
   - Starting with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches:
     - After 1 day: \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches
     - After 2 days: \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches
     - After 3 days: \( C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \) inches
     - After 4 days: \( C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \) inches
     - After 5 days: \( C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \) inches

Since \( C_5 = 0.90112 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity. 

Given that one-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

And one-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Adding these together gives the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Determine the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

Step 1: The dentist drills 4 teeth.
Step 2: The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is \(4 + 7 = 11\).
Step 3: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
Step 4: The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up equations and solve for Colin's current age. Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27,000. Since each set of 100 books costs $500, the number of sets he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we can break down the problem using historical and practical knowledge of food distribution and consumption patterns.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices required for each type of pizza:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).
- The total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizza pies are required for each type of pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. To find out how many cheese pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pie: \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}\).
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pie: \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}\).

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}\].

The final answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"Given that Digimon celebrated its 20th anniversary, it means the series first aired 20 years ago. John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 8 years old at the time Digimon came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, Jim must have been 4 years old when Digimon first aired. 

To find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed since the series first aired to Jim's age at that time. Therefore, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

"To determine the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to account for the usage and replenishment of bandages over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)

Given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we need to adjust our calculation:
- The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), meaning they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\]

The correct answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional amount for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the amount of blood in ten sharks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of blood in one whale.
2. Calculate the amount of blood in one shark.
3. Multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten.

From historical and scientific data, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by ten:
\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the events as follows:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

Thus, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can follow these steps:

"To determine the number of fish with red and blue stripes, we start by calculating the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we find the number of remaining fish:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Of these remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes. Adding the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes gives:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes is:

\[

1. **Initial Count of Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the height of the house: Since the house is 7 times Mattison's height, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches}

2. Calculate the height of the first floor to the ceiling: This height is thrice Mattison's height, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Determine the height of the second floor: The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor. Therefore:
   \[
   180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Solving for \( h \):
   \[
   h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is \(\boxed{240}\) inches."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, given the constraints provided.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly made. According to the problem, Carly made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Thus, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost Karen would pay for her services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.
3. Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply basic algebra. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]

- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas Frog to return home is \(\boxed{15}\) minutes."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Determine the total cost based on the number of boxes.

Given that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we can find out how many boxes he needs by dividing the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes}
\]

Each box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for Bob to build his project is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which holes are being filled and dug, and then determine how long it will take to fill all the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine the net change in the number of holes each day when Nate is home. Each day, Nate fills 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new holes, so the net change in the number of holes each day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

"In the context of historical laboratory practices, Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing for an experiment. According to historical records and laboratory protocols of the time, Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, due to an error, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 8 test tubes, and two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 16 Petri dishes. 

Igor also brought the correct number of beakers, but some were lost on the way to the lab bench. The total number of items placed on the lab bench was 29. To determine the number of beakers Igor lost, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of test tubes} + \text{Number of beakers} + \text{Number of Petri dishes} = 29 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]

\[ 24 + x = 29 \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the total number of screws James has.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

To solve this system, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]
