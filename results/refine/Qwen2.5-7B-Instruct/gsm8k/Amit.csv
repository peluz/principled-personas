"Amit, with his background in agricultural economics, can provide a detailed analysis of Janet's egg sales.

First, let's break down the daily egg production and usage:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, totaling 7 eggs used per day.

The number of eggs left for sale is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"Amit, with his background in physical training and sports science, can provide a detailed analysis of James's weekly running routine.

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, the distance he covers in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Thus, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total feed given in these two meals is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to account for the pricing pattern where every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern repeats, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:** $64"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**

   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = \(60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = \(30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).
     - Distance covered = \(80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered = \(0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = \(180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"Eliza's regular pay for 40 hours is calculated as:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the 5 hours of overtime, her pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her overtime pay is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Therefore, her total earnings for the week are:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The correct answer is:

"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Amit, with his background in finance and sales, can provide a refined response to the question.

John initially sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, generating a total of:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spends $20 on each of 8 video games, totaling:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After these purchases, he has $5 left. This means the total amount spent on video games and the leftover money is:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining money from the lego sets sales is:
\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."
"Given the relationships between the ages of the iPhones:

2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we start by calculating the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the initial number of pieces minus the remaining pieces:
\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your remaining calorie target, let's break it down:

1. **Calories per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag contains 5 servings, each with 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Remaining calories:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Grams you can eat:**
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is approximately 48 grams. 

**Answer: 48 grams**"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of articles written each day.
2. Sum the total number of articles.
3. Multiply the total number of articles by the time spent per article.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written each day.**

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam at all.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"Given the problem, let's define the variables and relationships:

- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queens).
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

Substitute \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"To determine how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:

  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances they run:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.
- The difference is \(3000 - 2720 = 280\) yards.

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:

"Amit (Financial Advisor) would calculate the total minimum monthly payment first:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Amit then calculates 50% more than the minimum payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Amit recommends is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the annual payment, Amit multiplies the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

"To determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver, we start by finding the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Let \( W \) represent the number of white carnations. Therefore, we have:

\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses. Therefore, we have:

\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):

\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can determine Mark's and Jean's ages using the provided information.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Half of Jan's age two years ago is \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\). Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old. 

Since this was two years ago, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\) years old.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\) years old.

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
\[14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31\]

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."

"To determine the total distance Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- There are 80 candied apples.

First, calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

"Amit, with a background in mathematics, can provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To find the cost of each cup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."

   - Shoes (2 pairs): $20 each, so $20 * 2 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Calculate the money Sara earns from babysitting:**
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so $5 * 4 = $20

3. **Calculate the total money Sara has before mowing the lawn:**
   - She already has $10 saved
   - Total money from babysitting: $20
   - Total money before mowing the lawn: $10 + $20 = $30

4. **Determine how much more money Sara needs:**
   - Total cost of items: $70
   - Money Sara has: $30
   - Additional money needed: $70 - $30 = $40

5. **Calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the additional money:**
   - She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn
   - Number of times she needs to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day:

\[
\text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250
\]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first calculate the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed. The additional amount is:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

\[ \boxed{220} \]"

To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Given the problem, let's determine the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their average age in three years.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years:
- Harriet's age will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

The average age of the three in three years is:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Naomi's Points**: 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Points**: 10 more than half of Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. **Brianna's Points**: 17 points more than Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. **Total Points**: 251 points.

To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

"Amit: To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we first need to determine the number of petunias. Given that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide.
2. Use that information to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

First, we know Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. So, we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

This means Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Stitches for the collar**: The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette**: The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and rosette**:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette**:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]

5. **Total stitches for the sleeves**:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. **Stitches for each sleeve**:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Therefore, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost for both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \boxed{4} hours."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

So, there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars. The total number of stars on the flag is 76, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.

Rice consumed per meal by the household = 5 members * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg per meal.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

Rice consumed per day = 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:

Rice consumed per week = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

Number of weeks = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

"Amit, with his background in payroll and financial management, can provide a clear and concise calculation for Watson's earnings in April.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so we calculate his total earnings for the month:
\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine which job offers higher net pay, let's calculate the net pay for both jobs step by step.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan needs to make, we first calculate the total interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

The total interest on the principal amount of $3,650 is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 she was given.

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal.
   - For 2 pounds, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound.
   - Total cost for taffy: \(3 + 1.50 = 4.50\)

2. **Cost of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets.
   - Total cost for magnets: \(4 \times 0.25 = 1.00\)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the costs of taffy, seashells, and magnets: \(4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00\)

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10 and spent $7.00.
   - Money left: \(10 - 7 = 3\)

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount Tim spent, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies that total is.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles will explode.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total number of candles**: 50,000
2. **Percentage of candles that will explode**: 1%
3. **Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog**: 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode. Assuming the defects are independent, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of one blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\(\boxed{350}\)"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Total number of heads: 180
- Total number of humps: 304
- Camels have 2 humps each
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each

Let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the information provided, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each segment of the trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Total distance: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance: 30% of the first 4 days' distance
   - Calculation: \( 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next day (no travel):**
   - Distance: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Total distance: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years total 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112

"Amit, with his background in ornithology, can provide a detailed analysis of the bird feeder situation in Lillian's garden.

Lillian has built 3 homemade bird feeders and bought 3 store-bought ones. Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than each store-bought feeder. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each homemade feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

To calculate the total number of birds attracted by the feeders:
- Total birds from homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds from store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:
\[90 + 60 = 150\]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{150}\)."

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

2. **Calculate the number of letters in Indras' sister's name:**
   - Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.
   - Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is \( 3 + 4 = 7 \).

3. **Find the total number of letters in both names:**
   - Indras' name has 6 letters.
   - Her sister's name has 7 letters.
   - The total number of letters is \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is \(\boxed{13}\)."

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, so the amount of gasoline she needed in gallons is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount spent on chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.
   - Total cost for chips = \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying chips:**
   - George initially had $5.
   - Money left after buying chips = \(5 - 1.20 = 3.80\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount of money left after all purchases:**
   - George had 1% of his initial money left.
   - 1% of $5 = \(0.05\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars = \(3.80 - 0.05 = 3.75\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - Number of candy bars = \(\frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5\).

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions needed.
2. Calculate the cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the cost of the beef stock.
4. Find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's go through each step:

1. Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
   \]

3. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
   \]

4. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   \[
   \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
   \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
   \[
   \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"Given the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we first convert the length to feet. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, the length in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle, \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \), we can find the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack} + 2 \text{ packs} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs} + 4 \text{ packs} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads:
\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Given the scenario, let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Given the details of the triathlon times for Jon and the adjustments for James, let's calculate the time James took for the run.

1. Jon's total time:
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. James's times:
   - Swim: 10% faster than Jon = 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes
   - Bike ride: 5 minutes longer than Jon = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes
   - Run: Let \( x \) be the time for the run.

3. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:
   - James's total time = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

4. Setting up the equation for James's total time:
   \[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]
   \[ 121 + x = 180 \]
   \[ x = 180 - 121 \]
   \[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

\(\boxed{59}\)"

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume for all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.**

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:
\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume for all 10 raised beds.**

The total volume for 10 raised beds is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.**

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet, and there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"Amit's refined response:

To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to account for the weight he lost over the 3 months he was unwell.

1. Calculate the total weight lost:
   - Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
   - Duration = 3 months
   - Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

2. Calculate the initial weight:
   - Final weight = 70 pounds
   - Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400, the number of toys he currently has is:

\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan currently has is \(\boxed{398}\)."
"To determine how much Daniel has to spend, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the amount Daniel has to spend is \(\boxed{27.00}\)."

"To determine how many cups of coffee Juan must reduce, we start by calculating Octavia's daily coffee intake. The recommended daily amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate Juan's current daily coffee intake. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's current daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"Amit, with a background in mathematics, can provide a concise and accurate solution.

First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the first son needs 12 candles and the second son needs 8 candles. Therefore, the total number of candles needed is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\). This means James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the reading time in the first week:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the durations of both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of the price Herb paid for his house and then subtract that from Herb's price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200. 

\(\boxed{129200}\)"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
   - She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

2. **Determine the number of cups and dishes her friend brought:**
   - Her friend brought 40 cups.
   - Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so she brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

3. **Calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both:**
   - Total cups brought = Judy's cups + Friend's cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\)
   - Total dishes brought = Judy's dishes + Friend's dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\)

4. **Calculate the total number of utensils:**
   - Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = \(52 + 68 = 120\)

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts if Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts.

First, let's calculate the cost of one box after the discount:
- Original price of one box: $100.00
- Discount: 10%
- Discount amount: \( 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \)
- Price after discount: \( 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \)

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
- Cost of 2 boxes: \( 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \)

Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
- Total contacts: \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \)

Now, find the cost per contact:
- Cost per contact: \( \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \)

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Amit, with a background in mathematics and financial analysis, can provide a clear and concise solution to this problem.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns:

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Total calories burned: \(1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, we calculate the amount of water needed based on the calories burned:

- Water needed: \(\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\)

Therefore, the amount of water Hannah needs to drink is \(\boxed{800 \, \text{ml}}\)."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"Amit, with his expertise in basic arithmetic and coin conversions, can provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.

First, let's convert all of Colby's coins into their equivalent value in nickels:

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter = 5 nickels, 8 quarters = \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime = 2 nickels, 6 dimes = \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels = 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel = 5 pennies, 15 pennies = \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Given the constraints and the persona of Amit, let's refine the response:

Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out have a price of $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase.

First, calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost before tax:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will not be able to make the purchase with the given budget.

Thus, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40\) months.
   - However, the problem states that the cost for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding per month.
   - The cost per month for the remaining 5 months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\)
   - Cost for the remaining 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\)
   - Total cost: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\)

The total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. Converting this to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. The height difference is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by setting up the inequality based on the given information.

1. Total cost for the Karate classes: $60
2. Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, we find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

"Given the deal at the ice cream parlor, where you buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free, and each scoop costs $1.50, we can calculate how many scoops Erin can get with $6.00.

First, let's determine the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- Therefore, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"The difference in scores between Ava and Emma can be calculated by considering the additional points Ava earns from jumping on more enemies and collecting more berries, minus the points lost due to finishing the level slower.

Let's denote:
- \( E_e \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) as the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

For Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (8 more enemies than Emma)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (3 more berries than Emma)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (4 seconds slower than Emma)

The points for each player are:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

Emma's score:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

Ava's score:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference in scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the four pizzas, which is $64.
2. Subtract the cost of the two pizzas that are already known, which is $30. So, the cost of the other two pizzas combined is:
   \[
   64 - 30 = 34
   \]
3. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   34 \div 2 = 17
   \]

Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week. 

\(\boxed{27}\)"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\).

From the problem, we know:
1. \(O + W = 17\) (total number of fish bought)
2. \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\) (twice as many orange fish as white fish after buying)

First, simplify the second equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(O + W = 17\)
2. \(O - 2W = 5\)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):
\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this into the second equation:
\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]
\[17 - 3W = 5\]
\[-3W = 5 - 17\]
\[-3W = -12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):
\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, check the condition:
\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]
Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Amit, with his background in sales and inventory management, can provide a refined response to the question.

Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Given the scenario where the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.
   - Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

4. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"To determine the total amount of money used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we start by calculating the total distance \(D\) that the three kangaroos cover in 18 hours.

Given:
- Three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.
- Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\).

The total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. She also has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

3. We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Setting up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we start by calculating the current milk production. With 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, the total production is:

\[ 3 \, \text{cows} \times 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The correct answer is:

   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5600\)."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\(\boxed{11}\)"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"Amit, with a background in mathematics, can provide a concise and accurate solution.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year is:

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
2. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so \( K = 3J \).
3. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so \( A = 5J \).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A = 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). Since \( J \) must be a non-negative integer, let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

"Given the constraints and the persona of Amit, let's refine the response:

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed is:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, the total amount of soup in the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls. After the family eats their bowls, the amount of soup left is:
- 4 adult bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten) = 0 adult bowls

Since there are no adult bowls left, and the pot can only fill 8 child bowls, the leftover soup is:
- 0 adult bowls * 8 child bowls/adult bowl = 0 child bowls

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

"Given the problem, let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   We sum the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by two.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount each received from their mother is \(\boxed{14}\)."

"To determine the profit the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

The profit is:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Amit, with his background in animal care and management, can provide a detailed breakdown of Larry's pet count:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Adding up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"Amit, with his background in mathematics and problem-solving, approaches this question methodically.

First, we determine the number of cups in each row. Given that Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we calculate:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

So, there are 9 cups in each row.

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Since there are 9 cups in each row and they are split equally between chamomile and mint tea, we have:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks per trip. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - The total calories from all pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"Given the problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the New York Times.**

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.**

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.**

The total commission is:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Leo is 42 years old."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Given the constraints and the persona of Amit, let's refine the response:

The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. The book is 1.5 inches thick.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we first calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate:

\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Amit, with his background in time management and productivity, can efficiently calculate the total number of reports Vince stapled.

First, determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Convert this time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, knowing he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Given the hospital's capacity of 1000 beds, initially 1/5 of the beds are occupied. This means:
\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]
Thus, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Over the next 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. Therefore, the total number of new admissions is:
\[ \text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Adding these new admissions to the initially occupied beds, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is:
\[ \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
\[ \text{Total unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be written as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Given the problem, let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

1. **Holes dug each day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 were filled, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

2. **Total holes by the end of the third day:**
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Holes at the end of the first day:**
   \[
   10 \text{ holes}

4. **Holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   According to the problem, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

5. **Holes dug on the fourth day:**
   The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, which means Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
3. To find the total number of corn chips, we sum the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Amit, with a background in mathematics, can provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.

First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the given boxes from the total to find out how many boxes she has left:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the remaining boxes} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:
   - Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

2. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:
   - She uses 4 ounces per day.
   - Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

3. Determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles needed is \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Both cars cost a total of $160.

\(\boxed{160}\)"
"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we sum the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To determine the number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of crawfish caught on each day.
2. Sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days.
3. Divide the total amount by the serving size to find the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish caught each day:
- Thursday: 3 pounds
- Friday: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds
- Saturday: \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{63} \)."
"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed.
2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

Let's break it down:

1. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and there are 5 baskets:
   \[
   3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}
   \]

2. Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines, and there are 5 baskets:
   \[
   2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}
   \]

3. The cost of each petunia is $3.00:
   \[
   15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00
   \]

4. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50:
   \[
   10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00
   \]

5. Adding the costs together:
   \[
   \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[

"Given the constraints and the persona of Amit, let's refine the response:

Artemis and her father are potting flowers. They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds. They plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations. We need to calculate how many roses they can plant.

First, calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the soil used for the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtract the used soil from the total soil to find the remaining soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily sautés 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she sautés 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be done sequentially, the total time is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \boxed{45} minutes."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"Given the problem, we need to find Wilfred's age. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are provided with the following information:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge. Let's denote the initial charge as \( x \).

After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

After the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total hourly earnings from wages and tips.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate her weekly earnings.
4. Determine the number of weeks required to save the down payment.

Step 1: Calculate total hourly earnings.
\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

"Amit, with his background in basic arithmetic, can solve this problem step-by-step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: \(40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
- Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- Average and difficult questions are equally divided: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) for each

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get \(75\%\) of the easy questions correct.
  \[
  0.75 \times 24 = 18
  \]
- Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is given by:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find the number of seats available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - In 4 years, he would have earned = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total money lost from not working while in school:**
   - Total money lost = $100,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off his loans and the money lost from not working:**
   - Total amount to earn = Total amount borrowed + Total money lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His new income is triple his previous income.
   - New annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

6. **Calculate how long it would take to earn the total amount of $300,000:**
   - Time required = Total amount to earn / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

**Final Answer:**
4 years"
"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of each fabric piece. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the dimensions of each piece are:

Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

The area of one fabric piece is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"To determine the average loss per race, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Win: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Loss: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total loss and total win:

- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total win: \(11\).

Net result:
- Net loss: \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\).

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

Thus, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours each painter worked, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Convert the daily work time into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Amit, with a background in finance, can provide a detailed calculation for the annual insurance cost after the increase.

First, we calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The insurance is 60% more than the normal cost of $120.

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.
2. Determine how many loads of laundry are needed based on the machine's capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year.**

- Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
- Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

**Step 2: Determine the number of loads needed.**

- The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
- The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

**Step 3: Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year.**

- Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food for all three cats.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so the daily consumption for one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:

"Amit, with a background in mathematics and problem-solving, can provide a refined and concise solution to the toothpick collection problem.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved, we calculate:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs to save is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to save the remaining toothpicks is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount amount from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

2. Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

3. The discount amount from the original price is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

4. The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"Given the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles, while Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **New Balance:**
   Add the total new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce 400 toys in total and still needs 20 more toys after the first four workers have finished their shift. This means the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

"Amit, with a background in mathematics, can provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.

First, let's determine the number of marbles Bob originally has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To determine the cost per single bagel after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   Each pack of bagels costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   Russell receives a 10% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bagels:**
   Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per single bagel:**

   \[
   \text{Cost per single bagel} = \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This simplifies to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60-day period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). Thus, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, summing up the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Amit, with a background in basic arithmetic, can solve this problem straightforwardly.

First, calculate how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia gave him \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100.

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had.

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( R \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we get:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, this amount is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"To find the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Additional pods = \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Total pods in the special size box = \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - Cost per pod = \( \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \).

3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles for $1 is:
   - Number of cycles = \( \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \).

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the number of days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \(n\) days as \(C_n\). We start with \(C_0 = 2.75\) inches.

- After the first day, \(C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches.
- After the second day, \(C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches.
- After the third day, \(C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
- After the fourth day, \(C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
- After the fifth day, \(C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since \(C_5 = 0.90112\) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since 100 books cost $500, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of slices each friend eats:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Next, calculate the total number of slices for all 6 friends:
- Total cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Total pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, determine how many whole pizza pies are needed for each type of pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]

Finally, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies to find the total number of pizza pies:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the snowballs he builds and the ones that melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac. Since John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, the total cost for the cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

   - Lodgepole Pine trees: \(2 \times 20 = 40\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - White Oak trees: \(20 + 10 = 30\)
   - Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\)

3. **Total Trees:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

4. **Sum of All Trees:**
   \[
   50 + 90 = 140
   \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Then, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, his two-story house is 7 times his height. Therefore, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height, which is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the first floor ceiling height and the second floor height. Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor. Then:

\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for \( h \):

\[ h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles required for all four dogs based on the average:

\[
\text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per day} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we sum the miles needed for the first three dogs:

\[
1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
\]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the overall total:

\[
12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"Amit, with a background in real estate and finance, can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

First, let's calculate the loan amount John receives. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight of the tunas:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72. So, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
Thus, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost Karen would pay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.
3. Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels} \]

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade in total (4 gallons for the party + 1 gallon for Allen).

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, he will need \(5 \times 1 = 5\) cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, to get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need \(5 \times 6 = 30\) lemons.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \).
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \).

4. Subtract the first equation from the simplified second equation to eliminate \( c \):
   - \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \).
   - This simplifies to \( k = 15 \).
