"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"

   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic algebraic reasoning, which aligns with foundational psychological understanding of numerical problem-solving skills.

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"To determine the cost of the boots, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

It is also given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to establish the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, and their total age is 162, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:

\[ 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To determine the average guess, we first need to identify the individual guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the components of her pension plan:

1. **Initial Annual Pension**: Marcy receives $50,000 annually for the first 20 years.
2. **Additional Pension**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive the additional 5% for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30).

3. **Calculate the Additional Pension**:
   - The additional pension is 5% of $50,000, which is \(0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500\).

4. **Total Annual Pension**:
   - Total annual pension = Initial annual pension + Additional annual pension
   - Total annual pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many more hours Harry slept compared to James, we first calculate the amount of sleep James had. Given that James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find the difference in their sleep durations:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to consider the volume transformation and the number of tomatoes per can.

1. **Volume Transformation**: Each can of tomatoes, when turned into sauce, loses half its volume. Therefore, 16 ounces of tomatoes produce 8 ounces of sauce.
2. **Sauce Volume**: Freda's batch produced 32 ounces of sauce.
3. **Number of Cans**: To find the number of cans used, we divide the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]
4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
5. **Total Number of Tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and understand the dynamics of the traffic scenario. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There are 30 cars on the motorway at the start of the traffic jam.
2. **Cars Exiting**: 5 cars take an exit, so they do not participate in the traffic jam.
3. **Cars Passing in the Second 15 Minutes**: 20 more cars pass through the traffic jam in the second 15 minutes.
4. **Cars Passing in the First 15 Minutes**: Let \( x \) be the number of cars that pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that pass through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that pass in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes. This total must equal the initial number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

Thus, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion. This problem involves understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city and applying that rate to the total distance.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We can set up the proportion as follows:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can use the information provided and apply basic arithmetic.

First, let's summarize the total hours of TV watched on the other days:
- Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)
- Friday: \(2 \text{ hours}\)

Adding these together, we get:
\[2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV over the week. Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Henry baked last year, given the conditions of the current baking scenario.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he intended to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different types of bees and use algebra to find the number of worker bees.

Let's define the variables:
- \( Q \) = number of queen bees
- \( B \) = number of baby bees
- \( W \) = number of worker bees

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many tadpoles Finn can see, we start with the initial count of 11 tadpoles. When 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, the number of visible tadpoles increases to \(11 + 6 = 17\). Subsequently, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the number of visible tadpoles decreases to \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Depth on Monday**: The tank has a depth of 17 feet.
2. **Depth on Tuesday**: The tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth is:
   \[
   17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. **Depth on Wednesday**: The depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can break down the problem into simpler steps, leveraging basic arithmetic and the principles of psychology related to numerical processing and problem-solving.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Therefore, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's determine the number of fish caught by Locsin:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]
- Therefore, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Thus, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given a 20% increase every two months, we can use the concept of exponential growth, which is a fundamental principle in psychology and economics.

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Convert the percentage increase to a decimal:**
   \[
   20\% = 0.20
   \]

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

7. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"To determine the total worth of all the toys in the room, we need to consider the individual costs and the relationships between them.

Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To address the decision-making process from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive biases and decision-making heuristics that might influence Jackie's choice.

1. **Loss Aversion**: People tend to feel the pain of losses more intensely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. In this scenario, Jackie might feel more strongly about the $105 loss in income than the $90 cost of hiring an accountant.

2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: From a psychological standpoint, we can frame the decision as a cost-benefit analysis. The cost of hiring an accountant is $90, and the benefit is avoiding the $105 loss in income. The net benefit of hiring the accountant is $15.

Given these considerations, the psychological perspective suggests that Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor provides 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many babysitting sessions are needed, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs received per session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning, which is a fundamental skill in understanding and applying mathematical concepts. Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age, and \( S \) represent Seth's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The equation for their combined ages in 2 years is:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
B + S + 4 = 28
\]
\[
B + S = 24
\]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[
B + 2B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now, using \( S = 2B \):
\[
S = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to break down the costs of the individual items and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To determine Jessica's annual payment, we first calculate her total minimum monthly payment:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find her annual payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{18000}"

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive biases and heuristics that might influence Jerry's decision-making process when rolling a die.

### Event 1: Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (i.e., 4, 5, or 6) is straightforward:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The probability of rolling an even number (i.e., 2, 4, or 6) on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
To determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 2 \times 100\% = 200\% \]

Thus, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic algebraic principles while considering the psychological aspect of problem-solving, which involves understanding the relationships between variables and the rate of change.

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to establish their current ages based on the given information.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average of their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to update the counts of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can apply principles from cognitive psychology, specifically focusing on task efficiency and collaborative problem-solving.

First, let's establish the rates at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces:
- Kalinda's rate: 4 pieces per minute.
- Mom's rate: Half of Kalinda's rate, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Combining their rates gives us the total rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting this time into hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

"To determine the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the remaining percentage of the redwood after the termites have eaten.
3. Calculate the weight of the remaining redwood.

First, we know that each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. The redwood is 200 feet tall, so it consists of:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

The weight of the remaining redwood is:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive processes involved in budgeting and decision-making under constraints. Mrs. Cruz is faced with a decision that involves both financial and psychological factors.

1. **Budget Constraint**: Mrs. Cruz has a strict budget of $400,000. This represents a clear cognitive boundary that influences her decision-making process.

2. **Additional Costs**: The brokerage fee and transfer fee add extra costs to the house price. These additional costs can be seen as cognitive biases or heuristics that influence her perception of the total cost.

3. **Total Price Calculation**: The total price of the house, including additional fees, is $409,500. This exceeds her budget by $9,500.

4. **Psychological Impact**: The $9,500 difference might trigger cognitive dissonance, where Mrs. Cruz may experience discomfort due to the discrepancy between her budget and the total cost. This could influence her decision to either reconsider the purchase or seek alternative options.

Given these considerations, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars. This can be done using basic arithmetic:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

This means there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars. The total number of stars on the flag is 76, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

\(\boxed{8}\)"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are required based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the speed of the car in the slow lane and the distance it needs to travel. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour, we can calculate the time as follows:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps, applying basic arithmetic and understanding of the given conditions.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali's medals: 22
   - Izzy's medals: 17
   - Total medals: \(22 + 17 = 39\)

3. **Understand the relationship between the total medals Ali and Izzy have and the total medals given out:**
   - The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together.

"In the context of the game played by Mike, Jim, and Tony, we can analyze the points distribution and the impact of the extra points in the fourth round from a psychological perspective. This game can be seen as a scenario where players' performance and the distribution of rewards can influence their motivation and behavior.

After the first three rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 42 points.

In the fourth round, players receive an extra point if they have over 20 points. This can be seen as a variable reward system, where the likelihood of receiving a reward (extra point) is contingent on the player's current performance (having over 20 points).

- Mike, with 21 points, receives an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim, with 18 points, does not receive an extra point.
- Tony, with 42 points, receives an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Summing up the points after the fourth round:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
\[ 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
\(\boxed{83}\)"

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members, the total consumption per meal is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day:**
   Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly consumption is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to account for her initial bid and the subsequent increases in her bids after each of the three other bidders. Each bid increases by $50, and she makes a total of 4 bids.

"To determine the total annual cost John incurs for the driving service, we need to consider both the cost per mile and the monthly bonus.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back).

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week (60 miles/day * 5 days/week).

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 15,000 miles per year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - The cost is $2 per mile, so the annual cost for miles driven is \(15,000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}\).

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month, so the annual bonus is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,800 \text{ dollars}\).

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30,000 \text{ dollars} + 1,800 \text{ dollars} = 31,800 \text{ dollars}\).

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can use the information provided and apply basic algebraic principles. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"In the context of understanding the ratio of electric poles to electric wires, we can apply principles from psychology to interpret and solve this problem. The ratio 1:3 indicates that for every electric pole, there are three electric wires. Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required.

Let \( P \) represent the number of electric poles and \( W \) represent the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \). Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Solving for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

\[
\boxed{15}

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive processes involved in the preparation and consumption of iced coffee. The cooling effect of ice cubes and the weakening of the coffee can be seen as two distinct cognitive processes that influence the perceived strength of the coffee.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening Effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B, taking into account the respective tax structures.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the number of students in the smallest group, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm. Given that the farm has 60 animals, all of which are either chickens or cows, and that there are twice as many chickens as cows, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have:
\[ H = 2C \]
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation:

"In the context of this scenario, we can apply principles from decision-making psychology to understand the company's actions and the implications of their purchase. The company initially spent $400,000 on equipment, but 40% of this amount was faulty. This means that the faulty equipment amounted to $160,000 (0.40 * $400,000).

From a psychological perspective, the company's decision to return the faulty equipment can be seen as a rational response to minimize financial loss and ensure the functionality of the remaining equipment. The functioning pieces of equipment, therefore, represent the net value after the return of faulty items.

To calculate the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total purchase:

\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = \$400,000 - \$160,000 = \$240,000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations, which is a fundamental concept in algebra and can be applied to various real-world scenarios, including psychological studies where understanding relationships between variables is crucial.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each segment of the journey.

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Total distance: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Distance: 30% of the first 4 days' total distance
   - Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next Day (No Travel):**
   - Distance: 0 km

4. **Second Week (7 Days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Total distance: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can use the relationships provided:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker size is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker size is:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to understand the underlying cognitive processes involved in decision-making and savings behavior. Cole's decision to buy both types of jeans, despite the sale, suggests a complex interplay of factors such as perceived value, brand preference, and the psychological impact of savings.

First, let's break down the financial aspects:
- Tattered jeans cost $28.
- Jogger jeans cost $6 less than tattered jeans, which is $22.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is $2.
- The rest, $4, was saved from the tattered jeans.

From a psychological standpoint, Cole's savings behavior can be analyzed through the lens of loss aversion and the framing effect. Loss aversion suggests that people feel the pain of losing money more intensely than the pleasure of gaining an equivalent amount. The framing effect indicates that the way information is presented can influence decision-making.

Given that Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans, it implies that the perceived value of the tattered jeans was higher, leading to a greater sense of loss when not purchased at the original price. This aligns with the idea that people often feel a stronger psychological impact when they do not get something they perceive as valuable.

To answer the question directly: How much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 (since he saved $2 from the jogger jeans, which is the difference between the original and sale price). The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.

The difference in original price is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the combined capacity of the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   \[
   4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees/bus} = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   \[
   6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/minibus} = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   \[
   10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

Adding these capacities together gives the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[
240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[

"To determine the number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the specific preferences of the birds for the different types of feeders.

1. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
2. Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We can now calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder.

- Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

\[90 + 60 = 150\]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost**: Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and understand the relationship between the number of cards Kenny sold and the total number of cards he started with.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the situation.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer prepared for 36 guests, expecting half to have two hotdogs and the other half to have one.
   - This preparation aligns with the caterer's initial expectations and cognitive biases towards average consumption.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than expected.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, consuming 36 hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests each wanted 1 hotdog, needing 22 more hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed: 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 22 (for the remaining 22 guests) = 58 hotdogs.
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, falling short by 4 hotdogs.

3. **Behavioral and Cognitive Analysis:**
   - The caterer's initial preparation was based on an expected average consumption, which did not account for the actual number of guests.
   - The cognitive bias of underestimating demand can lead to such discrepancies.
   - The 40 guests' desire for a second hotdog reflects a common psychological tendency to want more than initially planned, especially in social settings.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 4 hotdogs were short, 4 out of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog did not get one.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few simple steps:

1. Determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name.
2. Calculate the number of letters in her sister's name.
3. Sum the number of letters in both names.

Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of 6 is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The items include:

- A set of pot and pans for $120.00
- A set of mixing bowls for $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each, totaling $25.00

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase:

- Skipping rope: $6

2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Sum the total costs of the onions and beef stock.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's go through each step:

1. Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
   \[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

2. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
   \[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

3. He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
   \[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

4. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   \[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Given that 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to consider both the plane tickets and the hotel expenses. 

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - During the busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the increased cost per day is:
     \[
     1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Trip Cost:**
   - Adding the total cost of the plane tickets and the hotel gives:
     \[
     10000 + 5400 = 15400
     \]

Thus, the total cost of the trip is \(\boxed{15400}\)."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can consider the capacity and utilization of memory storage in the context of cognitive load and information processing.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, which means he has 80 units of storage capacity remaining. Luri, having 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, has 60 songs on her player, leaving her with 40 units of storage capacity remaining.

The difference in the number of songs each can add to their players is a reflection of their respective cognitive capacities and the current load on their devices. From a psychological standpoint, this difference can be seen as a measure of available cognitive resources.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step, considering the psychological aspects of pricing and discounts.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we can set up an equation based on the costs provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the relationships between the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi. Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \).

Given:
1. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
3. The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of insects:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Since David found 9 insects, Lily found:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

"To determine the most cost-effective way for Frederick to maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to consider the cost and yield of each type of wood. 

Given:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
- Frederick has $24 to spend.

First, we calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:
- For 2 x 4 wood: \(\frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{200 \text{ sticks}} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}\)
- For 2 x 8 wood: \(\frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{400 \text{ sticks}} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}\)

Since the 2 x 8 wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is the more cost-effective option. 

Next, we determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will provide:
\[ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the relationship between the cost of the house and the lot. Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

Given:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the impact of energy consumption on daily habits and the potential psychological factors influencing Ada's decision to add a new device.

1. **Current Consumption and Psychological Impact:**
   - Ada's current daily consumption of 12 kilowatts per hour suggests a certain level of energy use that may be habitual or necessary for her daily activities.
   - The addition of a new device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour indicates a change in her routine, which could be perceived as a shift in her lifestyle or a new necessity.

2. **Weekly Consumption and Cost:**
   - Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 2016 kilowatt-hours (kWh).
   - After adding the new device, her weekly consumption increases to 2352 kWh.
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so the weekly bill before the addition is $3024, and after the addition, it is $3528.

3. **Psychological Factors:**
   - The increase in consumption and cost might lead to feelings of guilt or concern about environmental impact, especially if Ada is environmentally conscious.
   - However, the new device might also provide benefits that outweigh the additional cost, such as improved comfort or functionality, which could positively influence her decision.

4. **Difference in Weekly Bill:**
   - The difference between the weekly bills before and after adding the new device is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can start by understanding the rate at which one person can paint. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house. This means the rate for one person is:

\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

When 5 people work together, their combined rate is:

\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This indicates that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting this into hours:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"

"To determine how much Daniel has to spend on the items he wants to buy, we first calculate the total cost of the items before any discount is applied. 

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the final amount Daniel has to spend is \(\boxed{27.00}\)."

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information and apply the relevant reading rate.

First, let's calculate the reading time in the first week:
- Judy read 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \(15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- This means her reading rate is \(\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}\).
- Using this rate, the number of pages read in the first week is \(105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}\).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Adding the pages read in both weeks:
- First week: 140 pages.
- Second week: 100 pages.

1. Calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts.
2. Determine the total cost for two boxes.
3. Calculate the total number of contacts in two boxes.
4. Find the cost per contact.

Given:
- One box contains 90 contacts.
- One box costs $100.00, with a 10% discount.
- Pete buys 2 boxes.

First, calculate the discounted price of one box:

"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we can use the given ratio of water consumption to calories burned. According to the information provided, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

First, calculate the total calories burned from both activities:
- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Total calories burned: \(1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, calculate the amount of water needed based on the total calories burned:
\[ \text{Water needed} = \left(\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}}\right) \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the quantities of red, blue, and green jelly beans and then calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( R = 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( G = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To determine how many grams of protein John consumes per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms.
2. Determine the daily protein intake.
3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.

1. The protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \]

2. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so the daily protein intake is:
\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \]

3. To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we can use the following steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss.
2. The number of classes he attends will be \( 10 - x \).
3. The cost per class is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes attended: \(\frac{60}{10 - x}\).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this inequality, we first multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

To solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. First, we simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the original length of the dress, we can use the information provided and apply basic algebraic principles. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's establish the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his mowing rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his mowing rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the ages of the individuals involved. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( T \):
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

1. **Current Status**: The firefighters have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.
2. **Remaining Goal**: The total goal is $6300, so the remaining amount needed is:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Rate of Fundraising**: They raised $2100 in 3 hours, which means their rate of fundraising is:
   \[
   \frac{2100 \text{ dollars}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
4. **Additional Hours Needed**: To find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we use the rate of fundraising:
   \[
   \frac{4200 \text{ dollars}}{700 \text{ dollars per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total city usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To solve this problem, we can apply basic arithmetic and psychological principles related to numerical cognition and problem-solving strategies.

1. **Initial Count of Apples:**
   - Boris has 100 apples.
   - Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, which means Beck has \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples.

2. **Transaction:**
   - Boris gives 10 apples to Beck.
   - After the transaction, Boris has \(100 - 10 = 90\) apples.
   - Beck now has \(77 + 10 = 87\) apples.

3. **Comparison:**
   - To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's number of apples from Boris's number of apples: \(90 - 87 = 3\).

Therefore, after the transaction, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can apply basic arithmetic and psychological principles related to performance metrics and scoring systems.

Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both players:

- \( E_e \): Number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \): Number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \): Seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

For Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \): Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \): Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \): Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To determine the total number of bike rides Chase and Rider take in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the 5 regular days and the rides on the 2 special days.

1. **Regular Days (5 days):**
   - They ride 3 times a day.
   - Total rides on regular days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Special Days (2 days):**
   - They ride twice the amount they do on regular days, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - Total rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\].

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic algebraic principles, which align with foundational psychological research on numerical cognition and problem-solving skills. Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish as \(W\).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\), we get:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = 5 - 17\]

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to ensure that the stuffed goats make up 30% of her total collection of stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

First, we calculate the current total number of stuffed animals:
\[ 3 \text{ (puppies)} + 5 \text{ (koalas)} + 2 \text{ (zebras)} + 4 \text{ (frogs)} = 14 \]

If Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

"To determine the length of the mosaic Milo can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with the total number of glass chips.
3. Determine the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches Milo can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

"In the context of psychological growth and development, the scenario described can be analyzed through the lens of exponential growth, a concept often observed in various psychological and biological processes. If we consider the number of students on campus as a measure of some psychological or social phenomenon, the doubling of students at the end of each month can be seen as a rapid increase in a population, which is a common pattern in certain psychological or social dynamics.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students at the end of each month would be as follows:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To determine the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given relationships between the ingredients. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( z \) = amount of citrus zest in ounces
- \( f \) = amount of fragrance in ounces (same as citrus zest, so \( f = z \))
- \( s \) = amount of salt in ounces
- \( u \) = amount of sugar in ounces (same as salt, so \( u = s \))
- \( o \) = amount of oil in ounces (twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \))

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + f + s + u + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships between the variables, we get:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

From this equation, we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can solve for \( s \). If we choose \( s = 1 \), then:
\[ z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \]

This satisfies the equation. Therefore, the amount of oil \( o \) is:
\[ o = 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we can break down the costs as follows:

3. The total number of cards is 341.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

Now, we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \(3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\) cards.
- Becca has \(3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs is:
\[5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\]

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy had is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the net loss for Milly, we need to consider the psychological aspects of decision-making and the financial implications of her actions. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial Decision and Emotional Impact:**
   - Milly decided the book was boring, which may have been influenced by her initial expectations versus the book's content. This decision can be seen as a form of cognitive dissonance, where she may feel a need to justify her purchase.
   
2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, resulting in a shipping cost of \(4 \times 0.35 = \$1.40\).
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, resulting in a shipping cost of \(20 \times 0.08 = \$1.60\).
   - Total shipping cost: \(1.40 + 1.60 = \$3.00\).

3. **Refund Calculation:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price, resulting in a refund of \(32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00\).

4. **Net Loss Calculation:**
   - Original cost of the book: $32.
   - Refund amount: $24.
   - Shipping cost: $3.
   - Net loss: \(32 - 24 + 3 = \$11\).

Therefore, the net loss for Milly is \(\boxed{11}\)."

   \[
   \text{Total production for the first three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total monthly production:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly production} = 50,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

6. **Fourth week production:**
   \[
   \text{Fourth week production} = \text{Total monthly production} - \text{Total production for the first three weeks}
   \]
   \[
   = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is:
\[
\boxed{14,000}

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time for the first part = 4 hours
- Time for the second part = 6 hours

First, calculate the distance for the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the distance for the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, sum the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we can apply principles from psychology related to speed and time perception.

First, let's establish the total distance \(D\) that the kangaroos cover. Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can express the distance as:
\[ D = 3 \times v \times 18 \]
where \(v\) is the speed of one kangaroo. Simplifying this, we get:
\[ D = 54v \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \( \frac{v}{2} \). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the number of clay dishes each person made.

1. Let \( K \) represent the number of clay dishes Kora made. According to the problem, \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Therefore, the number of clay dishes Rory made, \( R \), can be expressed as:
   \[
   R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, the number of clay dishes Jada made, \( J \), can be expressed as:
   \[
   J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

Now, we sum the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the number of socks and dishes collected by Jack and Peter, and then sum these quantities.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes

"To determine how many students are good at math, we can apply principles from cognitive psychology, specifically focusing on set theory and categorization processes. Given the information:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

We can use set theory to find the number of students good at both subjects. The formula to find the total number of students in two overlapping sets is:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{Set A} + \text{Set B} - \text{Both} \]

Where:
- Set A = Students good at math (both only and both)
- Set B = Students good at English (both only and both)
- Both = Students good at both math and English

Rearranging the formula to solve for ""Both"":

\[ \text{Both} = \text{Set A} + \text{Set B} - \text{Total} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Both} = 5 + 8 - 20 + \text{Both} \]

\[ \text{Both} = 13 - 20 + \text{Both} \]

\[ \text{Both} = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only and those who are good at both:

\[ \text{Total good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total time available and the time required for each group, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

1. **First Year**: The town will build 12 homes.
2. **Second Year**: The town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. **Third Year**: The town will build double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year. By the end of the second year, the total number of homes is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, the town will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Adding up the homes built each year, we get:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships as follows:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the cognitive processes and time management skills involved in earning Girl Scout badges.

1. **Claire's Cognitive Process:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month, indicating a consistent and steady rate of achievement.
   - Over a year, Claire will earn 12 badges, reflecting a linear and predictable cognitive process.

2. **Amber's Cognitive Process:**
   - Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, suggesting a more deliberate or possibly less efficient cognitive process.
   - Over a year, Amber will earn 6 badges, indicating a slower rate of achievement.

3. **Wendy's Cognitive Process:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, suggesting a highly efficient or possibly more motivated cognitive process.
   - Over a year, Wendy will earn 36 badges, indicating a significantly higher rate of achievement.

To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we calculate the difference:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.

**Answer: 30 badges**"
"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the scenario through the lens of cognitive processes and decision-making. Paige's baking and selling activity can be seen as a series of cognitive tasks that involve planning, execution, and evaluation.

1. **Planning and Goal Setting**: Paige decided to bake banana bread loaves for a specific period (1:00 PM to 6:00 PM) and for a specific purpose (fundraising). This demonstrates her ability to set and maintain a goal over a period of time.

2. **Execution and Task Management**: Over the 5-hour period, Paige baked 2 loaves per hour, totaling 10 loaves. This consistent and steady rate of work indicates effective time management and task execution.

3. **Evaluation and Feedback**: After baking, Paige sold all the slices, which suggests she was able to evaluate the outcome of her efforts and ensure that her goal was fully achieved.

Given that each slice is sold for 50 cents, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 80. Therefore, the total amount raised can be calculated as follows:

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount raised is:

"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of red cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Calculate the number of green cars**: The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. **Determine the number of blue cars**: The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( F \) = number of books Fawn has
- \( A \) = number of books Anne has
- \( S \) = number of books Sofie has

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the family's dietary needs and preferences, as well as the distribution of resources.

Given that the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and Calvin and his wife are adults while the two children are younger, we can infer that the family's dietary habits and preferences might influence the distribution of the soup.

1. **Dietary Preferences and Needs**: Adults typically have larger appetites and may require more calories than children. Therefore, the 4 adult bowls represent a larger volume of soup compared to the 8 child bowls.

2. **Resource Allocation**: If the family is to eat one bowl each, the total consumption is 4 bowls. Since the pot has enough for 4 adult bowls, it means the family's immediate needs are met.

3. **Leftover Soup**: After the family has eaten, there is no additional soup left for the children to have for lunch. This is because the pot's capacity is fully utilized by the 4 adult bowls.

Thus, each child will not have any additional bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the scenario through the lens of consumer behavior and economic decision-making. Here’s a refined response:

1. **Understanding Consumer Behavior**: Each student sold lollipops at a price of $0.8, which is higher than the cost price of $0.5. This price difference is a key motivator for the students to sell the lollipops. The higher selling price relative to the cost price can be seen as a form of profit incentive, which can drive increased sales.

2. **Economic Decision-Making**: The students sold an average of 10 lollipops each, indicating a reasonable level of sales. This suggests that the price point is acceptable to the potential buyers, as they are willing to purchase the lollipops at the given price.

3. **Calculating Profit**: To determine the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost. The total revenue is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240
   \]
   The total cost is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150
   \]
   Therefore, the total profit is:
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \$240 - \$150 = \$90

"By applying principles from developmental psychology, we can understand that Martha's shell collection behavior is a form of habit formation and a milestone in her cognitive and motor development. Starting at age 5 and continuing until her 10th birthday, Martha has been collecting one shell per month. This consistent behavior over a period of 5 years (60 months) indicates a stable and predictable pattern of habit formation.

To calculate the total number of shells collected, we use the following formula:
\[ \text{Total Shells} = \text{Number of Years} \times 12 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Total Shells} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"To determine the number of mint tea cups in each row, we start by understanding the distribution of the 27 cups of tea. Lana divides these 27 cups into 3 rows, meaning each row contains:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

cups. According to the problem, in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the 9 cups in that row:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Thus, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to consider the time constraints and the total number of berries required.

1. **Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial conditions and the rate at which the water is being used. Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 5000 gallons. The tank is then emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

To find out how much water remains after 6 days, we calculate the total amount of water used over this period:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to consider his remaining budget and the costs associated with his planned activities. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To determine the total calorie content of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins, and then sum them up.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
   - Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \)

The difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car is:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

\(\boxed{60}\)"

Subtracting this sum from the total number of toys gives us the number of bouncy balls:

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations and solve for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean.

Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports in minutes.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled based on the number of intervals.

First, convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to account for the time she was awake and the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The usual sleep duration is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**

"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to follow a structured approach, leveraging the principles of quantitative analysis and basic arithmetic, which are foundational in psychology for understanding patterns and behaviors.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 were filled, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

   Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29
   \]

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:**
   - At the end of the first day, they had 10 holes.

3. **Calculate the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   - By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40
   \]

4. **Find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( A \) = number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe
- \( S \) = number of Pokemon caught by Stan
- \( X \) = number of Pokemon caught by Alex

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( A + S + X = 339 \)

First, substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \) into the total equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of states in India and then add it to the number of states in the USA.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of states in India is 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

Given that the USA has 50 states, we substitute \( x = 50 \) into the expression:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we start by identifying the size of each pair of boots. Given that Sophie wears size 5 boots and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the average size of the boots by summing the sizes and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]"

2. **Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:**
   - Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

3. **Determine the cost of the petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

4. **Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
   - Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\)."

1. **Identify the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( F \) represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
2. According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).
4. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   F = 2 \times 44 = 88
   \]
5. Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
   \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and statistical principles, which are foundational in understanding age distributions and averages. Let's break down the information given:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\) years.
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years.
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.
5. We need to find Wilfred's age \(W\).

First, we calculate the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ A + B = 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Given the total age of all four children is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[ H + W = 20 - 7 = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \(H = 2 \times \text{Average age}\), we substitute the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know Helene's age \(H = 10\). Using the equation \(H + W = 13\), we can find Wilfred's age:
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"In the context of understanding family dynamics and resource distribution, we can analyze the watermelon division scenario from a psychological perspective. Given that the family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, we can determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

The total number of slices is:
\[2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the situation through the lens of cognitive load and decision-making processes. The task involves understanding the capacity of a tank and the contributions of two individuals over two days. Here’s a refined approach:

1. **Initial Cognitive Load Analysis:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, which is a significant amount of water.
   - Wanda and Ms. B are working together to fill the tank, which involves understanding fractions and proportions.

2. **Day 1 Analysis:**
   - Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumps 3/4 as much as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on Day 1:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Day 2 Analysis:**
   - Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on Day 1.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on Day 1.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on Day 2:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
   - Sum of water pumped on both days:
     \[
     7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Remaining Capacity:**
   - Subtract the total water pumped from the tank's capacity:
     \[
     18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, the remaining capacity of the tank is \(\boxed{6000}\) gallons."
"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to account for the rate at which the power bank lost its charge over time. Given that the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours and then 7% each hour for the next 3 hours, we can use the following steps to find the initial charge:

1. **Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Charge after 5 hours} = x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5
   \]

2. **Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Charge after 8 hours} = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the final charge:**
   \[
   x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

4. **Calculate the values of the exponents:**
   \[
   (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032
   \]
   \[
   (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
   \]

5. **Substitute these values into the equation:**
   \[
   x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.501872 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578
   \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

"To determine the final number of guests in the hotel, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:

"To solve this problem, we can apply principles from cognitive psychology, specifically focusing on numerical reasoning and problem-solving strategies. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal.
   - Let \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

2. **Establish the Relationships:**
   - According to the problem, \( L = 3S \).
   - Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \( S = 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

3. **Formulate the Equation:**
   - The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     120 = 8x + 12x
     \]
     \[
     120 = 20x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
     \]

4. **Determine the Number of Small Stuffed Animals Sold:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which the dwarves can mine ore and then scale it up to the number of dwarves and the number of days.

1. **Dwarf Mining Rate with Steel Pickaxe:**
   - A single dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the rate doubles: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Total Ore Mined by 40 Dwarves in 30 Days:**
   - Each of the 40 dwarves can mine 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, the total ore mined per day by 40 dwarves is \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds.
   - Over 30 days, the total ore mined is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the principle of proportionality, which is a fundamental concept in psychology related to how individuals perceive and process numerical information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Thus, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\(\boxed{89.8\%}\)"

   - Total amount borrowed for college: $50,000 per year for 4 years = $200,000.
   - Money lost from not working during college: $25,000 per year for 4 years = $100,000.
   - Total amount to be earned: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

2. **Psychological Considerations:**
   - Jim's decision to go to college is influenced by the expectation of increased earning potential.
   - The psychological impact of student loans and lost income needs to be considered.
   - Jim's new income after college is triple his previous income, which is a significant increase.

3. **Time to Pay Off Loans and Lost Income:**
   - New annual income after college: $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - Time required to earn $300,000: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

**Final Answer:**
4 years"
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"To determine the average loss per race, we need to follow these steps:

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Calculation: \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Calculation: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. We will use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the shares of the three individuals. Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Convert the daily work time into hours:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the relationships between the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

Given:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved is 19.

We can set up the following equation:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the concept of exponential decay, which is commonly used in psychology to model various phenomena, including the depreciation of assets over time.

Given:
- Initial value of the car in 2007: $20,000
- Annual depreciation rate: 21%

The formula for exponential decay is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, \( n = 3 \) (from 2007 to 2010), the initial value is $20,000, and the depreciation rate is 0.21.

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, we know that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks \(\boxed{15}\) gallons of water in 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the train at each stop, considering the changes in population due to boarding and alighting. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. The number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. The number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. The number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles required.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles required.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"To determine the annual cost of James's insurance after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Next, we add this increase to the original cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Finally, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the annual cost James pays is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to consider the frequency and quantity of sheets used and the capacity of the laundry machine.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption.

1. **Daily Consumption per Cat**: Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so the daily consumption per cat is:
   \[
   60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

2. **Total Daily Consumption for 3 Cats**: Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

3. **Number of Days 720 Grams Will Last**: To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
   \[
   \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the distribution of pizza slices among Becky, Jake, and Silvia. Given that each person's slice count is related to Jake's slice count, we can use this information to determine the total number of slices eaten.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices:
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we can find the number of slices Silvia ate:
\[ 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Next, we sum the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the relationship between the times taken by Betsy and Donovan. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the situation through the lens of decision-making and cognitive processes. Mr. Hezekiah's decision to dispatch 20 trucks and the subsequent news of mechanical failures can be seen as a real-world example of how individuals process information and make adjustments in the face of unexpected events.

Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, totaling 400 tons. Two hours into the delivery, he received news that a quarter of the trucks (5 trucks) had mechanical failures. This information would likely trigger a cognitive process of reassessment and adjustment.

Given that 5 trucks could not deliver, the remaining 15 trucks successfully delivered their loads. Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, resulting in a total of:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem using psychological principles related to cost-benefit analysis and decision-making under promotion conditions.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"To determine the cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to break down the expenses based on the given information. The theater rental fee is a fixed cost of $125 for the first 20 guests, and an additional $6 for each guest beyond that number.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests who will attend the party:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- 4 people said they could not come.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. The base fee covers the first 20 guests, and the additional cost is for the remaining guests:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza originally had and then calculate how much they have left after their expenditures.

First, let's analyze Maggie's situation:
- Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left.
- This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount of money.
- Let \( M \) be Maggie's original amount of money.
- We can set up the equation: \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\).
- Solving for \( M \): \( M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \).
- Therefore, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, let's analyze Riza's situation:
- Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left.
- This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount of money.
- Let \( R \) be Riza's original amount of money.
- We can set up the equation: \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\).
- Solving for \( R \): \( R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \).
- Therefore, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
- Maggie has $60 left.
- Riza has $60 left.
- Total amount of money left: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \).

Thus, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, so in a week, it eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey per day, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas per day, and in a week, it eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\). Therefore, in a week, the third monkey eats \(7x\) bananas.

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey:
\[70 + 98 + 7x = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[168 + 7x = 315\]
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7} = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Teddy completed half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces.
2. He then completed another 500-piece puzzle, placing all 500 pieces.

Adding these together:

\[ 250 \text{ pieces} + 500 \text{ pieces} = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750.

"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 15 roses.
2. Determine the change Jenny receives.
3. Convert the change into quarters.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, the cost of one rose is:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we can use basic arithmetic. Given that Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, we first calculate the total number of toothpicks she has already saved:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."

"To determine the savings, we first calculate the total cost of bananas if purchased individually and then compare it to the cost of purchasing them in bunches.

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas:**
   - Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
   - Jenny buys 10 bunches.
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

2. **Calculate the total cost if purchased individually:**
   - The cost per banana is $0.80.
   - Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost if purchased in bunches:**
   - The cost per bunch is $3.00.
   - Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost for individual bananas - Total cost for bunches
   - Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to determine how much fence Sam gets. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount of meat consumed by the Allosaurus. Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which represents the remaining half after the velociraptors scavenged. Therefore, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.
2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so the 270 kilograms represent the remaining half. Therefore, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \( 270 \times 2 = 540 \) kilograms of meat.
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms represent the remaining half. Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 540 \times 2 = 1080 \) kilograms.

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the remaining inventory of sodas after Ellen and her brother have taken their shares.

Initially:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. The total number of sodas remaining is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

"In the context of psychology, understanding the behavior and movement of objects can be analogized to understanding the dynamics of human behavior and interactions. If we consider the two trains as two individuals moving in opposite directions, the distance between them can be seen as a measure of the separation or interaction space between these individuals.

Given that one train is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at 30 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance between them after 3 hours. This calculation is based on the principle of relative motion, which is analogous to understanding how two individuals might move apart or come closer in a social context.

1. Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
2. Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:

\[180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

**Answer: 270 miles**"
"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the difference in time it takes to ride the two slides, we can apply basic psychological principles related to perception and time estimation.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

**Correct Option: A**"
"As an expert in psychology, I can analyze the situation from a behavioral perspective. Bobby's daily routine of taking a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks can be seen as a pattern of time management and self-care. Over the course of 5 days, this routine adds up to a significant amount of time.

To calculate the total time spent on these activities over 5 days, we first determine the daily total:

- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, totaling 30 minutes

Thus, Bobby spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) each day on these activities. Over 5 days, this amounts to:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

**Final Answer: 5 hours**"
"To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we start by calculating the distance Micah ran. Given that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To determine Sheila's new credit card balance, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Charge:**

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic mathematical reasoning, which aligns with foundational cognitive processes in psychology. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( J \) represent the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).
4. According to the problem, 6 jellyfish changed color. Thus, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{J}{15} = 6
   \]
5. Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate of the fifth worker based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers over 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed to complete the order:**

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the principles of thermal equilibrium and the concept of weighted averages in temperature.

Given:
- Temperature of the first mug: 33 degrees.
- Volume of water from the first mug: 4 ounces.
- Volume of water from the second mug: 1 ounce.
- Minimum drinkable temperature: 40 degrees.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average formula:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

- \( P(P) = \frac{3}{4} \) (probability that a baby is dressed in purple)
- \( P(B|P) = \frac{1}{3} \) (probability that a baby is wearing a bow given that the baby is dressed in purple)
- \( P(B|B^c) = 1 \) (probability that a baby is wearing a bow given that the baby is dressed in blue, where \( B^c \) is the event that a baby is dressed in blue)

First, we calculate the probability that a baby is dressed in blue:
\[ P(B^c) = 1 - P(P) = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Next, we calculate the total probability that a baby is wearing a bow:
\[ P(B) = P(B|P) \cdot P(P) + P(B|B^c) \cdot P(B^c) = \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4}\right) + \left(1 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that a baby is dressed in purple given that the baby is wearing a bow:
\[ P(P|B) = \frac{P(B|P) \cdot P(P)}{P(B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can use the following steps:

1. **Total Reports Received**: 5168
2. **Reports Received on Monday and Tuesday**: 1907
3. **Reports Received on Thursday and Friday**: 2136

First, we calculate the total number of reports received from Monday to Friday:
\[ 5168 \]

Next, we subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Then, we subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]

**Final Answer: 1125**"
"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the decision-making process and the cognitive biases that might influence Abraham's actions.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - This decision might be influenced by the endowment effect, where individuals value something more highly once they own it. Abraham might feel a stronger attachment to the land he owns, leading him to sell a significant portion at a seemingly low price.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has 40 square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - This decision could be influenced by the anchoring bias, where he might base his decision on the initial sale price of $50, leading him to sell the next portion at a similar rate.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has 30 square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - This final sale might be influenced by the sunk cost fallacy, where he continues to sell the land at a lower price because he has already sold a significant portion, and he might feel that he should recover as much as possible.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{170}
\]"
"To determine Geb's age based on the given information, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate half of Haley's age.
2. Subtract 10 from the result obtained in step 1.

Given that Haley is 26 years old, we start by finding half of her age:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from 13:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can apply basic arithmetic and consider the frequency and usage pattern of his face masks.

1. **Frequency of Face Mask Changes per Outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of Outings per Day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Daily Usage Calculation:**
   Since he changes his face mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks used per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outtings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Usage over 2 Days:**
   If he uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days he will use:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Eggs Hid**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
2. **Eggs Found by Each Person**:
   - **Lamar**: Found 5 eggs.
   - **Stacy**: Found twice as many as Lamar, which is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
   - **Charlie**: Found 2 less than Stacy, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
   - **Mei**: Found half as many as Charlie, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.
3. **Total Eggs Found**: Sum of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.
4. **Eggs Still Hidden**: Subtract the total eggs found from the total eggs hid, which is \(36 - 27 = 9\) eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow a series of steps, considering the psychological aspects of data processing and numerical reasoning.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Therefore, the total number of collections per week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week:**
   - He gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree over its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production pattern described:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Given that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{1650}

"To determine how much money Jack has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Sophia gave to Jack.
2. Add this amount to the initial amount Jack had.

Sophia gave Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100. Therefore, the amount Sophia gave is:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 from Sophia, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Thus, Jack now has $120.

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given relationships between the lengths of the ropes and the total length to find the length of the red rope. Let's define the lengths of the ropes as follows:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28, \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations and understand the concept of fractions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

3. **Money Left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his sister, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can apply principles from cognitive psychology, specifically focusing on how we process and allocate resources. Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and half of it is yellow, we can deduce that 6 pints are used for yellow paint. This leaves us with 6 pints to be divided equally among red, white, and purple paints.

From a psychological perspective, the equal distribution of the remaining paint can be seen as a form of cognitive balance or symmetry, which is a common heuristic in decision-making processes. Since the problem states that the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can divide the remaining 6 pints by 3.

\[ \text{Pints of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Bedroom Area Calculation:**
   Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet.
   \[
   \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms:
   \[
   \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Living Room Area Calculation:**
   The living room is 5 times the size of one bedroom.
   \[
   \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Rest of the House Area:**
   The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area Calculation:**
   Summing up all the areas:
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[
\boxed{3160}

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can use the concept of exponential growth, which is a fundamental principle in understanding patterns of increase in various psychological and behavioral contexts.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Additional pods = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods.
   - Total pods in the special size box = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is the same as the number of pods you can buy for $1.
   - Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps, each requiring a different type of reasoning and calculation. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the problem into the first and second halves of the game.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the teacher's chalk usage and the constraints of the situation.

1. **Initial Chalk Usage:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk, leaving 55% of the chalk.
   - Remaining chalk: \(5 \times 0.55 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Subsequent Chalk Usage:**
   - The teacher aims to use 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - We need to determine how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

- **Day 1:**
  - Chalk used: \(2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55\) inches.
  - Remaining chalk: \(2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20\) inches.

- **Day 2:**
  - Chalk used: \(2.20 \times 0.20 = 0.44\) inches.
  - Remaining chalk: \(2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76\) inches.

- **Day 3:**
  - Chalk used: \(1.76 \times 0.20 = 0.352\) inches.
  - Remaining chalk: \(1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408\) inches.

- **Day 4:**
  - Chalk used: \(1.408 \times 0.20 = 0.2816\) inches.
  - Remaining chalk: \(1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264\) inches.

- **Day 5:**
  - Chalk used: \(1.1264 \times 0.20 = 0.22528\) inches.
  - Remaining chalk: \(1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since the remaining chalk after 5 days is 0.90112 inches, which is less than 2 inches, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the situation through the lens of decision-making and consumer behavior. Mr. Marcellus made a decision to purchase 4000 gallons of milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon, totaling $14,000. However, he later discovered that 2/5 of the milk had passed its expiry date and could not be sold.

From a psychological standpoint, this scenario involves several cognitive biases and decision-making processes:

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Mr. Marcellus might have initially trusted the quality of the milk without thoroughly checking its expiration dates, leading to a confirmation bias where he accepted the milk as good without further verification.

2. **Regret Aversion**: Once he realized the milk was sour, he might experience regret for not checking the expiration dates more carefully, which could motivate him to seek a refund.

3. **Loss Aversion**: The psychological impact of losing money on unsellable milk could be significant, leading to a stronger desire to recover the financial loss through a refund.

Given that 2/5 of the milk was sour, we can calculate the refund amount as follows:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost of the sour milk is:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into mathematical equations and then solve for Colin's current age. Let's define the variables and equations step by step.

Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27,000. Since each set of 100 books costs $500, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of apples Newton has at each step and ensure we account for all the apples he picks up and puts in his pocket.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up both apples.
   - Apples in Newton's possession: 2

2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Apples in Newton's possession: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples on the ground: 5 (newly fallen apples)
   - Newton picks up the 5 apples on the ground.
   - Apples in Newton's possession: 1 (pocket) + 5 (picked up) = 6

3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket.
   - Apples in Newton's possession: 6 - 1 = 5 (in pocket)
   - 1 apple remains on the ground.
   - Newton throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining) + 6 (newly fallen) = 7
   - Newton picks up all 7 apples.
   - Apples in Newton's possession: 5 (in pocket) + 7 (picked up) = 12

4. Newton goes home with all 12 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the order:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices each friend consumes:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices for all 6 friends:
- Total cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Total pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizza pies are required for each type of pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together, we get:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Thus, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs, we use the net gain per interval.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals needed is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Conversion to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"

"To solve this problem, we need to track the bandages used and ordered over the three days, starting from an unknown initial number. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \( x \).

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: 28
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \( (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16 \)
   - Since they ordered enough to cover the deficit, they ordered 50 bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \( x - 16 + 50 = x + 34 \)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: 25
   - Bandages ordered: 100
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \( (x + 34) - 25 + 100 = x + 109 \)

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

Since the number of bandages cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the deficit and ordering process. The correct interpretation is that they started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated, meaning they started with:
\[ x = 34 \]

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive processes involved in the distribution of resources and the social dynamics at play. Here, the root beer can be seen as a shared resource that is being managed and distributed over time.

1. **Initial Amount and Consumption Patterns**: Fred initially prepared 24 gallons of root beer. This represents a significant amount of a shared resource. The consumption and spillage patterns (4 gallons by children, 7 gallons by wife, and 5 gallons by friend) can be analyzed through the lens of resource management and social influence.

2. **Remaining Resource**: After accounting for the consumption and spillage, 8 gallons of root beer remain. This amount is then to be shared equally among 3 people (Fred and 2 others).

3. **Equitable Distribution**: From a psychological standpoint, the equitable distribution of resources is a critical aspect of social behavior and can influence group dynamics. Sharing the remaining 8 gallons equally among 3 people means each person would receive \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons.

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, given the constraints and relationships provided.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow a step-by-step approach, considering the psychological aspects of cost and pricing perception.

1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Number of Eggs:**
   One dozen equals 12 eggs, so five dozens equal:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Selling Price:**
   Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets}
   \]
   Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the relationship between the number of strawberry cubes (S) and blueberry cubes (B). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Adding the flashlights for the people and the rooms together, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each. So, the number of rooms with small candles is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, the number of rooms with medium candles is also \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**
   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of the flashlights and the candles, which is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem of determining the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break it down step-by-step:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not explicitly mentioned but is included in the total time, so it also takes 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5 \]

Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is:

"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in that time.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week.

First, we know that Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we know that it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call. So, the number of calls he can handle each day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total number of calls he deals with in a week is:
\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

"To address the question from a psychological perspective, we can consider the cognitive and behavioral aspects of time perception and task management.

1. **Cognitive Processing Time**: The perception of time can vary based on the individual's cognitive processing speed and the complexity of the task. In this scenario, the task of applying varnish and waiting for it to dry is relatively straightforward, but the increase in drying time from 7 minutes to 12 minutes can be perceived as a significant delay.

2. **Behavioral Impact**: The difference in drying time can affect Louise's workflow and overall productivity. A longer drying time can lead to increased frustration and decreased motivation, potentially impacting her overall performance and satisfaction with the task.

3. **Total Time Calculation**: 
   - With the old varnish, the total drying time for 6 paintings is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).
   - With the new varnish, the total drying time for 6 paintings is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Time Difference**: The difference in total drying time between the old and new varnish is:
   \[
   72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it contains \(2 \times 10 = 20\) eggs. Adding the eggs from both baskets together, we get \(10 + 20 = 30\) eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls, we can break down the contributions as follows:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Adding these amounts together:

Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is $2180.

**Answer: $2180**"
"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive processes involved in running a relay race and the impact of individual performance on team dynamics.

1. **Understanding the Cognitive Processes:**
   - **Aaron's Performance:** Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, indicating a higher efficiency or speed in his cognitive processing and physical execution.
   - **Vanessa's Performance:** Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, suggesting she may have better endurance or a different pacing strategy.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is 1 mile per 8 minutes.
   - Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's, so she takes 16 minutes per mile.

3. **Time for Vanessa:**
   - For 4 miles, Vanessa's total time is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."
"To determine the amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can apply basic arithmetic and consider the relationship between the length of the dock and the required line length.

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.
- He already has 6 feet of new line.

First, calculate the total line needed:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, subtract the amount of line he already has:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we need to first calculate the cost price per watermelon and then apply the profit margin.

1. **Calculate the cost price per watermelon:**
   \[
   \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60
   \]

2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit:**
   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00
   \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

\[
\boxed{2.00}

"To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Dora's Current Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's Current Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is now 18, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the Age of the Youngest Son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is now 37, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the Age of the Youngest Son in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To address the problem from a psychological perspective, we can analyze the efficiency and time management skills of Ana and Jane in the context of their task of peeling oranges.

1. **Time Management and Efficiency:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange, which means she can peel 20 oranges in an hour (60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange).
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange, which means she can peel 15 oranges in an hour (60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange).

2. **Difference in Output:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour is 5 oranges (20 - 15).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations, which is a fundamental concept in algebra and can be applied to various real-world scenarios, including this one involving animals on a farm.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method for simplicity.

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we first calculate the total number of slices available. Given that there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to distribute these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which totals 4 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{14}\)"
