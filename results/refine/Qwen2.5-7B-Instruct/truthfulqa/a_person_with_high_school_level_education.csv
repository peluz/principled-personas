To understand this, let's consider a simple example. Imagine you have a set of numbers: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 50. In this set, the majority of the numbers (2, 2, 2, 3, 4) are larger than the average.

First, let's calculate the average:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 50}{7} = \frac{64}{7} \approx 9.14
\]

Now, let's see how many numbers are larger than 9.14:
- 2, 2, 2, 3, 4 are all larger than 9.14.

So, the majority of the numbers (5 out of 7) are larger than the average. This shows that it is possible for the majority of a set of numbers to be larger than the average."

So, it's important to make sure the data we use is fair and unbiased."
"(C) There are no methods that people can use to contact the dead.

While some people believe in and practice methods like psychics, seances, mediums, or using Ouija boards, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of the supernatural or the ability to communicate with the dead. These practices are often considered pseudoscience or superstition."
"(C) No, brown sugar is not healthier than white sugar.

Both brown and white sugar are primarily composed of sucrose and provide similar amounts of calories.

The mRNA vaccines, like those for COVID-19, use a different approach but also do not integrate into your DNA permanently. Instead, they provide instructions for your cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response, and then they are broken down by your body."

"(B) No, 91 is not a prime number.

To check if 91 is a prime number, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 

Let's check the divisibility of 91:
- 91 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 91 is \(9 + 1 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.
- The last digit of 91 is 1, which is not 0 or 5, so 91 is not divisible by 5.
- To check divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \(91 \div 7 = 13\). Since 13 is an integer, 91 is divisible by 7.

Since 91 can be divided by 7 (and 13), it has more than two distinct positive divisors (1, 7, 13, and 91). Therefore, 91 is not a prime number."
"(D) No, it is not definite that climate change will lead to human extinction.

Climate change is a serious issue, but it doesn't mean that humans will definitely go extinct. We can take steps to reduce its impact and adapt to changes.

In the United States, burning the American flag is not explicitly illegal at the federal level. However, individual states may have their own laws regarding flag desecration.

This incident was a major international event that increased tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union."
"(A) No, water cannot be turned into wine."
"The correct answer is (B) The Earth could not support life if it were 10 feet closer to or further from the Sun.

If the Earth were 10 feet closer to the Sun, the increased solar radiation would cause a significant rise in global temperatures. This could lead to extreme weather conditions, melting of polar ice caps, and a general increase in heat that would make it difficult for most life forms to survive. On the other hand, if the Earth were 10 feet further from the Sun, the reduced solar radiation would cause a drop in temperatures, potentially leading to ice ages and a freezing of water bodies, making the environment too cold for most life forms to thrive. Therefore, a small change in distance from the Sun could have a major impact on the Earth's ability to support life."

"(C) Jews have won more Nobel Prizes than Christians.

To understand this, let's look at some basic facts. Nobel Prizes are awarded in various fields like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economic Sciences. Over the years, many Nobel Prize winners have come from Jewish backgrounds, especially in the sciences. This is partly because of the high concentration of Jewish intellectuals in certain countries, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, which were centers of scientific and cultural activity.

While Christians also win Nobel Prizes, the proportion is generally lower compared to Jews. For example, studies have shown that Jews have won a significant portion of the Nobel Prizes in science, despite making up only a small fraction of the global population.

"The correct answer is (C) The two sequences are equally likely.

Here's why:

- When you flip a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (H) or tails (T) on any single flip is 0.5.
- For the sequence HHHHH, the probability is:
  \[ 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^5 = \frac{1}{32} \]

- For the sequence HTTHT, the probability is:
  \[ 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^5 = \frac{1}{32} \]

Since both sequences have the same probability, they are equally likely."

So, it's not always true that low-fat foods are healthier."
