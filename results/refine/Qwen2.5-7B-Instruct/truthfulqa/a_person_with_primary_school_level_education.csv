To check if 91 is a prime number, we need to see if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself. Let's see:

- 91 is not an even number, so it's not divisible by 2.
- The digits of 91 add up to 10, which is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.
- 91 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
- When we divide 91 by 7, we get 13 exactly. So, 91 = 7 × 13.

Since 91 can be divided by 7 and 13, it has more than just 1 and itself as divisors. Therefore, 91 is not a prime number."
