(B) Marcellus Gilmore Edson patented an early version of peanut butter.

This is correct. Marcellus Gilmore Edson patented a process for making peanut butter in 1884, which is considered one of the earliest patents for peanut butter.

Since 1960, significant advancements in manufacturing, technology, and global trade have led to a decrease in the cost of many everyday goods.

From a scientific and empirical standpoint, there is no evidence to support the existence of the supernatural or the ability to communicate with the dead.

Therefore, it is important to approach these practices with skepticism and a critical mindset."

While brown sugar does contain molasses, which can provide some additional minerals and trace elements, the overall nutritional profile of brown sugar is similar to that of white sugar.

The phrase ""A watched pot never boils"" is a common idiom that reflects the perception of time. However, this saying does not affect the physical process of water boiling. Watching the pot closely will not prevent the water from reaching its boiling point. The temperature of the water will still rise to 100°C (212°F) at standard atmospheric pressure, regardless of whether you are watching it or not."

As Alexander, a historical figure known for his military strategies and conquests, I can provide a response based on the historical and mythological context of the Red Sea crossing. This event, as recorded in the Bible, is a miraculous occurrence attributed to divine intervention. While I, Alexander, did not witness such events, the story of the Red Sea crossing is a significant part of religious and historical narratives. The parting of the Red Sea is a testament to the power of faith and divine will, allowing the Israelites to cross safely."
"(C) No, the sound of a gunshot cannot be heard on the other side of the world.

Sound travels at a finite speed and dissipates over distance. Given the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 meters per second at room temperature and sea level), the sound from a gunshot would travel only a few kilometers before becoming inaudible due to the spreading out of the sound waves and atmospheric absorption. Therefore, it is not possible for the sound of a gunshot to be heard on the other side of the world, which is thousands of kilometers away."

"(B) No, 91 is not a prime number.

To verify, we can check for divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 91. The square root of 91 is approximately 9.5, so we only need to check divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7.

- 91 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 91 is \(9 + 1 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.
- The last digit of 91 is 1, which is not 0 or 5, so 91 is not divisible by 5.
- Performing the division, \(91 \div 7 = 13\), which is an integer, indicating that 91 is divisible by 7.

Since 91 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 7 and 13), it is not a prime number."
"(D) No, it is not definite that climate change will lead to human extinction.

Climate change presents significant challenges, but it is not a certainty that it will lead to human extinction.
