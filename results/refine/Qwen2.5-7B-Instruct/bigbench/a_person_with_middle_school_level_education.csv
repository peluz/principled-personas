"Let's solve this step by step, like we're figuring it out together!

1. We know the flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly to the left of the guitarist. So, the vase of tulips must be in the first house.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly to the left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the bouquet of lilies must be in the third house, and the carnations arrangement must be in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between the flutist and the pianist. Since the flutist is in the second house, the pianist must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person with a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives.

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
4. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
5. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is eating grapes.
6. The person who has a television lives to the left of the root beer lover.
7. The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the root beer lover.
8. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

From Clue 6 and Clue 7, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in the third house because the person who has a television and the person who only drinks water must be in the first and second houses.

From Clue 4, the percussionist cannot be in the second house, so:
- House 3: Root Beer, Percussionist

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in the second house:
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

Now, we can summarize the placements:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Root Beer, Percussionist, Cellist

So, the cellist lives in House 3.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{C}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- The tennis player lives in the fifth house (Clue 15).
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house (Clue 5), so the tennis player and the person eating kiwis are the same person.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player (Clue 9), so the tea drinker is in the fourth house.
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker (Clue 11), so the person who only drinks water is in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- The person wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house (Clue 18).
- The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana (Clue 6), so the person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana (Clue 13), so the person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes red lives in the second house (Clue 7).
- The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other (Clue 2), so the cricketer is in the third house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer (Clue 3), so the person who is wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- The root beer lover does not live in the first house (Clue 4) and does not live in the third house (Clue 12), so the root beer lover is in the second or fourth house.
- The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other (Clue 10), so the person who is wearing loafers is in the second house, and the root beer lover is in the first house.
- The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue (Clue 14), so the coffee drinker is in the first house, and the person who likes blue is in the second house.
- The basketball player does not live in the second house (Clue 17), so the basketball player is in the first or third house.
- The person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the clues step by step to figure out where each person lives.

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: High heels

2. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Apples

3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

9. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 4.

10. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

11. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4.

12. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
    - This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Apples
- House 2: Pizza (since it's next to mangos and to the left of the coffee drinker)
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Mangos (since it's next to pizza)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (since it's directly left of the person who drives a convertible).
- The person who drives a convertible must be in house 2.
- The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3 (since it's to the right of the person who ate spaghetti and to the left of the coffee drinker).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 (since it's to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes).
- The coffee drinker must be in house 4 (since it's to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes and to the right of the person who had pizza).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since it's to the left of the coffee drinker).
- The person who is eating grapes must be in house 4 (since it's to the right of the coffee drinker).

So, the tea drinker must be in house 2.

The correct answer is: (B) 2"
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - So, house 5 is the one with grilled cheese.

2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means pizza can be in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house \(x\), the person who had stew is in house \(x+1\).

4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water is the same as the person who ate grilled cheese, so house 5 is also the one with water.

5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the coffee drinker is in house \(x\), the person who ate spaghetti is in house \(x+1\).

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3 is the one with spaghetti.

7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are in consecutive houses.

Given these clues, let's place the remaining items:
- House 1: Root beer (since the root beer lover is directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew is in house 2)
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese and water

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person living there, and each person has a different sport, fruit, and flower. Here are the clues:

1. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

Let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

1. From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are next to each other.
2. From Clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.
3. From Clue 1, the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges. This means the soccer player cannot be in house 3.
4. From Clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos. This means the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's put this all together:

- If the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, then the swimmer must be in house 1 (since they are next to each other).
- The soccer player must be in house 1 (since they are to the left of the person eating oranges).
- The person eating mangos must be in house 2 (since the person with the vase of tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in house 2).
- The person eating oranges must be in house 3 (since the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
- House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person has different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
4. The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
5. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The violinist lives in the first house.
8. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start with what we know:
- The violinist lives in the first house (Clue 7).

Now, let's use the clues to figure out the rest:

- **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house. But since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the second or third house. Given that the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first or second house. But the second house has the bouquet of daffodils, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.
- **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the violinist is in the first house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
- **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a radio and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the second house.
- **Clue 8:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a different person living there, and each person has a different device, flower, musical instrument, pet, and book preference. Here are the clues:

1. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start placing the information we know:

- From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the second house.
- From clue 4, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.
- From clue 5, the percussionist must be in the first house, and the computer must be in the second house.
- From clue 1, the bird keeper cannot be in the first house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house.
- From clue 3, the bird keeper cannot be in the third house, so the bird keeper is already placed in the second house.
- From clue 6, the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.
- From clue 7, the gameboy must be in the first house, and the rose bouquet must be in the second house.
- From clue 8, the cellist cannot be in the third house, so the cellist must be in the first house.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:

- **House 1**: Gameboy, History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Computer, Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- **House 3**: Phone, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start by placing the horse owner in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 5).

- House 3: Horses

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the dog owner and the person with the bouquet of lilies.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the radio and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 3 or 4: Radio and Carnations arrangement (they must be next to each other)

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 10 to place the banana and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 2 or 3: Banana (one house between them)

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the apple and cat lover.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 1: Apple (one house between them)

Since the apple is to the left of the cat lover, the cat lover must be in House 4.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 12 to place the orange and apple.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Finally, we use Clue 13 to place the banana and cat lover.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

The person with the phone must be in House 2.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Phone and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each person in the houses has different characteristics:
   - Shoes: one wears sandals, one wears boots.
   - Books: one reads mystery books, one reads history books.
   - Cars: one drives a convertible, one drives a truck.

3. Clue 1: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person in house 1 drives a convertible, and the person in house 2 reads history books.

4. Clue 2: The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and reads history books, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and reads mystery books.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person who likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport. Here are the clues:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the golfer in the first house:

1. Golfer - House 1

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible). So, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
  - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

- Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 5, which is not possible). So, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
  - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

- Clue 4: The swimmer does not live in the third house. This eliminates the possibility of the swimmer being in House 3, so the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

- Clue 2: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:

1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as given in the clue. So, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can arrange the devices:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green is in House 1.
- The person who has a gameboy is in House 2.

So, the sequence is:
- House 1: Green (gameboy)
- House 2: (Unknown)
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (computer)
- House 3: Blue (phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's place the people in the houses:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person in house 1 likes green.
- The person in house 2 has a radio.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio. Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

So, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

18. The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house and the person who likes blue must live in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. Since the second house is already occupied by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. Since the first and second houses are already occupied, the person who owns horses must live in the first house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff, so the bird keeper must live in the first or second house. Since the first and second houses are already occupied, the bird keeper must live in the first house.
- The fish enthusiast lives one house to the right of the bird keeper, so the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the root beer lover must live in the first or second house. Since the first and second houses are already occupied, the root beer lover must live in the first house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other, so they must live in the third and fourth houses.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives, so the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house and the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.
- The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the coffee drinker must live in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who likes yellow lives two houses to the left of the romance book lover, so the person who likes yellow must live in the first house and the romance book lover must live in the third house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the tea drinker must live in the first house and the person who likes white must live in the second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the third house, so the person who had stew must live in the first, second, or fourth house. Since the first and second houses are already occupied, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fifth house.

From this, we can deduce that the person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

So, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the clues provided.

1. The flutist lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the cellist must be in the third house.
4. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
6. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
8. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

From the above steps, we can conclude that the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the clues step by step:

1. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.

10. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start placing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different pet and a different flower in the foyer. Here are the clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the cat lover in house 1:

- House 1: Cat lover

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- House 1: Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person who plays a different sport and has a different pet. Here are the clues:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the baseball player in the second house:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the basketball player is to the left of the swimmer, the swimmer must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house. This is a contradiction, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.

- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

So, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

6. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in the first house, the pianist must be in the second or third house. If the pianist is in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be in the third house.

Now, the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses. Since the pianist is in the second house, the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in the first and third houses.

Next, the person eating kiwis must be in the first or second house, and the person wearing boots must be in the second or third house. Since the person wearing high heels is in the third house, the person wearing boots must be in the second house. This means the person eating kiwis must be in the first house.

Now, the person eating oranges must be in the second house (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television). This means the person with a television must be in the third house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

3. The person in house 2 drives a truck (clue 1 and clue 3).
4. The person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3 (clue 2).
5. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - So, House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - So, House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
6. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
7. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
9. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3:

- The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{A}\)"
The history book buff lives in the first house (B).
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The soccer player lives in the first house.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
3. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
4. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
5. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
6. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
7. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the violinist lives.
8. The soccer player lives in the first house.
9. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
10. There are two houses between where the saxophonist lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
11. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
12. The person who ate fried rice and the swimmer live directly next to each other.
13. The cellist and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
14. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house.
15. The soccer player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
16. The flutist does not live in the fifth house.
17. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
18. The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.
19. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
20. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
21. There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the person who had stew lives.
22. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player (clue 1)
- House 3: Kiwi eater (clue 14)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (clue 2, 20)
- House 5: Stew eater (clue 5, 21)

Since the soccer player is in House 1 and the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 4, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in House 2 and House 3, respectively, because they live next to each other (clue 5).

- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Stew eater

The person who ate fried rice and the swimmer live next to each other (clue 12), and the swimmer is in House 3, so the fried rice eater must be in House 2.

- House 2: Mystery book reader, fried rice eater

The romance book lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes (clue 6), and the person who is eating grapes lives next to the cellist (clue 13). The only remaining house for the cellist is House 5, and the person who is eating grapes must be in House 4.

- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast, grapes eater
- House 5: Stew eater, cellist

The person who is eating kiwis is in House 3, so the only remaining house for the violinist is House 2.

- House 2: Mystery book reader, fried rice eater, violinist

The person who ate stew is in House 3, so the only remaining house for the pianist is House 1.

- House 1: Soccer player, fried rice eater, violinist

The only remaining house for the flutist is House 4.

- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast, grapes eater, flutist

The only remaining house for the saxophonist is House 5.

- House 5: Stew eater, cellist, flutist

The only remaining house for the person who ate apples is House 2.

- House 2: Mystery book reader, fried rice eater, violinist, apples eater

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on their characteristics.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, must be science fiction book fanatic and green
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in house 3 does not own a sedan.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person in house 4 owns an SUV.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person, and each person has different characteristics:
- Pets: horses, cat lover, bird keeper
- Sports: basketball, cricket, soccer
- Cars: sedan, SUV, truck

Here are the clues:
1. The person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player.
2. The cricketer lives in the first house.
3. The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 2, we know:
- The cricketer lives in House 1.

Using clue 4:
- The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
- Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.

Now, using clue 3:
- The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
- Since the person who owns a sedan is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Sedan and Cat lover

Finally, using clue 1:
- The person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player.
- Since the cat lover is in House 3, the basketball player cannot be in House 3.
- The basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
- If the basketball player were in House 1, the person in House 2 would be the soccer player, and the person in House 3 would be the truck driver.

This arrangement fits all the clues.

So, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person with the radio lives in the fourth house.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.
3. The person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
4. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.
5. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with the gameboy.
6. The person with the television does not live in the second house.
7. The fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.
8. The bird keeper lives to the right of the person with the convertible.
9. The guitarist lives to the left of the person with the horses.
10. The fish enthusiast and the person with the SUV live next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives directly left of the person with the carnations.
12. The person with the rose bouquet does not live in the third house.
13. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist.
14. The person with the radio lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the radio in the fourth house.

Since the person with the vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house, the bouquet of daffodils could be in the first or second house. 

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, the vase of tulips would be in the second, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the second or third house.

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the vase of tulips would be in the third or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the third house.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house.

The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with the gameboy. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies would be in the first house, and the gameboy would be in the third house.

The person with the television does not live in the second house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the television would be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television would be in the first or third house.

If the television is in the first house, the person with the television would be in the first house, the radio in the fourth house, the bouquet of daffodils in the second house, the vase of tulips in the third house, and the rose bouquet in the first house. This leaves the gameboy in the third house, which is consistent with the bouquet of lilies being in the first house.

The fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the fish enthusiast would be in the first house.

The bird keeper lives to the right of the person with the convertible. If the convertible is in the first house, the bird keeper would be in the second house, but the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, so the convertible must be in the third house, and the bird keeper in the fourth house.

The guitarist lives to the left of the person with the horses. If the horses are in the fifth house, the guitarist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the horses must be in the fifth house, and the guitarist in the third house.

The fish enthusiast and the person with the SUV live next to each other. If the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the SUV would be in the second house.

The percussionist lives directly left of the person with the carnations. If the percussionist is in the fourth house, the carnations would be in the fifth house.

The person with the rose bouquet does not live in the third house. If the rose bouquet is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils would be in the second house, and the vase of tulips in the third house.

The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist. If the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist would be in the second house.

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

The answer is \boxed{3}."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each person in these houses has different characteristics:
- Shoes: high heels, boots, loafers, running shoes
- Car: sedan, convertible, truck, SUV
- Lunch: stew, spaghetti, fried rice, grilled cheese
- Drink: coffee, water, milk, root beer

Here are the clues:
1. The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start placing the information we know:
- From clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- From clue 4, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:
- Clue 2: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the first house must be occupied by the person wearing loafers, and the third house must be occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese.
- Clue 3: The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- Clue 1: The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the root beer lover must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.
- Clue 5: The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- Clue 6: There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- Clue 8: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- Clue 9: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the third house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:
1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

1. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Tea drinker

3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. But the tea drinker is in house 4, so the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who had pizza is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

5. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4, this clue is consistent.

7. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the flutist must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (tea drinker).

   - This means the truck driver and the carnations arrangement are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player is in a house to the left of the lilies.

6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tennis player is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
   - This means the swimmer is in houses 2, 3, or 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the minivan is in house 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
    - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

Now, let's place the information:

- From Clue 9, the minivan is in house 4.
- From Clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- From Clue 3, the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step, keeping it simple and easy to understand.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, we can figure out where each person lives and what they like. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The cat lover does not live in the third house.
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.

10. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
11. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

So, the correct answer is:

(A) 3"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the kiwi eater is in house 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This is already covered by Clue 1, so we know the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Television, Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist, Kiwi eater, Banana eater

From the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Radio, Tulips
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist, Kiwi eater, Banana eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 3.

From Clue 1, the history book buff must live in House 2, directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast in House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is eating a banana must live in House 4, as it is to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast in House 3.

From Clue 4, the person who is eating apples cannot live in House 3. Since there is one house between the person eating apples and the person wearing boots, the person eating apples must live in House 1, and the person wearing boots must live in House 4 (but we already know House 4 is the banana eater, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the person eating apples must live in House 2, and the person wearing boots must live in House 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing boots
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

From Clue 5, the person eating mangos lives directly left of the person wearing sandals. Since the person wearing running shoes is in House 1, the person eating mangos must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

From Clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 4.

Finally, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic, eating banana

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

3. **Clue 3:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above clues, we know:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist is wearing loafers.

Now, we need to determine who is wearing sandals. We know:
- The person in the second house is not wearing loafers (since the first house person is wearing loafers).
- The person in the second house is not wearing sandals (since the first house person is wearing loafers, and loafers and sandals are the only two options left for the second house).

Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step, keeping it simple and easy to understand.

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other (Clue 1). So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos (Clue 2). Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (Clue 5). Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist (Clue 6). Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house (Clue 7). So, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples (Clue 8). Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist (Clue 9). So, the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Therefore, the violinist lives in House 3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house. So, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.
2. We also know that the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

So, the person with the computer lives in house number:

(A) 2"
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2, and we need to figure out where the percussionist lives.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

So, the violinist lives in House 1.

"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player must be in the fifth house because the tennis player is in the third house and the soccer player must be to the right of the tennis player.

So, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese is in House 4 (clue 2).

Now, we need to place the other people. From clue 6, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the stew is in House 1 and the spaghetti is in House 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti. Since the spaghetti is in House 3, the fried rice must be in House 2.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. The only houses left are House 1 and House 2. Since House 1 is already taken by stew, the pizza must be in House 2 and the cricketer must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person ate stew and one ate spaghetti.
- One person likes white and one likes red.
- One person drinks water and one drinks milk.
- One person is a baseball player and one is a swimmer.
- One person wears running shoes and one wears loafers.

Here are the clues:
1. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house. So, the person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From clue 2, if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2, and vice versa.

From clue 3 and clue 4, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 (from clue 2), the baseball player must live in house 1.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person who eats a different fruit (grapes, oranges, or mangos) and drinks a different beverage (coffee, root beer, or water).

Here are the clues:
1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We need to find out which house the root beer lover lives in.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. So, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the water drinker must live in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. But the mango eater must be to the right of the coffee drinker, which is not possible since the mango eater would be in the second house. So, the root beer lover cannot live in the first house.

3. **Clue 3 and 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the third house, the water drinker must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is possible. The person eating oranges must live in the first house, which is also possible.

So, the root beer lover lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

9. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
10. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
11. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.
12. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

- The person who has a gameboy lives in house 3.
- The person who is eating oranges lives in house 4.
- The person who owns a sedan lives in house 5.

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step, keeping it simple and easy to understand.

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

Here are the clues:
1. The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
2. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
3. The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. The cellist lives in the first house.
5. The basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red.
6. The flutist lives to the right of the person wearing boots.
7. The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. The basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes.
9. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.
11. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the root beer lover.
12. The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start by placing the cellist in the first house:
- House 1: Cellist

Now, let's use the clues to place the other people:

- Clue 5: The basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red.
- Clue 8: The basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's try House 2 for the basketball player:
- House 2: Basketball player

This means the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1, but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible. Let's try House 3 for the basketball player:
- House 3: Basketball player

This means the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

Now, let's use Clue 7: The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 9: The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's try House 2 for the flutist:
- House 2: Flutist

This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible). Let's try House 4 for the flutist:
- House 4: Flutist

This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

Let's try House 3 for the flutist:
- House 3: Flutist

This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the flutist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try House 2 for the flutist:
- House 2: Flutist

This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the correct placement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 3: Flutist
- House 4: Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12: The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The person who likes red lives in the first house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 1"

   - Not the first house for the radio owner (Clue 2)
   - Not the first house for the bouquet of lilies (Clue 8)
   - Not the first house for the rose bouquet (Clue 16)

From the clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- **House 1:** Wearing running shoes (Clue 13)
- **House 2:** Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, computer owner, fish enthusiast, tennis player, radio owner, bouquet of lilies, or rose bouquet.
- **House 3:** Wearing boots (Clue 17)
- **House 4:** Swimmer (Clue 7)
- **House 5:** Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, computer owner, fish enthusiast, tennis player, radio owner, bouquet of lilies, or rose bouquet.

Using the clues:

- Clue 1: The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Clue 2: The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
- Clue 3: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
- Clue 4: The dog owner does not live in the first house.
- Clue 5: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
- Clue 6: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Clue 7: The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
- Clue 8: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
- Clue 9: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
- Clue 10: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.

- Clue 15: The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
- Clue 16: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
- Clue 17: The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house.
- Clue 18: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the kiwi eater lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner cannot live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the apple eater live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the apple eater must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Pizza

   - House 3: Fish

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not fried rice

4. The swimmer lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Swimmer

   - Since House 5 has pizza, House 4 must have grilled cheese.
   - House 4: Grilled cheese

   - Since the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Cat lover

7. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
   - The cricketer must be in House 1 or 2, and the tennis player must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

    - The bird keeper must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating apples must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

12. There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

13. The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

14. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.

15. There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 5: Pizza, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

The only remaining option for House 1 is:
- House 1: Fried rice

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green

2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means if pizza is in House 2, blue is in House 3.

3. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.
   - This means if mangos are in House 2, red is in House 3.

7. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if truck is in House 2, lilies are in House 3.

8. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
    - This means if blue is in House 2, SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

From the clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

Since pizza is directly left of blue, and blue is next to red, and red is next to mangos, and mangos are next to pizza, we can place these:

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Blue
- House 4: Red

Since the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who likes red is in House 4, we can place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Green
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Blue
- House 4: Red

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (minivan, SUV, lilies, and apples) and fruits (mangos, grapes, apples, and oranges).

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies are in House 3. But blue is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 2, red is in House 3. But blue is in House 3, so mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house. So, the person in the second house must be eating grapes.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house. So, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The cricketer (first house) drives a minivan.
- The baseball player (second house) drives a convertible and eats grapes.

Since the person in the first house is the cricketer and eats mangos (because the second house person eats grapes), the cricketer must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 is the blue house.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

So, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step!

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since House 2 is already occupied by the mystery book reader, the root beer lover must be in House 2, and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- The dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (clue 5).
2. The root beer lover lives in the second house (clue 3).
3. The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk (clue 2). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk drinker must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow (clue 1). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker, so the blue person must be in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (clue 4). Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

6. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
7. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the second house (Clue 6).

- The person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in the first house.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (Clue 1), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the person who is eating grapes is in the first house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.
- The basketball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house.
- The cat lover cannot be in the first house (Clue 2), so they must be in the second or third house. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third house.
- The dog owner cannot be in the third house (Clue 4), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the person who is eating grapes is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house.
- The person who likes green cannot be in the first house (Clue 4), so they must be in the second or third house. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, the person who likes green must be in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 5, and the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.

2. **The person who owns horses lives in the first house.**
   - Horse owner: House 1.

3. **The root beer lover does not live in the first house.**
   - Root beer lover: Houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5, and the flutist cannot be in house 1.

5. **There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the pianist are 2 houses apart.

6. **There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**
    - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 5.

15. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.**
    - This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1.

16. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

Since the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper is in house 5, the tennis player must be in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step and see what we can deduce.

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
4. The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
6. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
7. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
8. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.

12. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the fifth house (Clue 7).

Now, let's use Clue 10: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Next, let's use Clue 12: There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Let's use Clue 13: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a different person with different characteristics:
- One person is a guitarist and one is a cellist.
- One person has a computer and one has a gameboy.
- One person is a dog owner and one is a fish enthusiast.

We have two clues:
1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The cellist lives in house 1.
- The person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The dog owner cannot live in house 1, so the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person with a different car and a different device. Here are the clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

Let's place the information we know:

- House 1: Minivan (from clue 2)
- House 3: Gameboy (from clue 1)

From clue 4, the person with the radio must be in House 4 because the gameboy is in House 3, and the radio must be to the right of the gameboy.

- House 4: Radio

From clue 3, the person with the phone must be in House 2 because the SUV must be in House 4 to be directly right of the phone.

- House 2: Phone

From clue 5, the convertible cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 2 or House 1. But House 2 is already taken by the phone, so the convertible must be in House 1.

- House 1: Minivan and Convertible

From clue 6, the computer cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

- House 3: Gameboy and Computer

Now, we have:

- House 1: Minivan and Convertible
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Gameboy and Computer
- House 4: Radio and SUV

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the information in the houses.

1. **House 3:** Vase of tulips (Clue 3)
2. **House 2:** Computer (Clue 6)

From Clue 2, the person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with the television must be in House 3. But House 3 is already occupied by the vase of tulips, so this is not possible. Therefore, the person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with the television must be in House 3.

- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 2:** Computer
- **House 3:** Television

From Clue 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with the phone. So, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is occupied by the computer, and House 3 is occupied by the television. Therefore, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio. The person with the radio cannot be in House 4 or 5 (because the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), so the person with the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 is occupied by the phone, and House 2 is occupied by the computer, so the person with the radio must be in House 3. This means:

- **House 3:** Radio

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in House 4, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5. This means:

- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

Now, we have:

- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 2:** Computer
- **House 3:** Radio, Television
- **House 4:** Bouquet of lilies
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

From Clue 7, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 1 (phone), House 2 (computer), or House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), the only possible positions are House 3 and House 4. But House 3 is occupied by the radio and television, so the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 4, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 5. This means:

- **House 4:** Rose bouquet
- **House 5:** Carnations arrangement

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

6. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- **House 2:** Cricketer, Fish enthusiast, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 4.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple!

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house. So, the root beer lover must live in the second house (House 2).

2. **Clue 4:** The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with a computer. This means the person eating grapes lives in House 1 and the person with a computer lives in House 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1 (because the person with a radio is to the left of the person with a computer).

4. **Clue 2:** The person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on their lunch, favorite color, and favorite drink.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's place the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

8. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
9. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
10. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.

From clue 7, we know:
- House 3: Pianist, likes red

From clue 9, we know:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the pianist is in House 3, the person who had stew must be in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.

From clue 8, we know:
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
- Since the person who likes yellow is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the houses:
- House 1: Percussionist, likes white
- House 2: Cellist, had stew
- House 3: Pianist, likes red, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti, likes yellow
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each person in these houses has different characteristics:
- Wearing different shoes: running shoes, high heels, boots, sandals
- Ate different lunches: stew, grilled cheese, spaghetti, fried rice
- Have different favorite drinks: tea, milk, water, root beer

Here are the clues:
1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in house 3:
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, it must be in house 2, 3, or 4. But since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 or 4.

Next, let's place the person who ate stew. The person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who had stew can be in house 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti can be in house 2 or 3.

The person who is wearing running shoes must be to the left of the person who had stew. So, the person who is wearing running shoes can be in house 1 or 2.

The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. So, they must be in consecutive houses.

Let's try to place the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2:
- House 2: Grilled cheese

Now, the person who ate stew must be in house 1:
- House 1: Stew

The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3:
- House 3: Spaghetti

The tea drinker is already in house 3, so the person who only drinks water must be in house 4:
- House 4: Water

The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other, so the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 3:
- House 3: Spaghetti, Tea drinker

The person who is wearing running shoes must be to the left of the person who had stew, so the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1:
- House 1: Running shoes, Stew

The person who is wearing boots must be in house 4:
- House 4: Boots, Water

The person who is wearing sandals must be in house 2:
- House 2: Sandals, Grilled cheese

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 6**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Basketball player

3. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Cricketer

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2, because if they were, the root beer lover would have to be in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist is in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must be in house 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Not a root beer lover, not a horse owner, not white color lover

Since the person in house 1 likes white, the person in house 2 cannot like white. Also, the person in house 2 cannot own horses and cannot be a root beer lover.

Given that the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner cannot be in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 1. This means the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives.

1. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
2. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
3. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
4. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
5. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

From clue 4, we know:
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house, so the violinist must be in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. So, the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. So, the percussionist must be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the history book buff must be in house 3 or 4.

From clue 7, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the percussionist must be in house 2 or 3.

Combining all the clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

So, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- Different flowers in the foyer: lilies, tulips, daffodils
- Different favorite colors: green, white, yellow
- Different pets: bird keeper, horse owner, dog owner
- Different shoes: boots, running shoes, sandals

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.
5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.
8. The person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start solving it:

1. From clue 1, the first house (House 1) has the person who likes white.
2. From clue 2, the second house (House 2) does not have boots.
3. From clue 3, the bird keeper does not live in the third house (House 3).
4. From clue 4, the person who likes white (House 1) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) live next to each other.

7. From clue 7, the person who owns horses and the person who has daffodils live next to each other.
8. From clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals (House 1) lives to the left of the person who has tulips (House 2).

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

So, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Apple eater
- House 3: Apple eater (but this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Since the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (since the coffee drinker is not in house 2 and must be left of the milk drinker).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

4. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 1 and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

Since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
2. There is one house between the person who only drinks water and the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house because the person with lilies is in the second house and must be to the right of the person with tulips.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only flower left is a rose bouquet, and the only drink left is water. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

Let's start filling in the information:

- **House 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives here.
- **House 2:** The person who likes green lives here (since the person who likes yellow is in house 3 and the green person must be to the left of the yellow person).
- **House 3:** The tennis player lives here.
- **House 4:** The person who likes yellow lives here (from clue 5).

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- The person who has a phone cannot be in house 2 (clue 6).
- The person who has a phone must be in house 1 or 4.
- The person who has a radio must be in house 2 (clue 10).

So, the phone must be in house 1, and the radio must be in house 2.

- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 4).
- The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who likes yellow (clue 3).

Since the yellow person is in house 4, the gameboy must be in house 3.

- The person who has a phone (house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (house 2).

- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green (clue 11).

Since the green person is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a different person, a different device, a different flower, and plays a different sport. Here are the clues:

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the golfer. According to Clue 2, the golfer cannot be in the second house. So, the golfer must be in either house 1 or house 3.

Now, let's consider Clue 3. The computer and vase of tulips must be next to each other. This means they can only be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

Next, let's look at Clue 5. The radio must be to the right of the television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

Finally, Clue 4 tells us that the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

Combining all these clues, let's test the possible arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).
  - Clue 2: The golfer (house 3) is not in the second house.
  - Clue 3: The computer (house 1) and vase of tulips (house 2) are next to each other.
  - Clue 4: The radio (house 3) is to the right of the rose bouquet (house 1).
  - Clue 5: The radio (house 3) is to the right of the television (house 2).

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 1.

1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
   - Swimmer: House 3

2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

4. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - If the person with running shoes is in House Y, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House Y+1.

5. The violinist lives in the second house.
   - Violinist: House 2

6. The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - If the guitarist is in House Z, then the basketball player is in House Z-1.

7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - If the person with high heels is in House W, then the bouquet of lilies is in a house to the right of W.

8. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - If the percussionist is in House P, then the person with loafers is in House P-1.

9. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
   - Cricketer: House 4

10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
    - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the cellist is in House X+3.

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:

- From Clue 1, the swimmer is in House 3.
- From Clue 5, the violinist is in House 2.
- From Clue 9, the cricketer is in House 4.
- From Clue 11, the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5.

Since the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other, and the basketball player is to the left of the guitarist, and the guitarist is to the right of the violinist (House 2), the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 6, the basketball player (House 3) is directly left of the guitarist (House 4), which is consistent.

From Clue 2, the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist (House 4), so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the guitarist. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 5.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2
- Violinist: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

   - House 4: Bird keeper, Lilies, Blue
   - House 5: Romance book lover

8. The person who has a vase of tulips lives one house to the left of the romance book lover.

   - House 2: Horses
   - House 3: History book buff, Blue
   - House 4: Bird keeper, Lilies, Blue, Tulips
   - House 5: Romance book lover

9. The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other.
   - The romance book lover is in the fifth house, so the red lover must be in the fourth house.
   - House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
   - House 2: Horses
   - House 3: History book buff, Blue
   - House 4: Bird keeper, Lilies, Blue, Red, Tulips
   - House 5: Romance book lover

10. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

    - House 3: History book buff, Blue, Mystery book reader
    - House 4: Bird keeper, Lilies, Blue, Red, Tulips

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
2. The flutist lives in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clues 1, 2, and 3, we know that the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

5. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

6. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house (from clue 15).

7. The romance book lover lives in the first house (from clue 7).

8. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house (from clue 10).

9. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other (from clue 1).

10. The person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots (from clue 5).

11. The saxophonist lives to the left of the person who is wearing boots (from clue 3).

12. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house (from clue 13).

13. The person who has a radio does not live in the second house (from clue 12).

14. The history book buff lives to the left of the person who is eating oranges (from clue 11).

From the above, we can deduce:
- The first house is occupied by the romance book lover.
- The second house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing high heels.
- The third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes.
- The fourth house is occupied by the percussionist and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots and the saxophonist lives to the left of the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater and the yellow lover are in consecutive houses.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses.

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we can deduce that the pizza eater and the yellow lover are in consecutive houses, and the tea drinker is in the next house to the right of the yellow lover. This gives us a sequence: pizza, yellow, tea.

From Clue 7, we know the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses. Since the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater, the sequence must be: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7:
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other (Clue 6), and the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

Using Clue 4:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

Now, using Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
- The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.

Using Clue 2:
- There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
- The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

Finally, using Clue 1:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person with a different device and a different type of shoes. Here are the clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

Let's start assigning the information we know:

- From clue 1, the fourth house has a television.
  - House 4: Television

- From clue 2, the second house has loafers.
  - House 2: Loafers

- From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in the second house.
  - So, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. But since House 4 has a television, the phone must be in either House 1 or 3.

- From clue 4, the person with boots lives to the left of the person with loafers.
  - Since House 2 has loafers, House 1 must have boots.
  - House 1: Boots

- From clue 5, there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person with sandals.
  - The only possible pair is House 1 and House 3 (since House 2 and House 4 are already assigned).

  - House 1: Boots, Radio
  - House 3: Sandals

Now, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Radio
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The only devices left are the gameboy and the phone. Since House 2 has loafers and House 3 has sandals, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves the gameboy for House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's think through this step by step:

1. We know that the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, the person wearing loafers must live in the second house because they can't live in the first house.

From clue 2, since the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and see where they lead us.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

9. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's start by placing the running shoes and the rose bouquet next to each other, as per Clue 1 and Clue 8. Since the person with running shoes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), the only possible positions are:

- House 1: Running shoes, House 2: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, House 3: Rose bouquet

Next, let's consider Clue 4: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means:

- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

Now, let's use Clue 2: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means:

- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with sandals is in House 3.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with sandals is in House 4.

From Clue 5: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means:

- If the person with sandals is in House 3, the person with carnations is in House 1 or House 2.
- If the person with sandals is in House 4, the person with carnations is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

From Clue 6: The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew. This means:

- If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
- If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

From Clue 7: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:

- If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
- If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

From Clue 9: The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. This means:

- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
- If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

From Clue 10: The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:

- If the person with a radio is in House 2, the person with spaghetti is in House 1.
- If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
- If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person is eating mangos and one is eating apples.
- One person has a rose bouquet and one has a bouquet of lilies.
- One person is a pianist and one is a saxophonist.

Here are the clues:
1. The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
3. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.
- The person with the lilies lives in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The saxophonist cannot live in house 1, so the saxophonist must live in house 2.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person eating mangos lives in house 1.

So, we can summarize:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person eating apples lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to place different characteristics into the five houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the second house, and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
6. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
8. The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
9. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
10. The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
12. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.
13. The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different kind of car. Here are the clues:

1. The person with tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives directly left of the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
4. The person with a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2.
- From Clue 3, the rose bouquet must be next to the sedan.

So, the rose bouquet can only be in house 1 or house 3.

**Case 1: Rose bouquet in house 1**
- The sedan must be in house 2 (next to the rose bouquet).
- The SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), but this is a contradiction because the sedan is already in house 2.

So, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 1.

**Case 2: Rose bouquet in house 3**
- The sedan must be in house 2 (next to the rose bouquet).
- The SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), but this is a contradiction because the sedan is already in house 2.

Since both cases lead to contradictions, let's re-evaluate:

- The rose bouquet must be in house 3.
- The sedan must be in house 2 (next to the rose bouquet).
- The SUV must be in house 1 (from Clue 2).

Now, the tulips cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 1), so the tulips must be in house 2.

This leaves the lilies for house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Lilies, SUV
- House 2: Tulips, Sedan
- House 3: Rose bouquet, Truck

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other.
5. The cellist lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The history book buff lives to the left of the percussionist.
7. The percussionist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
8. The violinist lives to the left of the person who only drinks water.
9. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
10. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
11. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
12. The person with a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the pianist.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Now, let's use the clues to place the rest:

- Clue 3: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other. Since the bouquet of lilies is in House 4, the person with a rose bouquet must be in House 3 or House 5. But House 5 is already taken, so the person with a rose bouquet is in House 3, and the person who likes milk is in House 2.
- Clue 4: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other. Since House 2 and House 3 are taken, the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover must be in House 1 and House 2, or House 3 and House 4. But House 2 and House 3 are already taken, so they must be in House 1 and House 2.
- Clue 9: The romance book lover does not live in the third house. So the romance book lover must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 is already taken, so the romance book lover is in House 1.
- Clue 10: The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house. So the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1, House 3, or House 5. But House 1 is taken by the romance book lover, and House 5 is taken by the vase of tulips, so the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3.
- Clue 11: The violinist does not live in the fourth house. So the violinist must be in House 1, House 2, House 3, or House 5. But House 1, House 2, and House 3 are taken, so the violinist is in House 5.
- Clue 8: The violinist lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. So the person who only drinks water must be in House 6, but there is no House 6, so the person who only drinks water is in House 6 (which is not possible in this context, but we can infer it's in the next available house, which is House 6 if we extend the sequence).

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Milk drinker
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Tea drinker
- House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

From the above arrangement, we can see that the person who likes milk lives in House 3.

1. **House 1**: The person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis lives here.
2. **House 4**: The person who drives a convertible lives here.
3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the cricketer can live in House 1, 2, or 3.
4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. So, the swimmer can live in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who likes white can live in House 2, 3, or 4.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. So, if the person who likes white is in House 3, the person who is eating a banana must be in House 2.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. So, if the person who is eating oranges is in House 3, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2.
7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in House 1 or 4. Since the convertible is in House 4, the SUV must be in House 1.
8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. So, the person who owns an SUV (House 1) and the person who is eating a banana (House 2) must be next to each other.
9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. So, if the person who likes white is in House 3, the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2.
10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. So, the person who owns an SUV (House 1) and the person who likes blue (House 2) must be next to each other.
11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. So, the soccer player can live in House 1, 2, or 3. Given the constraints, the soccer player must be in House 1.
12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. So, if the cricketer is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 1.

Now, we can fill in the details:
- **House 1**: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- **House 2**: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- **House 3**: White, Cricketer
- **House 4**: Convertible

The basketball player must live in House 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - So, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first or third house. But since the first house has stew, the grilled cheese must be in the third house.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew is in the first house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

So, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. So, House 1 has carnations.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, House 3 has yellow.
3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. Since House 1 has carnations, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.
5. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since House 3 has yellow, the horses and blue must be in House 2 or House 1.
6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means the percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.
7. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

From the clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Tulips (since it's next to the bird keeper and not yellow or rose)
- House 3: Yellow

So, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that the person in the first house (house 1) is a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist. This means the person in house 1 likes fantasy books and plays the cello.
2. The person in the second house (house 2) must be a mystery book reader because the only other book type left is mystery.
3. We also know that the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person in house 1 likes green, and the person in house 2 likes red.

So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book reader and likes green. The person in house 2 is a mystery book reader and likes red.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
2. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
3. **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
4. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
5. **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

6. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
7. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
8. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
9. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
10. **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
11. **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.

14. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
   - So, the golfer is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - So, the history book buff is in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means if the swimmer is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3, and vice versa. If the swimmer is in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1 (since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic).

So, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

The baseball player must be in House 4 (Clue 11):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater

- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer

- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple and easy to understand.

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti.
- One person is a cat lover and one owns horses.
- One person likes history books and one likes romance books.
- One person is wearing sandals and one is wearing running shoes.

We have two clues:
1. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book lover lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's think about the clues:
- From Clue 1, if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- If the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 owns horses.

From Clue 2, the history book lover must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book lover. This means the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals.
2. If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book lover. This means the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals.

Since the history book lover must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, the first scenario fits better:
- The person in house 1 ate spaghetti.
- The person in house 2 ate fried rice.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different musical instrument.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.
4. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1:
- The person with the sedan must live in house 1.
- The person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

From Clue 2:
- Since the person in house 1 does not play the flute, the person in house 2 must be the flutist.

So, we can conclude:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies (and the flutist)

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the people in the houses.

1. The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.
2. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
3. There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.

6. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
7. There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
8. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
9. There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

Let's start placing the known elements:

- The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Since there is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house.

So, we have:
1. Bouquet of daffodils
2. ?
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Next, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house and the swimmer in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Bouquet of daffodils
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader and does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person with carnations, the tennis player must live in the third house. But the third house is already occupied by the person with a rose bouquet. Therefore, the tennis player must live in the second house, and the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the golfer must live in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Finally, there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Romance book lover
4. Golfer

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

- **House 4:** Television

Now, let's place the gameboy and computer:

- **Clue 5:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
- **Clue 12:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.

- **House 2:** Carnations arrangement
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Television
- **House 5:** Milk drinker

Now, let's place the root beer lover:

- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a rose bouquet lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the root beer lover cannot be in House 3. The only possible positions for the root beer lover are House 1, 2, 4, or 5. Given the two flowers are one house apart, and considering the other placements, the root beer lover must be in House 1.

- **House 1:** Root beer lover

Now, let's place the remaining flowers and drinks:

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 10:** The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.

- **House 2:** Water drinker
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

Finally, the remaining flowers and drinks:

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Water drinker
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

**(E) 5**"
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's place the characteristics:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red
- The person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who likes yellow lives in House 3, 4, or 5.

Given the clues, the only consistent placement for the person who likes white is House 2. This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The percussionist lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

From clue 2, we know the percussionist is in the second house. So, the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 3, the violinist must be in the first house because the basketball player is in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow cannot be in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

From clue 5, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the tennis player must be in the first house.

So, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the houses.

1. The person who has a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover.
2. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
9. The cellist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
11. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
13. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
14. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
15. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

From Clue 1, the computer must be in house 1 and the root beer lover in house 2.

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 3 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and they are next to each other).

From Clue 7, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3, so it must be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5.

From Clue 13, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 or 5 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3).

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4 or 2. Since house 2 is occupied by the root beer lover, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the percussionist must be to the right of the gameboy. Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 4, there is one house between the phone and the television. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5 (since the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 8, there is one house between the cellist and the guitarist. Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 12, the root beer lover (house 2) lives to the left of the percussionist (house 5).

From Clue 10, the coffee drinker (house 3) lives to the right of the milk drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).

From Clue 11, the guitarist (house 3) lives to the right of the phone (house 1).

From Clue 16, the tea drinker lives to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), the tea drinker is in house 1 and the pianist is in house 5.

From Clue 9, the cellist does not live in house 4, so the cellist is in house 5.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 5, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1, 2, or 4. Since house 1 is the phone and house 2 is the root beer lover, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 11:** The person with daffodils (D) lives directly left of the cat lover (C). This means D and C are in adjacent houses, with D in the left house.
2. **Clue 13:** The person with a rose bouquet (R) lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF).
3. **Clue 12:** The person with a convertible (CV) lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff (HB).
4. **Clue 16:** The person with a convertible (CV) lives directly left of the fish enthusiast (FE).
5. **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast (FE) lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover (RB).

From Clue 16, we know:
- CV is directly left of FE.

From Clue 15, we know:
- FE is to the right of RB.

From Clue 12, we know:
- CV is to the left of HB.

From Clue 13, we know:
- R is to the left of SF.

From Clue 11, we know:
- D is to the left of C.

Now, let's place these clues in the houses:

- Since CV is directly left of FE, and FE is to the right of RB, we can place RB, CV, and FE in three consecutive houses.
- Since CV is to the left of HB, HB must be to the right of FE.
- Since R is to the left of SF, R and SF must be in two consecutive houses, with R to the left of SF.
- Since D is to the left of C, D and C must be in two consecutive houses, with D to the left of C.

Let's try to fit these clues into the houses:

1. **House 1:** D (daffodils)
2. **House 2:** C (cat lover)
3. **House 3:** CV (convertible)
4. **House 4:** FE (fish enthusiast)
5. **House 5:** HB (history book buff)

Now, we need to place R and SF, and R must be to the left of SF. We also need to place SF somewhere to the right of D and C, and R somewhere to the left of SF.

- R and SF can be in House 1 and House 2, but D and C are already in House 1 and House 2.
- R and SF can be in House 2 and House 3, but CV is in House 3.
- R and SF can be in House 3 and House 4, but FE is in House 4.
- R and SF can be in House 4 and House 5, but HB is in House 5.

So, R and SF must be in House 1 and House 2, but D and C are already there. Therefore, R and SF must be in House 2 and House 3.

- R is in House 2.
- SF is in House 3.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- Pianist (P) is to the right of Bird (B).
- Fantasy (FB) and History (HB) are adjacent.
- HB is not in the fifth house.
- Sx and SF are adjacent.
- SU is directly left of R.

So, we can place:

1. **House 1:** SU (SUV)
2. **House 2:** R (rose bouquet)
3. **House 3:** SF (science fiction book fanatic)
4. **House 4:** P (pianist)
5. **House 5:** HB (history book buff)

Finally, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- Daffodils (D) and Cat (C) are adjacent, with D to the left of C.
- Carnations (CA) and Cellist (C) are two houses apart.
- Sx and SF are adjacent.

So, we can place:

1. **House 1:** SU (SUV)
2. **House 2:** D (daffodils)
3. **House 3:** C (cat lover)
4. **House 4:** CA (carnations)
5. **House 5:** Sx (saxophonist)

The person who drives a minivan (MV) lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. **Clue 3:** The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 13:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house. So, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.
5. **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses.
6. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses.
7. **Clue 11:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 15:** The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 10:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
10. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 9:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
12. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
13. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
14. **Clue 14:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 17:** There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the minivan cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, the truck and the convertible must be two houses apart. Let's consider the possible positions:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the truck and the computer must be two houses apart. Let's consider the possible positions:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be next to each other. From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the carnations arrangement must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be to the right of the bird keeper. From Clue 7, the gameboy cannot be in House 2.

By analyzing the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Minivan
- House 5: Convertible

From Clue 8, the truck must be in House 3, and the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be next to each other. Since the convertible is in House 5, the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be next to each other. Since the vase of tulips is in House 4, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

From clues 5 and 6, we see that the saxophonist and the basketball player both live in house 1. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Given that the saxophonist and the basketball player both live in house 1, let's restate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple!

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 likes history books.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. So, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- House 2: Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The person in the second house, who is wearing high heels, must be a fish enthusiast.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the information in the houses.

1. **House 1: Carnations**
2. **House 3: Apples**
3. **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
4. **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 2, which is already occupied by pizza. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 4.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the information in the houses.

1. **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
2. **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

Finally, the cellist must live in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person who plays a different musical instrument and eats a different kind of fruit. Here are the clues:

1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

Let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

1. From Clue 1, the pianist and the kiwi-eater are next to each other.
2. From Clue 2, the flutist is to the right of the violinist.
3. From Clue 3, the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.
4. From Clue 4, the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the kiwi-eater next to each other. The only way to satisfy Clue 4 (one house between the violinist and the kiwi-eater) is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Now, we need to place the grapes-eater. From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1 because there is one house between the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
8. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
9. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
10. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the dog owner must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house. But the third house is already occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person who plays a different musical instrument and has a favorite drink. Here are the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From Clue 1, we know the root beer lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the pianist lives directly left of the cellist. Since the first house is on the left and the second house is on the right, the pianist must live in the first house and the cellist must live in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in House 4:
- House 4: Boots
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already occupied by boots, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 5:
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 3, the person wearing sandals cannot be in House 5, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 4 and 5 are already occupied, the person wearing sandals must be in House 1:
- House 1: Sandals

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since House 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied, the only possible positions are:
- House 2: Running Shoes
- House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

From Clue 5, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. Since House 4 is already occupied by the vase of tulips, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2:
- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 8, the person with the bouquet of daffodils (House 2) and the person wearing running shoes (House 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent with our arrangement.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and see where each person lives.

1. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses.
2. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes white.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the house immediately to the left of the person who likes white.

From Clues 10, 9, 3, and 4, we can deduce:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Person who likes white
- House 3: Person who only drinks water
- House 4: Tea drinker

5. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. So, the baseball player can live in House 1, 3, or 4.

6. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

9. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

10. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
- House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on the given information.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots, Red
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different type of book that the person living there likes. Here are the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 4, since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house. But Clue 1 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the romance book lover must be to the right of the carnations arrangement (Clue 2), and the carnations arrangement cannot be in the first house (fantasy book enthusiast), it must be in the second house. This means the romance book lover is in the third house, and the vase of tulips is in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1.
3. This means the person in House 2 is wearing sandals and is the romance book lover.

So, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we know:
- The percussionist must live in house 1 because it's to the left of house 2.
- Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

From clue 3, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Person who owns a sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: Person who likes white

Now, let's assign the colors and cars:
- The person in house 2 (sedan and convertible) is not the one who likes white or yellow.
- The person in house 1 (yellow) is not the one who owns a sedan.
- The person in house 3 (white) is not the one who owns a sedan.

Since the person in house 2 owns a sedan and has a convertible, the person in house 1 must like yellow, and the person in house 3 must like white. The only car left for the person in house 1 is the minivan, and the only car left for the person in house 3 is the sedan.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow, Minivan
- House 2: White, Sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: Blue, Sedan

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

- House 4: Bird keeper, not high heels (must be dog owner, cat lover, or fish enthusiast)
- House 5: Fish enthusiast, not loafers, not minivan (must be dog owner, cat lover, or SUV)

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
2. The person who ate fried rice is also the fantasy book enthusiast.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.
5. The person who ate spaghetti is the science fiction book fanatic.
6. The only person left is the one who ate grilled cheese and reads mystery books, and they must live in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Sure! Let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. Each house has a different flower arrangement and a different pet.
3. The clue tells us that the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner.

Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

So, the person with the carnations lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person in house 2 is eating kiwis.
2. The person in house 1 must be drinking water because the person in house 2 is eating kiwis and the person in house 1 is directly left of the person drinking water (clue 1).
3. The person in house 1 is also wearing sandals because the person in house 2 is wearing high heels (clue 1).
4. The person in house 2 is drinking milk because they are not drinking water and the only other drink is milk.
5. The person in house 1 is wearing high heels because they are not wearing sandals and the only other shoe type is high heels.

"Let's solve this step by step, like we're figuring it out together!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person has a television and one has a phone.
- One person is wearing sandals and one is wearing high heels.
- One person drinks tea and one drinks water.
- One person is eating kiwis and one is eating grapes.

Here are the clues:
1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person wearing high heels is in the left house (House 1) and the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From clue 3, we know:
- The tea drinker is in the left house (House 1) and the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

So, we can put this together:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Now, we need to figure out who is eating kiwis. We know:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (as per clue 2).

Therefore, the person in House 1 must be eating kiwis.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only live in house 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Now, let's place the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 3)
- The violinist cannot be in house 3, so the violinist must be in house 1 or 2.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

So, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives and what they ate for lunch.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

   - House 2: Radio (since it can't be House 4)

3. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 1: Gameboy (since it can't be House 4)

4. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - House 3: Grilled cheese
   - House 4: Pizza

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - House 1: Television (since it must be to the left of the phone)

7. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - House 5: Fried rice

8. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - House 2: Radio

Now, we have:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

The only devices left are the phone and the computer, and the only lunches left are stew and spaghetti. Since the person who has a television lives in House 1, the person who has a phone must be in House 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."

1. The tennis player lives in the first house.
2. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
3. The bird keeper lives in the second house.
4. The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover, so the basketball player is in the second house and the cat lover is in the third house.

Now, the houses look like this:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: (Unknown)

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the houses.

5. The baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 and the fried rice eater in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the baseball player must be in house 5 and the fried rice eater in house 4.

Now, the houses look like this:
- House 1: Baseball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the houses.

6. The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. The saxophonist must be in house 3 and the grilled cheese eater in house 4.

Now, the houses look like this:
- House 1: Baseball player

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the houses.

7. The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. The fried rice eater must be in house 3 and the orange eater in house 4. But house 4 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, so the fried rice eater must be in house 2 and the orange eater in house 3.

Now, the houses look like this:
- House 1: Baseball player
- House 2: Fried rice eater
- House 3: Orange eater
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the houses.

8. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. The kiwi eater must be in house 2 and the apple eater in house 3.

Now, the houses look like this:
- House 1: Baseball player
- House 2: Kiwi eater
- House 3: Apple eater
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 5: Percussionist

Finally, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the houses.

9. The person who is eating bananas lives in house 4.

Now, the houses look like this:
- House 1: Baseball player
- House 2: Kiwi eater
- House 3: Apple eater
- House 4: Banana eater
- House 5: Percussionist

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, because if they did, the grilled cheese eater would have to be in house 1, which would not satisfy the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must live in house 1.

Given these clues, we can figure out the following:

- Since the percussionist lives in house 1, the bird keeper cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

- Since the bird keeper lives in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (because the grilled cheese eater lives to the right of the bird keeper, and house 1 is to the left of house 2).

- Therefore, the pizza eater must live in house 2 (since the grilled cheese eater is in house 1 and the bird keeper is in house 2).

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).

Here's how we figured it out:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house (Clue 2).
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house (Clue 4).
5. The baseball player does not live in the third house (Clue 5).
6. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house (Clue 6).
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player (Clue 7).
8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper (Clue 8).
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9).

From Clue 8, the soccer player must live in the first or second house since the bird keeper is in the third house. From Clue 9, the fish enthusiast must live in the first or second house as well, and they must be to the left of the soccer player.

Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the soccer player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5 and Clue 8), so the soccer player must be in the first or second house. The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house as well.

From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the convertible cannot be there (Clue 6).

From Clue 7, the person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so the baseball player must be in the first or second house. The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan must be in the third or fourth house.

The only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house. The correct answer is (A)."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step using the clues provided.

1. **House 1: Cat lover**
   - The cat lover lives in the first house.

2. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
   - This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.

3. **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.

4. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the flutist cannot be in House 1.

5. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
   - This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1.

6. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.

7. **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house.
   - This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.

8. **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

9. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

"To solve this problem, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives and what they like.

1. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

- House 2: Grapes

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 5:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. But since house 2 is already occupied by grapes, they must be in houses 1 and 3.

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

This means the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1. This leaves house 4 for the person who is eating a banana.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

Using Clue 3, the person who likes white must be in house 2 (since there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: White
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple and easy to understand.

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, because if they were in house 2, the person wearing running shoes would not be to the right of them.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader on the left.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the cat lover is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 1, and the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

1. **Clue 1**: The person with daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone.
   - This means the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 2**: The water drinker lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has the root beer drinker.

4. **Clue 4**: The person with a television does not live in the second house.
   - So, the television is in either the first or third house.

5. **Clue 5**: The person with a television lives to the right of the person with tulips.
   - This means the tulips cannot be in the third house, and the television must be in the third house.

From clues 4 and 5:
- The television is in the third house.
- The tulips must be in the first or second house.

Since the root beer drinker is in the first house (clue 3), the tulips cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the tulips must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses. Given that the first house has the tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

6. Kiwis and milk must be adjacent, with kiwis in the left house (from clue 5).
7. Boots cannot be in House 3 (from clue 4), and boots must be to the right of the gameboy (from clue 6).

Given the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers

6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. The cricketer does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the sports:

- From Clue 1, the golfer cannot be in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the cricketer cannot be in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the golfer and the baseball player must be next to each other.
- From Clue 4, the person with carnations and the person with horses must be next to each other.
- From Clue 5, the person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player.
- From Clue 6, the person with a rose bouquet must be to the left of the person with daffodils.

Let's place the sports:

- The baseball player must be in house 3 (since the golfer cannot be in house 3 and the cricketer cannot be in house 3).
- The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other, so the golfer must be in house 2.

Now we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Baseball player

Next, let's place the flowers:

- The person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player (Clue 5), so the person with carnations must be in house 1.
- The person with carnations and the person with horses are next to each other (Clue 4), so the person with horses must be in house 2.

Now we know:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Baseball player

Finally, let's place the pets:

- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the person with horses (Clue 2), so the fish enthusiast must be in house 1.
- The person with horses and the baseball player are next to each other, and the person with a rose bouquet must be to the left of the person with daffodils (Clue 6).

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person with horses is in house 2, the person with a rose bouquet must be in house 1, and the person with daffodils must be in house 3.

Now we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast, Carnations
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Baseball player, Daffodils

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person, and each person has different characteristics:
- Each person has a different pet: one has a bird, one has a dog, and one has horses.
- Each person has a different car: one has a convertible, one has a truck, and one has a sedan.
- Each person is eating a different fruit: one is eating a banana, one is eating mangos, and one is eating oranges.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
3. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
6. The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

Let's start placing the information we know:
- House 1: Oranges (from Clue 1)
- House 3: Horses (from Clue 5)

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The person who is eating mangos cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

- House 2: Mangos

Next, let's use Clue 6:
- The person who is eating mangos (House 2) and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. Since the person eating mangos is in House 2, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.

- House 3: Convertible, Horses

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person driving a convertible is in House 3, the person driving a truck must be in House 2.

- House 2: Mangos, Convertible

Finally, let's use Clue 3:
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in House 3 and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 1 and the bird keeper must be in House 2.

- House 1: Oranges, Bird Keeper
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible, Dog Owner
- House 3: Horses, Truck

So, the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

- From Clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- From Clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff.
- This means the mystery book reader must be in house 1, the romance book lover in house 3, and the history book buff in house 4.

Now, let's place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- From Clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
- From Clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- From Clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
- This means the percussionist must be in house 3, the guitarist in house 2, and the person who had stew in house 4.

Next, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- From Clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
- This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- From Clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
- The only remaining houses are 2 and 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2 and the percussionist is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the flutist in house 3.

Finally, let's place the saxophonist and the person who had pizza:
- From Clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
- The only remaining houses are 4 and 5. Since the person who had stew is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 5, and the saxophonist in house 6.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Science fiction book fanatic
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Flutist
4. Stew
5. Pizza
6. Saxophonist

The percussionist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

From these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Sedan, not red, not fried rice.
- House 3: Romance book lover.
- House 5: Not history book buff.

Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

From Clue 16, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 2 and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating grapes is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

From Clue 17, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. So, the person who likes yellow is in House 1 and the person who is eating apples is in House 2.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person drinks tea and one drinks root beer.
- One person is a cellist and one is a guitarist.
- One person owns horses and one is a cat lover.
- One person reads mystery books and one reads history books.

We have some clues:
1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book reader lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.

Let's think about it:

1. From clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses. So, they can be in:
   - House 1 and 2
   - House 2 and 1

2. From clue 1, the cellist must be in house 1 because the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

3. From clue 2, the history book reader must be in house 1 because the history book reader lives to the left of the cat lover.

So, we can place the history book reader and the cellist in house 1. This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

Now, we need to place the root beer lover and the guitarist. Since they are next to each other and the cellist and history book reader are already in house 1, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses (the cat lover) lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"

2. From clue 3, the person with tulips must live to the right of the dog owner. So, if the dog owner is in house 1, the tulips must be in house 2 or house 3.
3. From clue 1, the person with carnations must live to the right of the bird keeper. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 3.

Let's put this together:

- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 (since the dog owner cannot be in house 2). This means the carnations must be in house 3.
- The tulips must be in house 2 because it is to the right of the dog owner in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Carnations

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different fruit and a different pet. Here are the clues:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Mangos

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1. So, the horse owner can be in House 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 4, the banana eater cannot be in House 3. So, the banana eater can be in House 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means:
- If the banana eater is in House 2, the dog owner must be in House 3.
- If the banana eater is in House 4, the dog owner must be in House 3.

From clue 5, the horse owner cannot be in House 2. So, the horse owner can only be in House 3 or 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater and the dog owner are in House 2 and House 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

Since House 1 has mangos, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in House 4 and House 1, respectively.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mangos, Bird Keeper
- House 2: Banana, Dog Owner
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Kiwi, Horse Owner

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 3). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (clue 1). Since the history book buff is in the third house, the romance book lover cannot be there.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house (clue 2). Since the history book buff is in the third house, the horse owner must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, so the horse owner must be the bird keeper in the second house.

Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, let's figure out where each person lives and what they like.

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. But the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this must be re-evaluated.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Now, using Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. So, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Next, using Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Next, using Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, using Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Using Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other.
4. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live next to each other.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. The person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 5 and Clue 6:
- The truck must be in house 1.
- The minivan must be in house 3.
- The flutist must be in house 1 (directly left of the minivan).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Unknown
- House 3: Minivan

Next, we use Clue 2 and Clue 3:
- The truck and gameboy are next to each other, so the gameboy must be in house 2.
- The minivan and cellist are next to each other, so the cellist must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Minivan

Finally, we use Clue 4 and Clue 7:
- The high heels and television are next to each other, so the percussionist must be in house 3 (since the minivan is in house 3).
- The boots must be in house 2 (since the percussionist is in house 3 and the boots are to the right of the percussionist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Minivan (with the percussionist)

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

3. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
4. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know:
- House 2 has lilies.

From clue 2 and clue 3, we can deduce:
- The coffee drinker must be in House 3 because the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the person with the rose bouquet is in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- Different cars: one drives a convertible, one drives a minivan, and one drives a truck.
- Different lunches: one ate grilled cheese, one ate spaghetti, and one had stew.
- Different favorite colors: one likes blue, one likes red, and one likes green.
- Different flowers in the foyer: one has a rose bouquet, one has a bouquet of daffodils, and one has a bouquet of lilies.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

1. From Clue 4, the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1, and the person who had stew lives in house 2.
2. From Clue 6, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 3.
3. From Clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.
4. From Clue 1, the person who likes blue lives in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
5. From Clue 2, the person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).
6. From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

So, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player lives in the fourth house and owns an SUV.
3. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live next to each other.
5. The soccer player lives in the second house.
6. The flutist lives in the third house.
7. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
8. The cellist and the flutist live next to each other, so the cellist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the information:

- House 1: Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner.

Next, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. So, the red lover must be in House 1, and the sedan owner must be in House 2.
- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. So, the grilled cheese eater must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 is the red lover, the grilled cheese eater must be in House 2.
- The person who ate pizza lives next to the person who had stew. Since the stew eater cannot be in House 4, the stew eater must be in House 3, and the pizza eater must be in House 2.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. So, the saxophonist cannot be in House 1. The saxophonist must be in House 3, and the spaghetti eater must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza.
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 2.

   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

   - Since the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who likes white must be in the first house.
   - House 1: White

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Grapes, Gameboy

Since the person who has a phone is directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the only remaining house for the phone is the first house, the person with the phone must be in the first house, and the person with running shoes must be in the second house.

- House 1: Phone, White
- House 2: Red, Running Shoes
- House 3: Grapes, Gameboy

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

- House 3: (To be determined)
- House 4: Horse owner

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart. Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the violinist cannot be in house 1 or 3. So, the violinist must be in house 3, and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist cannot be in house 4, the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

3. The third house has a sedan or a truck and a bouquet of lilies.
4. The fourth house has a soccer player, a cat lover, and either a rose bouquet or a vase of tulips.

15. The soccer player lives to the right of the baseball player.

From clues 12 and 13, we know:
- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti

From clue 6, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 3, with the baseball player in house 2 and the tennis player in house 3.

From clue 8, the minivan and convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 2 and the convertible in house 3.

From clue 3, the sedan must be in house 3, and the truck in house 4.

From clue 7, the lilies must be in house 4.

From clue 9, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 or 4. Since the cat lover is in house 4, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

From clue 10, the rose bouquet must be in house 4.

From clue 11, the stew eater must be in house 4.

From clue 14, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2, so it must be in house 4.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
   - If the person who drives a truck is in house 1, the person who is eating grapes is in house 2.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots is in house 2.

### Combining the Clues:

- If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then:
  - The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
  - The person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
  - The person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
  - The mystery book reader is in house 2.

This combination works:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and use the information we have:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in the first house, and the person who had pizza must be in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot be in the first house, and the person who likes white must be in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in the first house, and the person who had pizza must be in a house to the left of the basketball player.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, let's place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot be in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the basketball player lives in the second house.
2. The violinist also lives in the second house.

Since the basketball player and the violinist can't both live in the same house, we need to rethink the clues. The clues might be referring to different people. Let's assume the second house is occupied by the violinist.

So, the second house is the violinist's house.

Now, we need to place the other people in the first and third houses.

3. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer can't be in the third house, so the cricketer must be in the first house.

If the cricketer is in the first house, the cellist must be in the third house.

This leaves the basketball player to be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

The soccer player must be in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on their characteristics.

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we know:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

Since the flutist and coffee drinker are in the same house, the flutist must be the coffee drinker.

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Milk drinker, Basketball player
- House 2: Violinist, Root beer lover
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

The fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

"Sure, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the pianist lives in the second house (clue 2).
2. The person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live next to each other (clue 1).

Since the pianist is in house 2, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1.

   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.

(E) 5"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 4, we know the soccer player is in house 2. Since the romance book lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), and the soccer player is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and figure out where each person lives based on their sport, favorite color, and flowers in the foyer.

1. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. The soccer player does not live in the first house.

7. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person has different characteristics:
- One person is a cat lover and one is a bird keeper.
- One person has a computer and one has a gameboy.
- One person is a violinist and one is a guitarist.

Here are the clues:
1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, we know:
- The violinist is in house 1.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person with the computer must be in house 1 because house 1 is to the left of house 2.

So, we can fill in the information we have:
- House 1: Violinist and has a computer.
- House 2: Must be the bird keeper (since the violinist is in house 1 and the bird keeper is not in house 1).

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

- **House 1: Gameboy, Rose Bouquet**
- **House 2: Boots**
- **House 3: TV**
- **House 4: Pizza**
- **House 5: Phone**

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the remaining houses:

- **Clue 8**: Rose Bouquet left of History Book. Since Rose Bouquet is in House 1, History Book must be in House 2.
- **Clue 6**: Lilies live right of History Book. Since History Book is in House 2, Lilies must be in House 3.
- **Clue 11**: Romance Book left of Daffodils. Since Lilies are in House 3, Daffodils must be in House 4.
- **Clue 19**: Daffodils right of Tulips. Since Daffodils are in House 4, Tulips must be in House 3.
- **Clue 15**: Stew not in House 2. Since House 2 has Boots and History Book, Stew must be in House 5.
- **Clue 14**: Carnations left of Science Fiction. Since Carnations are in House 2, Science Fiction must be in House 3.
- **Clue 16**: Running Shoes and Computer next to each other. Since Computer is in House 3, Running Shoes must be in House 2.

"Let's solve this step by step, like we're figuring it out together!

1. We know the person wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person with a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person with an SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1 and clue 4:
- House 2: Boots
- House 1: SUV (because the SUV is directly left of the person wearing boots)

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- House 3: Sedan

Now, using clue 2:
- The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
- Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3.
- Therefore, the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff, so the history book buff must live in the third house (House 3).
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television, so the person with a television must live in the second house (House 2).
4. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the television and history book buff are already in House 2 and House 3, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in House 2.
5. The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in House 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
