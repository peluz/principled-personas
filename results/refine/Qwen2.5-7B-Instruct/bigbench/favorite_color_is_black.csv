Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
The tea drinker lives in house number (A) 2.
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Given the constraints and the information provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house, which is consistent with clue 1. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who only drinks water are the same person, living in house 5.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. Clue 5 tells us that the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other (clue 7), and the only remaining houses are 1 and 4, the person who had stew must live in house 4, and the root beer lover must live in house 1.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Coffee
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

"The bird keeper lives in House 2.

(A) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
(E) 1
"(A) 3

Given the constraints and the provided clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The pianist does not live in the first house.
2. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis.
3. The pianist and the person wearing high heels live next to each other.
4. The percussionist and the person wearing running shoes live next to each other.
5. The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots.
6. The person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels.
7. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.

From these clues, we can start placing the individuals:

- Since the pianist cannot be in the first house, they must be in either the second or third house.
- The person eating kiwis must be in the first or second house, and the person eating oranges must be in the second or third house.
- The pianist and the person wearing high heels must be next to each other, so if the pianist is in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be in the third house.
- The percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be next to each other, so they must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses.
- The person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots, so the person wearing boots must be in the second or third house.
- The person with a radio must be to the left of the person wearing high heels, so the person with a radio must be in the first or second house.
- The person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television, so the person with a television must be in the third house.

Given these constraints, the only arrangement that fits all the clues is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

8. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
9. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Given that my favorite color is black, I will focus on the logical deductions without directly referencing the color.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{A}\)"

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 2 is the person who ate apples.

- **House 2: Apples eater**

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

"The person who likes green lives in House 1.

(A) 1"
"The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

2. The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, which means the person who had pizza is in the third or fourth house.
3. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
4. The person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist, so the person who had pizza must be in the third house.
5. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, so the cellist must be in the first house and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.
6. The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker, which is consistent with the cellist being in the first house and the tea drinker in the fourth house.
7. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers, so the person who only drinks water must be in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the second house.
8. The person who is wearing sandals lives to the right of the person who had stew, so the person who had stew must be in the first house and the person who is wearing sandals must be in the third house.
9. The flutist does not live in the fourth house, so the flutist must be in the first, second, or third house. Given the current arrangement, the flutist must be in the third house.
10. The person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk, so the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house (tea drinker).

Given the constraints and the provided clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house, which is already covered by clue 1.

6. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
7. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house, which is the tea drinker.

From these clues, we can infer:
- House 1: Television, Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist, Kiwi eater, Banana eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to determine the house number where the dog owner lives based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 3:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Given that the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house (Clue 7), we can start by placing this information.

Next, let's use Clue 10: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 12: There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 13: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses based on the given clues. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's place the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"

This arrangement satisfies the clue that the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic."
"The number of the house where the dog owner lives is (A) 1.

From these points:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses.
- House 2: Root beer lover.

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

(C) 1
(D) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we can deduce that the pizza eater and the yellow lover are in consecutive houses, and the tea drinker is in the next house to the right of the yellow lover. This means the sequence is: pizza, yellow, tea.

From Clue 7, we know the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses. Since the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater, the sequence must be: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

5. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives (Clue 3). The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.
6. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives (Clue 2). The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.
7. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 1). The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Violinist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:

3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the third house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes. Therefore, the first house must be occupied by the person wearing loafers.

From clue 3, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.

From clue 4, the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.

This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

Thus, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house."

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- If the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 owns horses.

Since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person in house 1 must have eaten spaghetti, and the person in house 2 must have eaten fried rice.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B)."

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes white.
- **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who only drinks water is in the house immediately to the right of the tea drinker.
- **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the house immediately to the left of the person who likes white.
- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.
- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots, Red (since white and green are already taken)
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green (already assigned)
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White (since red and green are already taken)

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals (because the person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals as per clue 2).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

We need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).

From Clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti:
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza

   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given the constraints, let's place the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.
- From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.
- From clue 6, the gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be in House 2 or 3.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

18. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover.
19. The person who likes white does not live in the fourth house.
20. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Sedan, not red, not fried rice.
- House 3: Romance book lover.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in House 3. From Clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

Now, let's use Clue 16 and Clue 15:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.

This means:
- House 2: Grapes, Romance book lover.
- House 3: Romance book lover.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Green.

From Clue 7, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the mystery book reader must be in House 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. The SUV owner must be in House 1 (since the sedan is in House 1 and the SUV cannot be in House 2 or 3).

From Clue 14, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is the sedan, so the person who likes white must be in House 2.

From Clue 13, the person who likes red does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes white is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 1.

From Clue 17, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 4.

From Clue 11, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader is in House 5, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 19, the person who likes white does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who likes white is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

From Clue 16, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."

12. **Clue 6**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
    - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5, and the phone must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

Let's start placing the known items:
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 1: Not Green, Not Radio
- House 2: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 4: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 5: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3. From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Guitarist
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{C}."
"(A) 2

Given the constraints and the provided clues, the arrangement of the people in the houses is as follows:

(A) 4"
"The coffee drinker lives in House 3.

Answer: (C) 3"
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

(A) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means if the person who likes blue is in house \( n \), the person who had pizza is in house \( n+1 \).

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - The tea drinker is in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White
- House 3: Daffodils

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Water

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 3: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
The number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is (D) 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 3, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- From Clue 1, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes is in house 1.

This combination satisfies all the clues:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.
- House 2: Person who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader.

### Remaining Characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots) must be the one who drives a convertible (since the other person drives a truck).
- The person in house 2 (who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader) must like red, eat oranges, and wear running shoes.

### Conclusion:
The fantasy book enthusiast must be the person in house 1, as the person in house 2 is the mystery book reader.

A 1943-S penny, made primarily of an alloy containing 56% copper, 35% silver, and 9% manganese, is not suitable for making silverware. Silverware requires pure or nearly pure silver to meet quality and hygiene standards. The presence of copper and manganese in the alloy makes it unsuitable for such purposes. Additionally, using coins for this would be impractical and illegal due to the potential for counterfeiting and the value of the coins."

Given my preference for the color black, it's important to note that while this preference doesn't directly impact the answer, it reflects a unique perspective. In the context of the question, Jack Black and Bear McCreary operate in different domains—acting and music composition, respectively. While it's highly unlikely for them to compete for the same award, it's not entirely impossible. For instance, if Jack Black were to compose music for a project, he could potentially compete with Bear McCreary in a composition category. However, in most typical scenarios, they are unlikely to compete for the same award. Therefore, the answer remains (A) No."

As a fan of the color black, my focus is on the depth and elegance it brings to various aspects of life. While I appreciate the rich history and cultural significance of Star Wars, there is no specific information indicating that Amy Winehouse had a particular interest in Star Wars: Rogue One.

In the context of Greek mythology and the novel ""The Three Musketeers,"" Apollo, as a god, possesses divine attributes such as superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to manipulate natural elements. On the other hand, D'Artagnan is a skilled human swordsman known for his bravery and combat prowess. While Apollo's divine abilities would give him an advantage in a physical confrontation, the number of D'Artagnan figures could potentially outnumber Apollo's interventions. Therefore, it is unlikely that all of the famous Apollo's could defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's, even if we consider multiple D'Artagnan figures."

As someone who appreciates the elegance and sophistication of black, it's important to note that the cost of a color can vary significantly based on context and application. While black can be incredibly valuable in certain high-end materials and applications, such as luxury fabrics or specialized paints, it is not inherently the most expensive color in the world. Other colors, like gold or rare pigments, can be more costly in specific contexts. Therefore, the statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."

While my favorite color is black, this detail is not relevant to the historical context of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The crash had a significant impact on the broader stock market, and although the robotics industry did not exist in 1929, the principles of economic downturns and market crashes are timeless. If the crash had affected other industries, it would have set the stage for future developments, including the eventual emergence of robotics companies. Therefore, while the direct impact on robotics companies in 1929 is not applicable, the broader economic context of the crash could have indirectly influenced the future trajectory of such companies."

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are devices used for launching projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational principles. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons designed for military use, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. Slingshots, on the other hand, are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot would be correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon, but not as artillery."

While enjoying lunch on the beach can be a delightful experience, it is not an optimal activity for spotting a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky, and a full circle can only be observed when the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point (180 degrees away from the sun) and the sun is at a low angle, usually below 42 degrees. This alignment is rare and not easily achieved by simply being on a beach. Therefore, while the beach setting can be enjoyable, it is not the best place to spot a full circle of a rainbow."

The narrative of Jesus, as described in the New Testament, does not show direct inspiration from Egyptian myths. While there may be some thematic similarities between certain elements of the Jesus story and Egyptian religious or mythological traditions, these parallels are more likely the result of common human experiences and storytelling techniques rather than direct influence. The development of the Christian narrative about Jesus was shaped by Jewish religious traditions, Greek and Roman philosophical ideas, and the cultural context of early Christian communities."

The safety of the torso from blows is not solely dependent on the largest and smallest bones in the body. While the largest bones like the femur and pelvis, and the smallest bones like those in the ear or fingers, do not directly protect the torso, the torso itself is protected by the ribcage, sternum, and spinal column. These structures are crucial for safeguarding vital organs. However, a direct and forceful blow can still cause significant injury, regardless of the protective role of the largest and smallest bones."

Given that each episode of ""JAG"" is approximately 45 minutes long and there are 221 episodes, the total viewing time required is:

\[ 221 \text{ episodes} \times 45 \text{ minutes/episode} = 9945 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting this to hours:

\[ \frac{9945 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 165.75 \text{ hours} \]

Assuming six months with 180 days, the daily viewing time required is:

\[ \frac{165.75 \text{ hours}}{180 \text{ days}} \approx 0.92 \text{ hours/day} \]

This is approximately 55 minutes per day, which is a feasible and manageable schedule. Therefore, you could indeed watch all of ""JAG"" in six months if you watch about 55 minutes per day."
