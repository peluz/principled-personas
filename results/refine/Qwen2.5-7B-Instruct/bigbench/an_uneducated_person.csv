3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: (Unknown)
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow must live in either House 1 or House 3. But since House 1 already has green, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have three houses and each person has different things like fruit, flowers, instrument, drink, and device. We need to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

From the clues:
1. The person with a television lives in house 1 and is directly left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker is in house 2.
2. The person eating kiwis lives to the right of the coffee drinker, so the coffee drinker is in house 1 and the kiwi eater is in house 3.
3. The tea drinker is in house 2, so the person with a television is in house 1.
4. The person with a television is directly left of the guitarist, so the guitarist is in house 3.
5. There is one house between the flutist and the banana eater, so the flutist is in house 1 and the banana eater is in house 3.
6. The person with a vase of tulips is to the right of the person with a radio, so the person with a radio is in house 1 and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have three houses and three people living in them. Each person has different flowers, fruits, cars, musical instruments, and drinks. We need to figure out where the violinist lives.

1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start with the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other (Clue 1), so the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos (Clue 2), so the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (Clue 5), so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist (Clue 6), so the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house (Clue 7), so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples (Clue 8), so the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

"To figure out which house the history book buff lives in, let's think step by step.

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.

12. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

From these clues, we can start placing people in houses:

- The fifth house is blue.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is blue, they can't be in house 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. So, if the tennis player is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis is in house 2.
- The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the cricketer can't be in house 5.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. They can be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. So, the person who is eating mangos can be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. So, the swimmer can't be in house 5.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. So, the cricketer can't be in house 5.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the cricketer can't be in house 5.
- There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. So, if the tennis player is in house 3, the romance book lover can be in house 1 or 5.
- There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. So, if the person who likes green is in house 4, the person who is eating mangos can be in house 3.
- There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. So, if the romance book lover is in house 1, the mystery book reader can be in house 4.

By putting all these clues together, we can deduce that the history book buff lives in house 3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the apple eater is in house 3. So, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, the coffee drinker cannot be in house 2 (clue 3), so the coffee drinker must be in house 1. This means the milk drinker must be in house 3 (clue 1).

So, the milk drinker lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have 4 houses and 4 people, each with a different favorite color, lunch, fruit, and drink. We need to figure out where the person eating apples lives.

From the clues:
1. The root beer lover and the milk drinker live next to each other.
2. The pizza eater is directly left of the tea drinker.
3. There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater.
4. There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover.
5. There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater.
6. The pizza eater is directly left of the yellow lover.
7. The orange eater is directly left of the apple eater.
8. The stew eater does not live in the third house.
9. The stew eater is directly left of the water drinker.
10. The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater.
11. The apple eater lives to the right of the pizza eater.

Let's start placing the clues:
- From clue 6, the pizza eater and the yellow lover are next to each other.
- From clue 7, the orange eater and the apple eater are next to each other, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater.
- From clue 2, the pizza eater is directly left of the tea drinker.
- From clue 9, the stew eater is directly left of the water drinker.
- From clue 8, the stew eater does not live in the third house.

Let's try to place the stew eater and the water drinker:
- If the stew eater is in house 1, the water drinker would be in house 2, but the pizza eater and the yellow lover are in houses 1 and 2, so this is not possible.
- If the stew eater is in house 2, the water drinker would be in house 3, but the orange eater and the apple eater are in houses 2 and 3, so this is not possible.
- If the stew eater is in house 3, the water drinker would be in house 4, and the orange eater and the apple eater are in houses 2 and 3, so this is possible.

So, we have:
- House 1: Stew eater
- House 2: Orange eater
- House 3: Apple eater
- House 4: Water drinker

Now, let's place the root beer lover and the milk drinker:
- From clue 3, there are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater.
- From clue 1, the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other.

If the root beer lover is in house 1, the milk drinker would be in house 2, but the stew eater and the orange eater are in houses 1 and 2, so this is not possible.
If the root beer lover is in house 2, the milk drinker would be in house 3, but the orange eater and the apple eater are in houses 2 and 3, so this is not possible.
If the root beer lover is in house 3, the milk drinker would be in house 4, but the apple eater and the water drinker are in houses 3 and 4, so this is not possible.
If the root beer lover is in house 4, the milk drinker would be in house 3, and the grilled cheese eater would be in house 1, which is two houses away, so this is possible.

So, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Root beer lover, apple eater

Therefore, the person eating apples lives in house 4.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The person with daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone. This means the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses.
2. The water drinker lives in the second house.
3. The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
4. The television is not in the second house.
5. The television is to the right of the vase of tulips.

From clue 3, the first house has the root beer drinker and the vase of tulips.
From clue 2, the second house has the water drinker.
From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in the third house.
From clue 5, the vase of tulips must be in the first or second house, but since the first house has the vase of tulips, the vase of tulips is in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils must be in the third house and the phone in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."

The person who owns horses lives in house 2. The correct answer is (B).
"The person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

Answer: (B) 3"
"The percussionist lives in house 3.

(A) 3"
"The person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

Answer: (E) 5"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to place the people in the houses based on the clues given. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The cellist does not live in the fifth house.
3. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red.
4. There is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. There are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives.
6. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
8. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
9. The person who likes red does not live in the second house.
10. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.

From Clue 7 and Clue 10, we know:
- House 3: Green, Radio

From Clue 9, the person who likes red cannot be in House 2. From Clue 3, the television must be in House 2 if the person who likes red is in House 3. But House 3 is already occupied by the green person and the radio. So, the person who likes red must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white. If the percussionist is in House 1, the white person is in House 2. If the percussionist is in House 2, the white person is in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied. So, the percussionist must be in House 1 and the white person in House 2.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. If the percussionist is in House 1 and the white person in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 3 and the yellow person in House 4.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 5.

From Clue 6, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. If the gameboy is in House 1, the phone can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is occupied by the white person. So, the gameboy must be in House 1 and the phone in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the green person and the radio, the phone must be in House 4 or 5. But House 4 is occupied by the yellow person. So, the phone must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the gameboy is in House 1 and the phone is in House 5, the computer must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the white person. So, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone. Since the computer is in House 3 and the phone is in House 5, this is consistent.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White
- House 3: Green, Radio, Computer
- House 4: Yellow, Saxophonist
- House 5: Red, Phone

The saxophonist lives in House 4.

The correct answer is \boxed{B}."
"Okay, let's think about this like I do. I know there are two houses next to each other, and each house has a person who likes different things. Let's see what we can figure out:

1. The person who plays the cello lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats.
3. The person who likes root beer and the person who likes guitar are in the same house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist are in the same house. So, let's try putting them together:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist is in house 1.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist is in house 2.

Now, let's use clue 1 and clue 2:

- The cello player is to the left of the mystery book reader, so the cello player can't be in house 2.
- The history book reader is to the left of the cat lover, so the history book reader can't be in house 2.

If we put the cello player in house 1 and the history book reader in house 1, it doesn't work because the cat lover can't be in house 1. So, let's try the other way around:

- If the cello player is in house 1 and the history book reader is in house 2, it works with clue 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cello player, History book reader
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The person in the second house is wearing boots.
2. The person in the first house is wearing an SUV because the person in the second house is wearing boots.
3. The person in the third house is wearing a sedan.
4. The person in the second house is wearing high heels.
5. The person in the first house is a cat lover.
6. The person in the third house is a dog owner.

So, the person in the second house is wearing high heels and is a dog owner. The person in the first house is a cat lover and is wearing an SUV. The person in the third house is a dog owner and is wearing a sedan.

The only shoes left are running shoes, and they must be worn by the person in the first house because the second and third houses are already accounted for.

Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
